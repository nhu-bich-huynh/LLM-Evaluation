"Text"
"That is clearly wrong."
"There are several technologies for simultaneously reducing particulate emissions and NOx emissions to the level called for at first reading, either by using the ammonia process or else by using charge cooling combined with a regeneration filter."
"So there are various options, and these options are not just theoretical, they are at the prototype stage."
"That means that we do not need to worry about this not being technically feasible."
"In addition, this would also be a waste of engineering effort, and would make economic nonsense."
"But we also need to take this step for ecological reasons, of course."
"Why?"
"We are, for instance, talking about a target ozone limit value for 2010 which is 80% below the current value in the European Union."
"If we really want to achieve that, then it is specifically the NOx emissions from lorries and buses that we will also have to reduce."
"In the European Union we have 168 million cars and 23 million commercial vehicles and buses."
"These 23 million commercial vehicles emit as much as the 168 million cars, that is 50% of total NOx emissions."
"So we absolutely must do something about it!"
"The second point on which the Council has been rather cautious is re-equipping older vehicles."
"We know that lorries and buses have a long life and tend to clock up high mileages."
"So it is of the utmost importance to encourage re-equipping of such vehicles, so that older vehicles become cleaner as well."
"Thirdly, the Council has been rather cautious about introducing enhanced environmentally friendly vehicles - an area where we have proposed several additions - and about strict controls to prevent cycle beating, as has already happened in the USA. This means that manufacturers can simply get round limit values by electronic manipulation."
"We need to add something here."
"Emissions legislation aimed at improving air quality has been a success story, and we have an opportunity to put the icing on the cake."
"Of course we also need to be highly ambitious with our proposals when we go into the conciliation procedure."
"We want to emerge with a good compromise, so we cannot take a compromise as our starting point."
"I therefore call on all of us to be courageous, to achieve a swift conciliation procedure and to work together to ensure that our success story - improving air quality in Europe - really is a success right to the end."
"Madam President, may I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on the report he has now drafted."
"I think - and Madam President you will know from your own experience - that the action taken by Parliament in the case of the Auto-Oil issue was very courageous indeed."
"We have tried to clean up passenger cars as well as truck traffic, including heavy commercial vehicles, and not just the cars as such, but we have also tried to ensure that clean fuels are used."
"This whole package will ensure that air quality will indeed improve."
"The only encouraging thing I have read recently about the environment, in the Dutch press, is that this improvement in air quality owing to the use of cleaner cars is already in evidence."
"I would be dishonest if I failed to mention that a few people in our Group do not fully agree with the report and the amendments proposed by the Environment Committee."
"I think that, possibly, further negotiations need to take place where further compromises can be reached before the vote takes place."
"The people who are of the opinion that the requirements now prescribed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and its rapporteur, Mr Lange, for heavy commercial vehicles, are too strict, should consider the following."
"In Europe, we still boast a sound automotive industry for heavy and light vehicles."
"The same automotive industry exports vehicles to the United States which must already meet stricter requirements or, at least, the requirements as prescribed at present."
"I think it is in no-one' s interest that we in Europe set lower standards than what would be perfectly feasible, even in the longer term."
"This is why I urge that the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection actually be adopted in tomorrow' s vote."
"Madam President, the legislative project under discussion is very important for the issue of air protection."
"It has a direct effect on the quality of the air we breathe, that is to say the air' s nitrogen dioxide content and the amounts of ozone being formed in the atmosphere."
"All this also has an effect on acidification and eutrophication."
"It will also reduce the number of particles in the air that are hazardous to health."
"All this can only succeed sufficiently well, however, if the action required under the directive is taken as quickly as possible."
"The most difficult challenge is the rapidly increasing volume of transport, which is predicted to double between 1990 and 2006."
"In my opinion, the rapporteur, Mr Lange, is quite right when he proposes that heavy goods vehicles should be included in a common strategy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic as quickly as possible."
"We have to respond to the race against increased emissions by speeding up the adoption of measures to reduce them."
"I therefore offer my strong support to the rapporteur' s proposal that new limit values be introduced as quickly as the latest technology allows and certainly not only once the Member States happen to approve them."
"In a market economy, money is the deciding force."
"Therefore we have to use financial pressure to push forward environmental values."
"Tax incentives have had a major importance in encouraging the use of more environment-friendly fuels."
"Using tax concessions as a carrot to replace heavy old commercial vehicles is well justified, as are tax benefits for environment-friendly vehicles."
"All this would serve to speed up the introduction of vehicles that pollute the environment less."
"I would now like to mention a change that would cost nothing."
"You yourselves must daily encounter situations where heavy vehicles such as buses and construction machinery leave their engine running at times when nothing is going on."
"Imagine how much we could reduce air contamination if we did not let our vehicle engines idle in this way."
"It really costs nothing."
"It is just a question of attitudes."
"Madam President, the topic of today' s sitting is making trucks more environmentally friendly."
"In my book and, of course, in anyone else' s, this is a contradiction in terms. Trucks pollute."
"This is what they do. And since freight transport, in particular the international variety, invariably takes place by road, we cannot do much more than endeavour to reduce this harmfulness."
"As far as this is concerned, a compliment is in order for the Committee and the Council, but, above all, for the rapporteur."
"Given the number of amendments adopted in first reading, his role as a rapporteur can be seen as an outright success."
"We are very satisfied, even at this early stage, with the outcome before us."
"We are now dealing with the second reading of a directive, aspects of which will need to be introduced as early as the year 2000."
"This is why we are under a certain amount of time pressure."
"The rapporteur is re-opening a number of previous proposals."
"We can support him in many of those, but there is one section where we do not support the rapporteur but rather the Council' s common position, and this concerns the two-stage approach to the NOx limit value of EURO IV stage."
"I heard very clearly what the rapporteur says about this."
"However, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party considers that if this limit value for 2006 is laid down now, it will, in practice, force industry to apply one specific technology, whilst we are not entirely convinced of the environmental friendliness of this technology."
"In our opinion, evaluation in 2002 and implementation in 2008 offer a better chance of using a more effective technology."
"Moreover, the Council proposes introducing a category of very environmentally friendly vehicles."
"We welcome this proposal in which these vehicles are linked with tax incentives."
"We also listened with great interest to the rapporteur with regard to the improvements he is intending to incorporate in this proposal."
"Also, we give our full backing to the rapporteur' s proposals to cut CO2 emissions so that we can achieve the Kyoto objectives, but also to the tax incentives for adapting older vehicles and the adjustment of test conditions, so that actual emissions of vehicles in use can be measured, albeit in the longer term."
"Madam President, my colleague, Mr Lange, has again produced an excellent report, which will have a considerable effect on air quality, and our Group unreservedly supports it."
"Trucks and buses contribute to air pollution in ever greater proportions, as we have actually done a lot to reduce car emissions, for example by using better quality fuels and tax concessions, as Mrs Myller said."
"In the first reading, Parliament was very successful in getting through strict limit values for particulate pollutants, which are very dangerous for the health."
"The Ministers of the Environment then adopted Parliament' s proposal and now our job is to demand that industry adopts just as strict a line on nitrogen emissions."
"Industry needs sufficient time, and industry will certainly get the time it needs to prepare itself for this technological change."
"The engineers have proved very inventive before, and I trust that the right technology will be in place by 2006."
"Madam President, in the discussion of the various parts of the Auto-Oil programme, we in the European Parliament have pressed for a tightening up of the requirements."
"We ought to continue to do so, both now and in the future."
"As a result, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left shall be voting for just about all the amendments from rapporteur Lange."
"We think it is our role to ensure in this situation that the best possible technology is used as early as possible."
"I am also convinced that some of the pressure which has been exerted on us as Members of the European Parliament in connection with this issue has exaggerated the difficulties involved in adjusting to the demands made in this recommendation for second reading."
"I am rather hesitant about one section."
"This is section 11, about whether a time limit should now be set for financial incentives in connection with environmentally friendly vehicles."
"However, this is a minor question in this context."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for producing a very good piece of work on a matter which is technically quite complicated."
"The European Union and national Member States must work closely together at all times with Europe' s motor and oil industry so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future."
"The great car culture has been referred to before in European Parliament reports as the main culprit of air pollution in Europe and Parliament is now playing an active role in establishing limit values for various pollutants so as to bring this environmental problem under control."
"It goes without saying that the European Parliament must support a whole raft of measures to control environmental pollution in order to comply with its obligations under the Kyoto Agreement to reduce the level of European Union emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8% by the years 2008-2012."
"I would point out that the European Commission and the European Parliament have held extensive consultations with the European automobile industry on these various matters, and it has voluntarily agreed to accept a timetable to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new cars by 25% by the year 2008."
"We have made extensive progress over the last few years in relation to meeting these problems, for example with the systems installed in cars which have completed 80,000 kilometres and which were built over five years ago, to monitor the durability of anti-pollution equipment."
"We have tax incentives which must also be used to encourage the early introduction of vehicles containing advanced anti-pollution equipment."
"We will support the phasing out of the sale of leaded petrol."
"We have also supported measures which would guarantee that the sulphur content in petrol will be cut three-fold and that the sulphur content in diesel will be reduced seven-fold by the year 2005."
"The Lange report this evening on the control of emissions of gases and other pollutants produced by vehicles continues the progress we have been making."
"May I say in conclusion that since May of this year the European Parliament has the power of codecision on all environmental matters as a result of the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty?"
"The European Parliament must and should use these new powers to push forward an even stronger legislation in the area of environmental control."
"I support Mr Lange and congratulate him on his report."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Lange on his report in second reading."
"He has once again delivered excellent work with regard to making traffic more environmentally friendly."
"After the Auto-Oil programme for passenger cars, a sound approach has been adopted with regard to heavy-duty vehicles too."
"I am also pleased with what the Council adopted from Parliament in first reading."
"It is clear that consensus within Parliament has led to good results in the Council."
"However, I fail to grasp why, when agreement has been reached in the Council, Parliament should have to wait so long for the official common position."
"I actually find this important enough to raise as an issue."
"I fear, namely, that it will increasingly become a habit for common positions to be held up."
"The Council could, of course, say that the procedure has become more complex since the entry into effect of the Treaty of Amsterdam and therefore requires more time."
"However, I cannot see the difference in this respect."
"A text had to be laid down prior to Amsterdam and this is still the case after Amsterdam."
"Alongside this, I should add that such delays create huge problems for the implementation of the relevant legislation."
"This is certainly the case for heavy-duty vehicles."
"For the car industry, it is essential to know exactly what is going to happen and when."
"If the decision-making process occurs much later than necessary, then it is impossible for the car industry to accommodate this adequately."
"It is now the case that, regarding the strict NOx values, some car industries are aiming for 2005, first reading of the European Parliament, others for 2008, the Council' s common position, and some others still for 2006, the draft recommendation for the second reading."
"This intermediate phase is creating a great deal of confusion as it is."
"Timely clarity in this respect is what is called for."
"As for my reaction to the content of the proposal, it is only natural that Mr Lange would like to see a few improvements made."
"If we are serious about meeting the Kyoto objectives, then this sector certainly is important."
"The vehicles concerned are large, have a high mileage and, as such, cause high levels of CO2 emission."
"More far-reaching investment into more economical engines, and not just for passenger cars, will certainly have an effect."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to take concrete action."
"I am also in favour of tax incentives for the vehicle category of very environmentally friendly vehicles."
"This will help ensure that the proposed emissions are achieved in good time."
"Mr Lange is right in indicating that, alongside standards for emissions, standards will also come into play for other aspects of these environmentally friendly vehicles, such as noise and fuel consumption, which was mentioned earlier."
"Certainly in terms of noise, heavy-duty vehicles play a key role."
"Needless to say, test cycles for measuring vehicle exhaust gas values should mimic the real driving situation as soon as possible."
"Negotiations on a worldwide harmonised dynamic test procedure is also a step in the right direction."
"By way of conclusion, I would like to say that I fully agree with Mr Lange' s report."
"I will therefore vote in favour of all his amendments."
"It would be good if Parliament and the Council were to draft a sound directive without a conciliation procedure."
"Unfortunately, over the past couple of weeks, the Council has clearly stated that it is not prepared to adopt draft amendments from the second reading."
"This may well result in a conciliation procedure, which will, in turn, cause delays."
"This is why I would like once again to urge the Council - and will do so via the European Commission if need be - to adopt the sound proposals tabled by Mr Lange."
"Mr President, Mr Lange has submitted a first-class report on behalf of the Environment Committee."
"On 20 December last, the Council of Environment Ministers adopted sound amendments from Mrs Hautala. These comprised strict limit values aimed at preventing air pollution and carcinogenic particulate emissions from trucks."
"Unfortunately, the Council has decided in favour of 2008, compared to Parliament' s 2005."
"Mrs Hautala has already touched upon this."
"I would like to discuss CO2 emissions from trucks."
"The European Commission needs to table proposals fast."
"With regard to ordinary cars, Parliament had expressed its preference for a three-litre car in 2010."
"We have ended up with a feeble compromise of an agreement relating to a six-litre car in 2010."
"No agreements have been reached at all for trucks, whilst the mileage of trucks is rising at an alarming rate."
"It is expected that it will rise by 40% by 2015."
"This is why I would ask the Committee to submit a directive for more economical trucks."
"Otherwise, we will never meet the Kyoto objectives."
"Mr President, when, in the autumn of 1998, the European Parliament made a decision to continue with the Auto-Oil Programme, the matter was timetabled to return to Parliament in good time to facilitate a Council decision during the spring of 1999."
"However, the German Government, which sat on the issue during its Presidency, clearly had other ideas."
"The matter was seriously delayed and did not return to Parliament until the middle of the summer."
"If the initial timetable had been followed, the manufacturers would probably by now already have certified the requirement in stage 3 of the Programme."
"Environmentally more friendly diesel vehicles would already have begun to be driven on European roads."
"Now, Mr Lange has drafted comprehensive amendments at this late stage in the discussion of the issue."
"If Parliament complies with Mr Lange' s proposals, there will be further delays."
"That would not be good for the environment in Europe."
"Europe presents a variety of faces."
"Sweden and Finland, especially their northern parts, are very much dependent upon efficient road transport."
"It is quite right that we should impose tough environmental requirements upon motor vehicle manufacturers."
"They should really need to employ absolutely all their skills and knowledge in accomplishing the tasks we set them."
"We must not however draw up proposals in such a way that they contain aspects which are bad for the environment."
"If our decisions lead to the simplest solution becoming general practice, which is to say that of basing exhaust purification technology on catalytic converters which require large admixtures of ammonia solution, then the distribution system alone, involving the distribution of this ammonia solution to all petrol stations throughout Europe, would mean that a not insignificant portion of the environmental benefits would be lost."
"A technical solution like that would be especially problematic for us in northern Europe."
"I want to say too that the EU cannot provide direction in Europe by means of directives which are not adapted to the real situation throughout Europe."
"Let us make very high environmental demands, but let industry too have the time it needs to develop the best possible technical solutions for the future which are good for Europe' s countryside and for the environment in Europe' s large population centres."
"From this perspective, the common position is a better alternative for the environment than continued delay."
"Mr President, we are looking at a proposal for a directive under the Auto-Oil programme, with the aim of improving air quality by the year 2010 by reducing emissions from motor vehicles."
"I personally feel that the Council has included many highly important provisions in its common position, such as reducing emission limits for carbon monoxide by October 2000 or 2001 by 30% in comparison with 1996."
"We always face the same problem, and I can remember our discussing that, Mr Lange: you promised to come to an arrangement with the Council so that your amendments would be accepted in part."
"The question now is this: what are we to do?"
"Are we to vote for your amendments tomorrow or the day after?"
"Will there be a hold-up?"
"I wonder what is really better for the environment now."
"I very much regret that the arrangement with the Council has not worked out."
"We are really faced with a decision on a matter of conscience, and this evening I will have another very good look at all this, because things have not worked out as we discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"There is one thing we need to be clear about: the Council has accepted a great many important points here, but our cars are not yet clean by a long chalk, and they never will be."
"Who would have believed that we would now be facing an explosion in traffic not only in the industrialised nations but also in the Third World?"
"It has not even begun to take off in those countries yet, and it is bound to grow further - and I can only wish for the population of those countries that it will."
"Perhaps, Mr Lange, you could try again to reach some sort of compromise with the Council during an overnight meeting. In that way, we will all be relieved from having to decide on a matter of principle, that is whether to vote against your very good report - which I would dearly like to vote for - or else, I think it is fair to say, to vote against the environment, by procrastinating yet again."
"Mr President, as I see it, the report before us today on reducing exhaust emissions from heavy goods vehicles serves to carry forward our efforts to improve air quality in Europe whilst preserving our citizens' mobility."
"No one has said so yet, but that is guaranteed too."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"The report largely addresses the critical issues and fits in well with existing clean air legislation."
"At this point I would like to make a general comment about the formal structure of the report."
"I wonder if the technical criteria set out in the annex really are a matter for us to discuss as Members of Parliament."
"Without expert guidance, the annexes are simply impenetrable for most of us - that has been my experience at least."
"I think perhaps that in future, with technical reports like this, the Legal Service should bring them into line with what we have already proposed and agreed upon."
"I would also like to comment on the most difficult and controversial points of this second reading, in terms of content."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the transition to new standards should be done in a single stage."
"By setting the deadline for 2006, we are demonstrating to the Council that we are willing to compromise, as we too will be making a concession as compared with the first reading."
"I consider that the Council proposal, which does not provide for this to be introduced until 2008, is not acceptable here."
"The directive on improving fuel quality and the catalytic converter technology now available make it possible for the Council and Parliament to come up with a truly ambitious project, without burdening industry and the transport sector with charges."
"Let me remind you of our experience with the Auto-Oil programme for cars."
"We stuck to our guns then, and it has now turned out that we took the right approach."
"Another important point, as I see it, is to encourage re-equipping of older vehicles by means of fiscal and other incentives."
"I think there is enormous potential here."
"Heavy goods vehicles have a very long service life."
"We should most definitely look at the fiscal options, even if the conversion only meets one criterion."
"This is an area where a lot more can be achieved."
"By and large, I am very pleased..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
". First of all let me express my thanks to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for acting quickly to present the second reading of the report on this dossier."
"The second reading of the report contains a number of amendments which the Commission can support, for example the amendments relating to the Enhanced Environmentally-Friendly Vehicles, the EEVs concept."
"The EEVs provide for a fuel and technology-neutral concept based on the best available technology which will allow Member States or local authorities to encourage the use of the vehicles which qualify as EEVs through tax incentives."
"EEVs will always be a concept which will complement future mandatory emission limits."
"Therefore the Commission can accept in principle to study the possible expansion of the scope of the EEV concept to include perhaps other vehicle characteristics such as noise and fuel consumption and other propulsion technologies."
"The Commission can also support the amendments relating to the expansion of the directive to include other alternative fuels, in this case ethanol, the amendment relating to tax incentives applied to the re-equipment of old vehicles, the amendment to include heavy-duty vehicles in the overall Community CO2 strategy and the amendment relating to the market quality of liquefied petroleum gas."
"The Commission can also support in principle the amendment that deals with abnormal emission control strategies, but we would prefer to see the reporting date on this issue deferred."
"A reporting date at the end of 2002 would enable the Commission to fully evaluate the effects of the new type-approval test cycles being introduced from next year on the regulation of in-use emissions from new European vehicles."
"In adopting a common position with much more stringent limits for particulates, we should note that the Council moved a significant way towards the view expressed by the European Parliament in the first reading."
"The Commission supports this precautionary approach towards the emissions of ultra-fine particulates."
"Now the main issue in this package of amendments for second reading is the early application date of stringent limits for oxides of nitrogen, NOx."
"The Commission believes that the state of development of the necessary technology to achieve such stringent NOx limits makes it difficult at the moment to accept a date earlier than October 2008."
"In this regard the technology feasibility review is necessary, since the emission control devices to meet the ambitious NOx limits are still under development."
"While they have demonstrated great promise in laboratory trials, there is no certainty yet as to the long-term operational efficiency of such devices which will make them a viable and durable technical solution to achieve emissions controls in the longer term."
"There are also important issues still to be resolved with respect to the quality of market fuels and notably sulphur content."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept the following amendments: the first part of Amendment No 3, Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 10, Amendments Nos 16 to 26 and Amendments Nos 29 to 47."
"The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 13, both parts of Amendment No 12 and Amendment No 15."
"The amendments which the Commission cannot accept are Amendment No 2, the second part of Amendment No 3, Amendments Nos 8 and 9, both parts of Amendment No 11 as well as Amendments Nos 14, 27 and 28."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Daphne Programme 2000-2003"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0056/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a Community action programme (the Daphne Programme 2000-2003) concerning measures to prevent violence against children, young people and women [9150/1/1999-C5-0181/1999 - 1998/0192(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Avilés Perea)."
"Mr President, in this plenary sitting we are presenting the Daphne Community action programme on preventive measures to fight violence against children, young people and women."
"Violence is a social problem of regrettable topical importance which involves the violation of human rights and a physical, mental and social crime as well as a crime against people' s quality of life."
"The Daphne Programme 2000-2003 will be an instrument of vital importance in the fight against violence and will provide added value to local, regional and national actions in this field through the creation of networks, the exchange of information, better practices and cooperation and greater awareness in society in general."
"The common position expressly mentions the victims of exploitation and sexual abuse which would be covered by the programme, as well as the common establishment of priorities, promoting innovation and the exchange of experiences regarding actions taken by Member States, including the exchange of information on different legislation and the results obtained."
"Non-governmental organisations should be promoted, in particular those which are concerned with the well-being and quality of life of children, young people and women."
"The present programme will last four years, and an evaluation of its progress is planned for two years after its implementation."
"The actions will also have the aim of improving public and media awareness with regard to this grave problem."
"The budget for implementation will be EUR 20 million and the Community contribution to the funding of the programmes will vary, up to a maximum of 80% of the cost of the action."
"In the implementation of this action, the Commission will be assisted by a committee consisting of representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission."
"The programme will be open to the countries of the European Free Trade Area, the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the European agreements, and to Cyprus, Malta and Turkey by means of supplementary credits."
"The aim of the Daphne programme is to support and recognise the work carried out by the non-governmental organisations, as well as other organisations - including the public authorities which are concerned with violence - and to ensure that they cooperate with each other, in the exchange of good practices - including pilot projects on a Community scale on the prevention of violence - and the support and protection of children, young people and women."
"The networks will form a common front against violence by analysing it, in its different forms, its causes and consequences."
"The real impact of the different types of violence on victims must be measured, in order to determine suitable responses, evaluate the types and the efficiency of the measures and practices in order to prevent and detect violence, support victims and prevent their future exposure to it."
"This programme, as I have said, will be an important weapon in the fight against violence towards women, young people and children in terms of improving social and media awareness of the need to help and protect the victims of violence."
"Six amendments to the common position have been presented, which have been approved by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and are in the annex to the text."
"I would like to point out that amendments 3 and 5 will be replaced by new amendments which modify point 18 of the preamble and articles 5, 6 and 7 in order to adapt the text we are presenting to the wording drawn up by the Socrates Conciliation Committee and which will lead to a parallel solution for the committees in the majority of programmes."
"It is therefore the wording which has to be adapted and we hope that Parliament will do so suitably."
"I would ask you to vote unanimously for this programme, since it is of enormous importance."
"And we hope that by approving this second reading with the amendments presented, if the Commission and the Council accepts them, the programme may be approved, avoiding conciliation."
"I do not wish to end my intervention without mentioning the first rapporteur of this report, Mrs Benassar."
"When she left Parliament, with the beginning of the new mandate on 15 June, I was appointed rapporteur and I continued with the work which she had carried out."
"I continued with her efforts and have tried to work on this essential action which the Commission must take - the defence of women, young people and children - in order to prevent the violence which, unfortunately, is regularly directed at them."
"Mr President, we are talking today about the Daphne programme on measures to fight violence against children, young persons and women."
"A decision is urgently needed on this programme, in order to ensure continuity when the present period of support comes to an end."
"This is an important programme which complies with our commitment to achieve a high level of health protection in the European Union. I say this because we unfortunately still come across the effects of violence in our society all too often, and they represent a serious health risk."
"This is not just a question - and let me stress that I would like to see that little word ""just"" in quotation marks - of physical and sexual forms of violence."
"Protection against psychological violence, which occurs in many more different shapes and forms, and against which victims are even less well equipped to defend themselves, belongs in the Daphne programme."
"You cannot define health solely in terms of physical well-being."
"Every form of violence leaves a legacy of psychological damage which can only be repaired in rare cases or with difficulty."
"We need to set up new networks here and to support existing ones."
"However, it is equally important to support appropriate information campaigns, and in this case exchanges of experience play a big part."
"These exchanges need to extend to criminal prosecution, where discrimination against the victim must be avoided when charges are brought."
"It is important to give victims adequate information about their rights, and society must be made more sensitive in dealing with crimes of violence against women, children and young people."
"Children and young people need our special protection, and unfortunately this still applies to women too. Only when well-being has been attained in all social structures in our society will we be able to solve the problems of the future."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Avilés Perea very much for her swift and competent work, which she did so quickly despite the changeover, so that this urgently needed report is before us now."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Avilés on getting to grips with this difficult subject so rapidly, which meant that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have been able to present this report very quickly."
"Nevertheless, I would have liked to see more men involved in this work."
"Violence against women and children is after all a men' s problem, not a women' s problem."
"I am convinced that with this programme we have taken a big step forward in combating physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young persons and women."
"However, we all need to be aware that it is only one step, and that there is still a lot to be done to effectively combat this phenomenon of violence."
"In 1999 this House succeeded, in the face of persistent opposition, in initiating a campaign to counter violence against women."
"The Eurobarometer poll published this May made the extent of violence clear and identified the gaps where we need to take action."
"Europol and the STOP programme are instruments for combating trade in women."
"The Member States have committed themselves to do a great deal, which has, for instance, emerged from the campaigns."
"The complex interrelationships in the fight against violence have only really become clear because of the Austrian, German and Finnish Presidencies' Conferences."
"My own country, for example, has as a result set up a national action plan against violence, and other countries are following suit."
"I think that we have given an important impetus to this."
"Mrs Avilés' report on the common position was adopted after a great battle about changing the legal basis from Article 235 to Article 152, with the codecision procedure."
"But my own group only voted for it with great reservations and only because the World Heath Organisation definition, according to which health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, is now evidently recognised and taken as a basis by the Council."
"My group would have liked to see certain other changes of emphasis in the Daphne programme, for example links with other Community programmes such as PHARE, TACIS and MEDA,because that is where the big money is, in order to initiate preventive measures and campaigns in the applicant countries. However, as regards reaching agreement quickly and avoiding the conciliation procedure, we agree with Mrs Avilés here, and are only recommending six amendments to the common position."
"In any case we recommend that the media should be involved in order to get the programme up and running."
"I would like to thank you very sincerely for your work and hope that the Council will accept our amendments."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Avilés Perea for her thorough work."
"She has resubmitted a number of amendments that will receive our Group' s full backing, especially the definition of health."
"This is an enormous improvement to my mind."
"Many people, men but also women, still think that violence against women has become a rare occurrence within the European Union."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"One in five women within the European Union has been a victim of such violence at some time, including in our immediate surroundings."
"One does not have to look far."
"There are probably more victims but they never reported the crimes to the police or relief centres."
"In fact, most incidents of violence occur in the home, which means the phenomenon is less visible."
"Many women still want to keep their dirty laundry inside."
"They feel ashamed."
"The link between violence within the family and child protection is often overlooked."
"For example, if the court allows contact between the violent partner or ex-partners and their children, then the woman will remain exposed to violence via the children."
"I would once again draw attention to this fact."
"The specific aim of the Daphne programme is to encourage and support non-governmental organisations and other institutions to combat all kinds of violence against children and women."
"I welcome the fact that national measures are to be lent added value."
"Great!"
"Liberals do not wish to harmonise Member State legislation on violence against women and children."
"My group, however, is of the opinion that the Member States that are behind in this respect should be encouraged to bring their legislation up-to-date."
"I also think that the perspective should be shifted."
"Instead of trying to change the behaviour of women, the behaviour and attitude of men should be examined."
"This is not about short skirts, Mr President."
"Awareness and information campaigns on violence against women are desperately needed."
"This issue should, as far as I am concerned, feature high on the political agenda."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Avilés Perea on her work."
"The Daphne programme, we should remember, was an initiative of this Parliament in 1997 which recognised the need for action to combat violence against women, young people and children."
"In the first year of the programme alone 428 projects were submitted by various organisations in Europe and this level of response reflected the need for programmes such as this."
"In my own constituency I have seen the work of organisations like Welsh Women' s Aid which provides support, advice and practical refuge for women and children victims of violence."
"It receives over 15,000 calls a year and the number is rising all the time."
"Last year it housed over 2,000 women and over 3,000 children in refuges and they had to turn many others away because of the lack of accommodation."
"This workload reflects the scale of the problem we have throughout Europe."
"It also shows how important the role of NGOs and voluntary organisations is in this area."
"There are specific examples of the way in which Daphne-funded projects have helped."
"In just a few weeks' time an international seminar will take place in Leeds to look at issues of violence against women in conflict situations."
"Speakers from many countries will be attending that seminar."
"There have been many other projects linked to the important fight against child sex tourism which have been funded by Daphne."
"On the issue of the legal base - this is a health issue of course, but it is also far more than that."
"However, we can accept the World Health Organisation' s definition of health as not just being the absence of disease but a state of physical, mental and social well-being."
"Any lesser definition would leave much of the problem unexposed and we hope that this will be agreed as the European definition for the purpose of this programme."
"The Daphne programme, as others have said, has made a great deal of difference but there is a lot more to be done and it is vital that it is followed up."
"I trust that the Council will decide on this before 1 January so that existing projects can continue."
"Mr President, seeing the Daphne programme come up for renewal is a happy moment indeed."
"MEPs' determination, from 1996, along with the report by Marianne Eriksson through to today' s report by Maria Antonia Avilés Perea have all enabled violence towards children, young persons and women to become the object of political action."
"In speaking of politics, I choose my words carefully, because this violence is quite unacceptable in the view of countries that have taken the principle of human rights as their basis for fifty years."
"Please allow me then to emphasise the dignity of the victims of violence and the need to ensure that the health of these victims is understood to be both their mental and physical wellbeing."
"I think that prevention is the appropriate word."
"If we look at the issue in its totality, which is a question of taking action on the causes as well as the consequences, then it is obviously a political one in the sense that we would like the causes of violence, most often inflicted by men - and like Mrs Gröner, I deplore the fact that there are so few men present here in the Chamber this evening - to be studied and combated in the framework of the forthcoming programme."
"In the same way, we hope that by taking into account the consequences of violence and the effectiveness of a remedy and more besides, the aim will be to end this violence."
"This is why we must give full scope to this programme, both in terms of children on the one hand and of women on the other."
"These are two categories of victims that it is important to be able to distinguish between."
"Europe must establish a Children' s Rights day, following the example of France, and which the European Parliament has been requesting for some time."
"Are we not celebrating the tenth anniversary of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child today?"
"This is also why the dignity of women must not be subject to any ambiguity."
"If the term ""sexual exploitation"" indeed describes the trade involving another person' s body, then there is no good trade, neither trafficking in human beings nor prostitution."
"The States cannot, as States, accept, let alone organise or even encourage the trade in women."
"The awareness of rape for example is quite recent, as it was so recently still considered to be at worst a misdemeanour, whereas today, we know that it is in fact a crime."
"Awareness has come recently but I am delighted that violence towards children and women is no longer taboo."
"While this programme has an experimental value, we should understand it to be something powerful, to be a model, and not only as an ad hoc experiment for Europe' s forthcoming enlargement, but as the responsibility of a democratic Europe towards the whole world."
"To my mind, we are committed to our responsibility as Europeans."
"I would like to see the new Daphne programme applied as quickly as possible and if possible, with greater resources of time and finances."
"But I also hope that, beyond a health-based approach, we see that it is a question of people' s fundamental rights; I hope that this programme is guided by the objective of fighting all violence directed at women and children."
"Mr President, the Daphne programme' s great mission is to raise public awareness, to ensure that there is an exchange of information, to try, in this way, to protect children, young people and women from all those situations of break-up and despair."
"Underlying the texts of the recitals, there are the broken personal destinies of children and women who suffer physical violence, but also, and more insidiously, mental harassment."
"This issue concerns Europeans' physical and mental health."
"Direct or indirect violence towards anyone considered weak must be unequivocally condemned."
"Personally, I have the impression that violence is on show between couples, in families, at work, on television or even in political and social life."
"Perversion, aggression, and predatory behaviour hold more fascination for us and we pay too little attention to the victims of the law of the jungle that prevails in today' s world."
"Our age has refused to establish standards."
"It tolerates perversion because setting a limit today means an attempt to censure."
"We have lost our moral or religious boundaries and we are not able to become indignant unless the facts are visible, such as bruises on a face, or unless they come into the public domain, relayed by the media."
"Therefore we need information campaigns, and the Daphne programme will support these."
"Violence takes place in a world without borders and is not something from distant, barbaric times."
"We are in 1999, in this Chamber in Strasbourg and we are discussing violence perpetrated against women and children in Europe."
"We are not in some mythical, cruel and obscurantist Middle Ages but on the threshold of the 21st century."
"I firmly support the establishment of the Daphne programme; indeed we must support any initiative that aims to make this dark side of our society visible, as borders disappear in the face of all sorts of evil networks: prostitution, paedophilia and others, on the Internet for example."
"Our States must therefore collaborate and exchange information."
"The European Union can provide added value to the action of its Members."
"But it is also incumbent on our States to protect these women and children and anyone harmed by society."
"The State knows its citizens because it knows their mentality, the culture that they have in their mind and in their society that it has, to some extent, moulded."
"It is up to the national States themselves to promote the family as a support structure and to create men liberated from these patterns of violence that they pass down from generation to generation."
"Mr President, in my intervention I would like to stress the fundamental role played by the European Parliament, and in particular, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, in, I hope, reaching the point where the final adoption of this programme will be debated."
"It has already been mentioned in other interventions that, a few years ago, the European Parliament promoted pilot projects supporting non-governmental organisations and local authorities that, for some time, have been endeavouring to use actions to fight violence against women and children."
"This phenomenon of violence against women and children is, unfortunately, not only very widespread but is increasing, and is gradually taking on new, even more sophisticated forms, which are therefore more difficult to combat."
"The programme we are debating today is the result of this previous work."
"A very thorough discussion took place with the Executive Commission, especially with regard to amending the legal basis and therefore making the adjustments implied in the proposal to the original proposal."
"I do not wish to return to this topic, but I would like, however, to express a certain amount of satisfaction, despite the change to the legal basis, that the Commission and the Council have in any case adopted some elements which are extremely important to us."
"I am referring to the fact that the common position contains references to health in terms of physical, mental and social well-being, to quality of life and to violence as a violation of human rights, and, in particular, to the fact that this programme also covers victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation."
"I also find it especially significant that there is recognition of the important role played by the NGOs and multidisciplinary networks as well as public bodies who are already carrying out valuable work, in particular with regard to the prevention of violence and the support and protection of victims."
"To give this programme real added value, we must launch a major awareness campaign involving Parliament and the Commission, but, above all, the Member States, which must take complete responsibility for fighting violence."
"Mr President, of course I have nothing against part of the budget being dedicated to preventive measures against violence towards children, young people and women, as long as it is dedicated to providing financial help to organisations working at grassroots level."
"However, I think that the amount proposed is laughable and the Council' s desire to reduce it even further, shocking."
"The European Parliament and the Council are easing their conscience on the cheap because, besides domestic violence and violence connected to sexual exploitation, we should also acknowledge the growth of social violence which results from the increase in poverty and from the growing destitution amongst the working classes."
"The greatest act of violence is the serious effect of unemployment, but also the deterioration in the working conditions of those who still have a job."
"Is it not an act of violence for example, to force women, mothers, to work on production lines at night in order to make the machines more profitable and to provide greater profits for shareholders?"
"Now, not only do the European institutions tolerate such violence, but they have even made it worse by removing measures in the social legislation of some countries which gave some protection to women."
"And the mollifying speeches of the Daphne programme do not compensate for the rest."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Avilés Perea, I would also like to pay tribute to Francisca Bennasar Tous, who worked very hard in the last legislature to ensure the success of this programme."
"The European Parliament, and, particularly, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, have played a vitally important role in placing the issue of violence against women and children firmly on the European agenda."
"As the legal basis has now changed, we now face a codecision procedure on public health, because violence is really a physical and mental act that affects all social classes."
"Parliament firmly supports the definition of ""health"" made by the World Health Organisation and so, for us, health can be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not just the absence of disease."
"The actions of the Daphne programme must still be supported by NGOs, and, as we ourselves have proposed in our amendments, by social communication, as women, who are some of Europe' s most sceptical citizens where the European Union is concerned, must be made aware and understand that programmes such as Daphne exist and that they are of direct concern to women."
"In Portugal, for example, violence against women is statistically higher in areas which have a higher standard of living or higher levels of education, which does not necessarily mean that that is where more violence against women and children occurs."
"What it means - to my mind - is that there are more women in those areas who are financially independent, better educated and braver about making a complaint to the police."
"One of the practical measures taken in Portugal, at least in urban areas, was to have women police officers deal with women making complaints, and that immediately made a huge difference."
"Finally, I would like to take advantage of the fact that Commissioner António Vitorino, who attended the Tampere Summit, is here, to ask him to tell us how the Council' s final decision, which we applaud, to criminalise violence against human beings, particularly against women and children, will be put into practice."
"What it is going to change, Commissioner, and how?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Avilés Perea for this report, because with it she has provided us with another instrument to combat violence against women and children, and also, above all, to identify how and where violence occurs."
"The term violence is defined more precisely here, as violence can mean any type of exercise or abuse of power, injury or duress."
"All forms of violence should be rejected, but all too often there is a very high level of tolerance amongst families regarding violence."
"Violence against women should therefore be identified more actively, so that help can be provided."
"We also know that acts of violence increase if no sanctions are taken."
"It is difficult for victims to escape from violent relationships without outside help."
"The women and children affected need active support, and above all protection."
"It is society' s job - everybody' s job - to make available the best possible support measuresand protection instruments."
"Daphne is a support measure that makes it possible for us to combat this."
"However, legal measures will also be needed in individual countries."
"Let me take Austria as an example."
"Austria has been in the vanguard with a law providing protection against violence in force since 1997. This is known as the expulsion law, and under it violent men can be expelled and women can no longer be forced to flee with their children to women' s refuges and other similar establishments."
"The expulsion law initially applies for seven days and can if necessary be extended up to the divorce date."
"I would now like to invite other countries also to adopt a law of this kind, as it would help to ensure that women and their dignity are protected."
"Mr President, the Commission is delighted to take part in what is now the final step in the adoption of the Daphne Programme 2000-2003, a four-year Community action programme based upon the experience of the Daphne initiative established when the European Parliament included for the first time funds in the 1997 budget to combat violence against children, young persons and women."
"The programme rests firmly upon the recognition of the need to uphold human rights whether those of children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 or those of women as expressed in the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action in 1995."
"The Commission' s first proposal was made in May 1998 and during the last 18 months the procedure has survived not merely a change of legal base but also a change of Treaty, a change of commitology, a change of Parliament and a change of Commission."
"It is, clearly, therefore, a hardy plant designed to thrive and grow as a potent weapon in the Community' s armoury against the evil of violence inflicted upon those most at risk in our society."
"I would like to pay particular tribute to the parliamentary rapporteurs, Madame Bennasar Tous and Madame Avilés Perea for the work during the adoption procedure."
"They have led the parliamentary side in often difficult negotiations."
"I would also pay tribute to the work of the German and Finnish Presidencies without whose help we could not have achieved the second reading today in time for the programme to be adopted by 1 January next year."
"Finally, I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mrs Gradin, who throughout handled the Daphne dossier with great skill and expertise."
"The Daphne Programme builds on the Daphne initiative, but with two important changes."
"First, it is open for the applicant and EFTA countries to take part in the programme."
"These will significantly help the victims of cross-border trafficking of women and children."
"Secondly, the programme is now open to applications from other organisations than the NGOs."
"In the light of the different traditions within the Member States these changes will I hope greatly increase its effectiveness."
"The Commission accepts all the six amendments which are before the House today."
"We therefore hope that the Daphne programme will be adopted as speedily as possible."
"Once it has been adopted, the Commission will work with Parliament and the Member States to ensure that it achieves its goal."
"The Commission will specifically ensure that this programme is a relevant tool to channel the synergies of public authorities and NGOs in order to preserve the physical and psychological integrity and the social well-being of children, young persons and women in all areas of activity."
"I consider that coupling this initiative with the perspective opened by Tampere will lead in the near future to common definitions, common penal procedures and common sanctions that will be applied by Member States to the crimes of trafficking in human beings and to crimes against children."
"The goals are therefore to establish networks throughout the European Union and within the applicant countries between organisations active in the fight against violence against women and children that know the field and to raise awareness among the European public as a whole of the nature of this evil and of the need and the means to eradicate it."
"On the eve of the new millennium I may say, Mr President, that strong support in the European Parliament for this programme will be the best and clearest sign that the Union attaches the utmost political priority to effectively combating violence against children, young persons and women."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Rights of the Child"
"The next item is the Commission' s statement on the tenth anniversary of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"I shall now give the floor to Mr Vitorino to speak on behalf of the Commission."
"I am sure that the issue that has been raised today merits detailed consideration by the Commission and by the Union as a whole."
"As we have just seen from the previous debate, the Commission is already active in several fields involving children, though competence for action in the majority of relevant areas concerning children remains with the Member States."
"Children constitute a particularly vulnerable group."
"For example, for a number of years the Community has been providing support to countries in which there is a particular problem with regard to the economic exploitation, abandonment and prostitution of children through special projects aimed at fostering social assistance, protection, well-being, reintegration and education."
"In 1999 to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, dramatic priority was given to children' s rights under the European initiative for democracy and human rights, Chapter B.7-7 of the European Union budget."
"The Commission is already implementing the Daphne Initiative to combat violence against young persons and children, and this will be succeeded next year, as we have just seen from the previous debate, by the Daphne Programme 2000-2003."
"Through the STOP programme and through its work in the fields of police and judicial cooperation, the Commission is actively fighting the sexual exploitation of children including child pornography on the Internet."
"In the field of police cooperation and of the third pillar, the Commission now has the power of joint initiative with the Member States and is actively pursuing the fight against the sexual exploitation of children."
"In January a codecision was adopted establishing an action plan to promote the safer use of the Internet thereby protecting children from violence and pornography."
"It followed a recommendation in 1998 on the protection of minors and human dignity."
"The Commission is now implementing these measures."
"In May the Commission adopted a communication on the implementation of measures to combat child sex tourism and it has now selected a number of actions to be co-financed in this field."
"The Commission is also undertaking action in the social field and the educational field with a view to improving the quality of life of children and opportunities for their development and education."
"The suggestion that sometimes has been put forward to establish a children's unit within the Commission is one that I recognise will require study in particular to ensure that full account is taken of the human and financial resources that are at present available."
"The Commission will also give consideration as to the idea of publishing a communication on children to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention."
"This will clearly take a little time."
"I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter in the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"The Commission will study attentively the reports of this debate and will take all appropriate action to meet the concerns of the Parliament in order not only to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Convention but also to improve concrete policies in order to achieve the goals set by this Convention."
"Mr President, firstly I should just like to make a technical point."
"The debate we have here today, which is very welcome, has been part of a long, difficult technical process."
"First of all we thought we would have a proper resolution and then an oral question; in fact a great many Members signed an oral question."
"I would hope that their names can be added to whatever resolution comes out of today' s debate."
"We went to a lot of trouble to get colleagues to sign this."
"I hope that their names will also be listed in the agenda."
"I thank the Commissioner for his statement: ""We demand that the EU listen carefully to the voices of its 90 million children and young people under eighteen."
"We are concerned that the way in which Europe is developing creates real risks for the safety, protection and wellbeing of its young citizens."
"Twenty percent of Europe' s children live in poverty despite the countries of the EU being amongst the richest in the world."""
"These are not my words but the words of children and young people from my country, Ireland, and other EU countries."
"They put it better than I can, how children are excluded from EU policy and how laws and policies that the EU makes have a very real impact on children' s lives, an impact that is different from that on adults."
"Children have a very low priority at European level."
"The only really serious political response came following the horrific Dutroux affair in Belgium when MEPs were queuing up to sign my resolution on that tragedy."
"Even then the EU' s institutional response has been largely focused on the issue of sexual abuse and trafficking and not on the wider set of EU issues that affect children."
"The lack of a clear legal base in the Treaty has meant that children' s specific needs are ignored."
"This week the world celebrates the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"This is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world and the most comprehensive legal statement of children' s rights world-wide."
"Except the US and Somalia, all countries in the world have ratified the Convention; but despite the fact that the EU Member States have ratified it too, the EU institutions themselves have so far failed to implement it."
"We have an absurd situation in which Member States have to promote the best interests of the child in legislation and policy, but the Union is under no legal obligation to protect children' s best interests."
"At present children are invisible in EU legislation."
"Single market considerations often override children' s best interests."
"For example, protection of children and children' s safety may be compromised by lack of regulation of services such as Internet and TV advertising."
"Children are seen as burdens, dependants, victims or barriers to work in direct contradiction to their status in the Convention."
"The strong focus on the citizen as worker in the Treaty means that the best interests of children are not considered."
"Children are only a target group in one action programme and very few temporary budget lines."
"Children and children' s projects receive less than EUR 5 million directly from the EU' s vast budget."
"Since the disappearance of the children and family budget line in DG V there is no budget line which has children as a general target group."
"Children have become invisible in EU policy."
"Most fundamentally, there is no coordination and no unit of the Commission, no Directorate-General which takes a lead in developing a coherent, overall policy on children."
"I am glad to hear you say you are considering it, Commissioner."
"We look forward to rapid action on this matter."
"I would like to make the following recommendations to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention."
"The Commission should adopt a communication on children' s rights to mark the tenth anniversary of the Convention and create a children' s policy unit."
"Member States, at the next revision of the Treaties, must adopt a clear legal base on the EU Treaties to promote the best interests of the child."
"Parliament should ensure that children are more visible in budget lines and the Commission should improve its technique and develop mechanisms for dialogue with the NGOs representing children."
"Mr President, on 20 November 1989 the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted, and I think that the tenth anniversary of that event is a good opportunity to take stock."
"Our Member States did indeed ratify the convention, even if in some cases it was with certain reservations, and they should now be removed as a matter of urgency."
"We Social Democrats have over the last ten years worked hard to secure a better hearing for children' s rights, and have emphasised these rights with various important reports and resolutions."
"This goes back to the Gröner report in 1991, in which Parliament for the first time dealt with children' s problems, and in which I was already demanding a children' s ombudsperson."
"I should also mention the Bandres Molet report on a European charter for children' s rights and last year' s Zimmermann report on minors."
"We have also given a very high level of political priority to children' s needs in various reports to the UN world conferences, in conjunction with third countries, and in particular with the ACP countries."
"In the course of this year, Parliament has submitted a succession of proposals to the Commission, and it now expects the Commission to produce a communication in which all these initiatives are brought together."
"The various tasks on the list of priorities should be tackled one by one."
"Right at the top of the list is the incorporation of fundamental children' s rights into the new treaty."
"Secondly, using the Daphne programme as a first step, as the first instrument for taking action to counter sexual exploitation and violence against children."
"Thirdly, there is the situation of girls and young women, which merits special attention in all areas of policy, as they are still exposed to particular discrimination not only here in Europe, but all over the world."
"Fourthly, we must do everything we can to ensure that children are not involved in wars, either as victims or aggressors."
"We do not want to see any more child soldiers anywhere in the world."
"Two minutes is very short and the list of tasks is a long one."
"Please take some action!"
"Mr President, as previous speakers have indicated, allowing this convention to become a powerful and important tool for the European Union is the best way of celebrating it, when it comes to both domestic and foreign policy."
"We must do everything to ensure that the countries with which we are cooperating honour their obligations under the convention."
"We know, as a lot of people here have mentioned, that many countries have ratified it."
"But how many countries are there really which honour their obligations, for example to report on what they have done."
"We must make sure that the convention is an important tool in relation to the candidate countries."
"I think that a step forward was taken when children' s rights were specified in the progress report on Romania."
"As we know, conditions were in that way established for negotiations with Romania."
"In the statement which most of us are looking forward to and which Commissioner Vitorino mentioned, we must also find out how much the European Union is spending on children under the PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"Hans van den Broek was promising for a time that we should obtain such a report, but it has not been forthcoming."
"I look forward to its arriving no later than with the statements."
"Mrs Gröner mentioned child soldiers."
"I think that is the most topical of the questions concerning children' s rights."
"We must support all those who are working for the voluntary protocol, which will begin to be drawn up next year."
"We must make sure that countries which sanction child soldiers really are not given the same advantages."
"I am sorry that this Parliament could not have given the Sakharov prize to a woman who has fought against the employment of child soldiers."
"I think it is particularly important that, not only before but also after the Tampere Summit, we investigate - under the third pillar - how children are treated and ensure that child refugees receive special treatment."
"Mr President, I would agree with much of what we have heard already in the debate this evening."
"I, like many others here, will remember the enthusiasm and political excitement with which this convention was adopted, how many world leaders were keen to be seen with young people and to talk in glowing terms of the future they were offering."
"I reflect with considerable sorrow at the dying-away of many of those fine words."
"One of the main concerns of that convention is the right for children to live in peace."
"People have already referred to some 300,000 under-18 year olds recruited as soldiers throughout the world."
"Some of them are in our own Member States where they have no right to vote for the governments which decide their futures."
"We see many children working in conditions of slavery and forced labour and we would urge all European Union states to ratify the ILO Convention dealing with these issues."
"We would also urge Members States at the next IGC, to adopt a legal base to promote and protect the rights of the child as defined in the United Nations Convention."
"We also need to take responsibility for the state of the world in which those children are growing up, not least the environmental conditions under which many of them have to suffer."
"It is essential that we meet and surpass the targets that we have set ourselves to combat such things as climate change."
"For far too many children, clean water, safe food and adequate shelter are still a dream, even for many in the so-called developing world."
"We would also argue that we need to change the priorities of our international financial institutions so that priority may be given to safeguarding the environment and providing health care and education rather than open markets."
"Lastly, cancelling the debt of the world' s poorest countries would also help the young people of those nations considerably."
"Mr President, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of this Convention, a text which recognises the child as an individual in its own right, by giving it its own rights (the right to life, the right to identity and to a family, the right of expression and the right to be fed and educated) it is nevertheless still true that on our continent every thirty seconds, a child is abused, raped or beaten up, is indoctrinated, and is the victim of inadequate policies, changes in family and financial circumstances, a victim too of the fact that we are not applying this international Convention."
"It is therefore our duty, at the end of the century to ask ourselves why there are millions of children who are forced into prostitution, who kill themselves, who take drugs, and as our continent is only just beginning to discover the terrible effects of paedophilia, to which we have closed our eyes for such a long time, we must ask ourselves why, in our countries which are developed in terms of democracy and economics, which proudly celebrate the Declaration on Human Rights every year, these rights are flouted when the most vulnerable in our society, that is children, are concerned."
"With this in mind, Commissioner, we hope that our children will become much more visible."
"During the last Parliamentary term, I tabled a report on behalf of Parliament on the protection of children and the family in which I asked for a visible budget for our children and for the creation, within the Commission, of a special unit responsible for protecting children and the family."
"In it I also highlighted the need to bring together, at our own behest, an extraordinary European Council on the future of policies on the family and on protecting children in the Union and to present an annual report to Parliament comparing legislation on this issue in our respective countries."
"Finally, we hope, and I too hope, like many of my fellow MEPs, that we can contemplate, within the framework of the IGC, the introduction of an indisputable legal basis for actions favouring children and the family."
"Whereas in 2001 a report will be made at the UN of the first World Summit on Children, I suggest that within our own Parliament, we create a European Children' s Parliament, established together with them, to celebrate this European World Summit in 2001."
"Mr President, Commissioner, every time children' s rights are not respected, an act of violence is committed."
"Even if collective violence happens to be the most visible, daily acts of violence and problems between neighbours, which we might call small acts of violence, are very hard to bear for those who suffer them and it is in this climate that some children are born and grow up today."
"Violence is indicative of social problems that must be urgently addressed."
"Instead of corrective or repressive solutions, priority should be given to preventive solutions, creating a different kind of family setting, which would finally enable us to prevent pointless suffering on a personal and on a social scale and to practise a genuine policy of inclusion and socialisation from birth onwards."
"The important thing is not to try to draw up a catalogue of rights, but to make everyone aware of the importance of early childhood, in order to avoid a future society where, because they were denied their rights when children, young people' s only means of expressing themselves is to rebel."
"Humans are born helpless and in a state of dependence."
"Babies have nothing but their rights."
"They can have no obligations."
"Obligations come only with awareness, and awareness is only stimulated by means of education and there can be no successful education without respect for the baby' s dignity and for that of the child."
"We must support children' s rights in third countries, but also in our own States."
"We must also start to collectively think about children' s living conditions in the various European countries particularly in urban areas, and initiate a form of collaboration as well as financial resources in order to help families in difficulty, particularly in the case of single-parent families or of vulnerable parents."
"Our goal is nothing less than to have well-balanced children."
"It is therefore our duty to protect and educate them."
"Mr President, this year' s tenth anniversary of the UN Convention is a very good opportunity for both the European Parliament and the Commission not just to deliver speeches in celebration of the anniversary but above all to press for further action, to make more resources available, and to take initiatives and measures to coordinate an integrated and binding policy which will prove effective in protecting human values and the human dignity of children."
"Recent UNICEF statistics paint a gloomy picture of world reality."
"Millions of children are suffering from hunger and a lack of basic medical care and education, whilst some 300,000 children under the age of 18 are currently being trained for and are taking part in military operations."
"And whilst all this is happening in the underdeveloped world, in the civilised West violence against children, abandonment and the sexual exploitation of children through international networks is assuming terrifying dimensions."
"That is why the European Parliament needs to send a strong message to all the institutional bodies of the European Union, to international organisations and to governmental organisations telling them that we must put an end to this scourge."
"In light of the drawing up of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, we must incorporate a separate chapter on the protection of the rights of the child."
"Mr President, never before in history were humanitarian rights so well developed."
"Never before have there been so many international treaties ratified by so many states."
"Despite this, human rights are still being systematically violated on a large scale."
"This also applies to children' s rights."
"Nearly all countries have now ratified the treaty."
"Although good progress has been made in certain areas, other forms of abuse against children are on the increase."
"Over the past decade, the number of children on the streets has grown at an alarming rate."
"Commercial sexual exploitation of children has become more international and more organised."
"Children are more than ever the victim of wars."
"It is estimated that since 1987, two million children have been killed in armed conflict."
"Six million have been maimed for life."
"Nearly 30 million are currently on the run from war and violence."
"Treaties on their own do not suffice."
"They also need to be implemented."
"More mechanisms should therefore come into place in order to actually enforce these rights, more monitoring bodies to ensure that they are observed and more pressure tools for sentencing perpetrators."
"We have already mentioned one of the cruellest forms of child abuse: child soldiers."
"In fact, over the past two years, 300,000 children under the age of 18 have fought in conflicts all over the world, many of whom were recruited under duress."
"Invariably, greater numbers of children than adults are killed due to a lack of experience and training."
"Drafting in child soldiers not only threatens to lead to a criminalisation of society, it also turns all children into potential targets."
"Mr President, we need more than fine-sounding declarations of intent."
"As Parliament, we need to advocate the introduction of a minimum age of 18 for recruitment and taking part in armed conflict."
"Presenting a united front on this, linking all European Member States without exception, will be more than a symbolic step in the direction of a more child-friendly society."
"Mr President, many tragedies there are in the world but none more moving than those that affect children."
"There are none worse than the ones we have heard about today involving trades in children."
"I want to refer to one of those trades and that is the trade that takes place in adoption."
"In the United Kingdom, in the 1960s, we had some 25,000 adoptions, with 12,500 under one-year-olds."
"In the 1970s that figure had fallen to 13,000 and the under one-year-olds to 3,000."
"By the 1990s that had dropped again to 7,000 with only 900 under one-year-olds."
"Much of the differences stem of course from the wider and freer availability of abortion."
"In Britain the figure is one in five pregnancies, in London it is one in three."
"More children who are available for adoption have disabilities - mental or physical or behavioural problems - and so couples, not surprisingly, look further afield for babies to adopt."
"And further afield, indeed, there are babies available for adoption."
"The first duty for all of us should be to the child."
"For any child that needs a family, the preference is for its own family and if that is not available then a family in its own community."
"If that is not available then a family, perhaps with a different background, within its own country. If that is not available, then, and only then, should one start looking for a home abroad."
"But it must be a properly vetted and loving home and the couple taking on the responsibility for that child must show an understanding of the child's background."
"Too often we have seen abuses in the system which puts couples' wishes before the child's interests."
"So we have seen rackets developing in baby-selling, mothers having their babies stolen, mothers being bribed to part with their children, mothers being conned that the child is going to benefit from a good start in life and return to the family when, of course, there is no such intention."
"That is why we have the Hague Convention on Inter-Country Adoption."
"That is why I ask the Commission to make sure that Hague Convention is properly implemented throughout the European Union nations."
"I ask for a report to be brought forward to show the state of law in each member country and the state of legal practice."
"On this, the tenth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we must stand up for those children, for their rights to be children."
"That means supporting children in need because of illness, or disability or hunger or poverty or lack of educational opportunities."
"It means an end to child labour and exploitation and the awful trades in children."
"So much of that is caused by the cruelty or neglect of adults and the least adults can do is to ensure that when a child genuinely has no family we apply the provisions of the Inter-Country Convention when giving that child another chance in life through adoption."
". (FR) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all the speakers and to assure you that, on behalf of the Commission, I have noted your concerns and your wishes."
"I think, moreover, that we are facing a problem that can be seen from two different angles: on the one hand, from that of basic rights, and on the other, from that of the influence of children' s policies on the Union' s areas of action."
"With regards to the first angle, fundamental rights, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, we in the Union are committed to respecting fundamental rights, and specifically, the freedoms and fundamental human rights, in the way they have evolved in the constitutional traditions common to our Member States."
"I think that the appropriate forum for debating the opportunities to enshrine a fundamental right for children must be the same as for the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I would like to say, before Parliament, that I shall raise the issue there."
"With regard to sectoral policies, I still hold with the suggestion of a communication on this subject by the Commission which must, by definition, be horizontal."
"But I would also like to point out, before Parliament, that the Commission is already committed to developing specific measures concerning children."
"I must tell you all that in my own area of action, more specifically, police and judicial cooperation, that the fight against the trade in children, the fight against the abuse of children and other crimes against them, as well as the prevention of juvenile crime are just as much priorities for action by the Commission which we will be developing within the framework of programmes for police and judicial cooperation that I shall inform you of when I give the presentation of the scoreboard system requested by the Heads of State and Government."
"With regard to this opportunity for a horizontal communication by the Commission, I think that we can envisage therefore, its organisational consequences put forward in your suggestions: the creation of a unit within the Commission and the definition of budgets dedicated to the protection of children in order to improve public supervision of the Union' s participation as well as over policies of child protection."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the responsibility for applying the Convention rests above all with the Member States and that that is an area in which we are strictly bound to apply the principle of subsidiarity."
"But I would also like to think that we could envisage promoting, under the auspices of the Commission, a comparative study of the transposition of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into the national laws of several Member States."
"I think that this kind of study could help to identify the extent to which the Convention is actually being applied."
"I am a lawyer and I am very keen on laws and legal texts, but I am also a father, and I am especially keen on seeing moral, political and cultural rules being applied to protecting children."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Informing and consulting workers"
"The next item is Mr Rocard' s oral question (B5-0034/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on informing and consulting workers in the European Community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in April 1999, the European Parliament adopted at first reading its legislative resolution on the Commission proposal establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Union."
"The proposal for a directive establishes a framework which aims to remedy the gaps and counter the shortcomings of the national and Community legislation currently in force."
"The objectives of this proposal are the following: to ensure that the right to regular information and consultation of employees on economic and strategic developments in the firm and on the decisions which affect them exists in all Member States of the European Community; to consolidate social dialogue and relations of trust within the firm in order to assist risk anticipation, develop the flexibility of work organisation within a framework of security and enhance employees' awareness of the need to adapt, encouraging this; to include the situation and anticipated development of employment within the firm among the subjects of information and consultation; to ensure that workers are informed and consulted prior to decisions which are likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations; ensure the effectiveness of these procedures by introducing specific penalties for those who seriously violate their obligations in this field."
"In this regard, we have seen recently - judging by some debates held in this Chamber - how important it is to lay down a precise reference framework for information and consultation."
"This proposal will ensure minimum standards for information and consultation to be applied throughout the Community, by harmonising the fundamental rights of employees - these are already in place in many Member States - and helping to strengthen the European social dimension, which is what we are all aiming for."
"The European Parliament has adopted a series of amendments, aiming, in particular, to specify procedures and definitions for information and consultation, in particular as regards the moment at which information should be transmitted."
"We believe, however, that it is important for this to be carried out during the planning stage so as to allow employees to anticipate change, extending the Directive' s field of application and ensuring that it contains minimum provisions at Community level, derogations from which may be allowed only if they are more favourable to employees, as well as extending the content to the areas which directly affect the workers and their future."
"The Commission reacted positively to some amendments to our report and voiced reservations about others."
"Nevertheless - and here is the reason for this oral question - it still has not tabled a revised proposal that clearly states its position on Parliament' s amendments, and also - and I must say this with regret, in that we had expected the Finnish Presidency to take this issue into account - the Finnish Presidency has not shown the political will to continue with this dossier."
"The reason for this question is, in fact, to ask the Commission not just to express its position on Parliament' s proposals clearly, but, above all, to ask it for the procedures and time periods for the tabling of its own revised version on Parliament' s position."
"On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the question I would like to ask the Commissioner - who moreover, has displayed great sensitivity on these subjects in other circumstances - is the following: can you tell us what the conflicting aspects of the matter are and the reasons why a revised proposal has not yet been tabled?"
"Moreover, can you anticipate the proposal to be tabled before the end of the year?"
"But above all, what measures do you intend to adopt to facilitate a political agreement on the issue, an agreement which is of prime importance for the Commission, Council and Parliament to be able to take a final decision on this matter?"
"We consider this to be especially important, and besides, it is part of a more wide-ranging issue which is concerned with preparing and accompanying the changes underway in the labour market, so that they do not produce negative results, especially as far as employees' job security is concerned."
"Mr President, without a doubt the European Parliament plays an important role in many significant issues concerning social awareness, but it must be said that particularly here, Parliament has played a forceful role in this directive."
"Mr Ghilardotti described the facts."
"I should just like to make four basic points on the issue of the Community directive."
"This proposed Community directive is a framework which will enable us to adjust to industrial change."
"It is an essential political framework which will enable us to welcome this inevitable change in a socially acceptable way."
"In the last discussion we held in this Chamber on the Michelin case, I had said that such changes are by no means a smooth operation since we are living in an age of major restructuring, technological advances, changes in the work place, and expanding globalisation."
"We must therefore prepare ourselves to welcome this change at a social level."
"The next point I would like to make is that in this age of restructuring, Europe has been generally successful."
"It has the internal market, which is deepening day by day, and it has Monetary Union, which is widening day by day. Now, the time has come for Europe to prove its social dimension."
"Thus, this directive is indeed a very important political choice."
"It was proposed following some three years of dialogue in April with the social partners and in November 1998 it was proposed both in Parliament and in the Council."
"Parliament reacted with the resolution and the 35 amendments."
"A year on, however, the Council has not even considered this directive."
"As far as the amendments are concerned, the Commission accepts nine of them, seven of them are in principle acceptable, but we did not make further progress and I would like to explain why."
"Under the Finnish Presidency, which as you know is responsible for pushing forward directives and planning the six-month period, a strategy was announced in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"This strategy envisaged the first ballot on the European company statute directive to be followed by the ballot on the directive on consultation and information. Reasoning that if the directive we are discussing today were to come first, then the ballot on the employment directive, which as you all know has been on the table for discussion for more than 14 years now, would become extremely complicated."
"The Finnish Presidency' s strategy was for there to be a discussion on the issue of the European company statute."
"However, the directive we are discussing today did not make it to the negotiating table and I would like to reply to Ms Ghilardotti' s question regarding what issues are still controversial and what issues are still giving rise to disagreement among the national representatives."
"Firstly, the companies' personnel threshold should be higher than the one we have been discussing for consulting and informing."
"In my opinion, the issue of small and medium-sized businesses must be treated separately."
"The situation regarding small and medium-sized businesses is different, but of course, there must be a threshold higher than the one we have been discussing."
"The threshold of 50 people had been suggested."
"I repeat that this is a major topic of discussion and there have been many differences of opinion over it."
"The second issue concerns what is actually meant by the term 'consultation and information' ."
"There were some dissenting opinions which depended largely on the differing state of affairs in various Member States and, in many cases, on the political viewpoints we adopt."
"The third issue concerns the degree of self-reliance and the terms of agreement between the social partners in each Member Sate and how far they can go. The final issue is that of sanctions."
"Those issues are to a greater or lesser extent still open."
"The question at present is what we will have to do and how we will have to proceed in order to achieve the desired result."
"And the desired result is for us to be able to vote for such a directive as soon as possible."
"It is not important for us to have a particularly sound directive on the table for discussion."
"What is important is that we create the right framework with set preconditions and that it is voted for so that it can enter into force."
"So, what is the timetable and what does the Commission propose to do hereafter?"
"Firstly, we are awaiting the completion of the Finnish Presidency' s term of office and to see if there will be some final agreement on the issue concerning the European company statute."
"If there is no result at the end of the year, I intend to propose a new strategy to the Portuguese Presidency, a different approach to the issue and a different basis for negotiations so that we can make quicker headway with the directive in question, and, as soon as we have the Council' s initial reaction, proceed with this new approach which, in my view, is quite a straightforward one."
"It is not difficult for us to readjust the proposal based on the amendments accepted so far and then to refer this to the Council."
"I believe, however, that under the Portuguese Presidency we must adopt a very different approach from the largely unsuccessful one adopted under the existing Presidency, and proceed in the way I prescribed before."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in April the PPE Group voted for the legislative resolution on the directive on a European framework for informing and consulting workers in the Member States."
"Partnership and subsidiarity are the hallmark of the Parliament and Commission proposals."
"Companies should be provided with a tailor-made solution for informing and consulting workers, based on agreement between the two sides of industry."
"One of Parliament' s proposals is that existing national workers' organisations must be involved in drawing up this agreement."
"It would be unthinkable to have an agreement that local works councils had not been involved in shaping!"
"Although the Commission' s initial reaction to the various amendments was positive, they have not yet put forward an amended proposal, as you yourself have said."
"You cannot just put everything that was so carefully worked out in Parliament on ice!"
"It is high time that the right conditions for a Council common position were created."
"There is obviously a lack of political will in the Council."
"How does the Commission view the situation, Commissioner?"
"I did not entirely follow you."
"Does the Commission believe that the Finnish Presidency and possibly also the forthcoming Portuguese Presidency should be concerned that the United Kingdom, for example, might switch back to the opposition camp in the dispute over workers' participation rights in the European Company, which has not yet been created?"
"After all, it is an open secret that the British Government was only persuaded to support a European Company with minimum participation rights because of a promise to hold back on the directive on information and consultation for one year."
"When we have considered examples of company restructuring in this Chamber, we have often complained about management' s failure to provide information in good time, as with Hoover, Renault and Michelin."
"But we have some good news now."
"This relates to the success story of the directive on the European Works Council."
"For it to work well, national workers' organisations at local level should be able to forward their information to the European Works Council, and they should have sufficient rights to react in good time."
"This directive will ensure that."
"I would like to state my question even more clearly, Commissioner: was I right in understanding you to say that the Commission does not intend to present an amended proposal before the end of this year?"
"I would deeply regret that. Timely information for workers means transparency, which in turn creates confidence and avoids friction in European companies."
"Employers and employees stand to gain from this in equal measure."
"Mr President, I am not going to repeat what the previous speakers have said about the need for this directive."
"A few days ago, Commissioner, it was said on the subject of the Michelin debate that intelligent approaches to restructuring were required."
"I shall give you the example of the restructuring of a company of European dimensions which has a European works council, which is intelligent, but only in one respect."
"And this is exactly what we are trying to avoid: a lack of balance in social dialogue."
"All of Parliament' s amendments have been very significant, and one that I consider to be extremely relevant is the one that expresses the need for ethics and good faith on all sides."
"What happened, for example, with the restructuring at Ford in Portugal is a prime example of what happens when this good faith is missing."
"At the end of the 1980s, Ford in Portugal had twelve hundred employees."
"The company moved the factory to Poland and promised investment in that country in return for state tax and other incentives."
"That investment was never fully made in Poland. And Ford is now announcing the closure of both factories: in Poland and in Portugal."
"This kind of relocation and restructuring, Commissioner, is this century' s way of doing business."
"It has nothing to do with introducing new technology or with companies' needs to maintain productivity levels."
"According to Ford, they do not have problems with their productivity levels; on the contrary, they say that these two plants and their workers are enormously productive."
"And the result is that because these employees are so highly specialised they will only be able to find work as unskilled workers."
"We should be concerned by all of this social upheaval."
"It requires a response, it requires steering through, and it requires legislative measures and more besides!"
"It was high time that the Commission started monitoring companies of this size because it is not the companies of fifty or a hundred employees that are under threat."
"Let us begin, then, with companies of European dimensions, and let us begin by assessing what a necessary restructuring actually is."
"We in the European Parliament represent both sides of industry, and one of them has no voice of its own, Commissioner."
"It is crucial that we let it be heard."
"I sincerely hope that the Portuguese Presidency will provide a response to this and I shall use all my influence to this end."
"Mr President, I want to say that I too am sorry that the Commission has still not submitted a revised proposal on the subject of informing and consulting workers."
"Even if, after the election, a new and different majority is formed here in Parliament, we support this inquiry into the issue, even if there are some amendments which we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party value more than others; yes, even if there are aspects of the proposal we should definitely like to have done without."
"The political process should not be directed by delays."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party want to promote the cause of informing and consulting workers, but it is also important to us that the necessary respect should be shown for differences in traditions and culture in this area."
"No new bureaucratic systems should be established which are out of harmony with labour markets where there is at present an effective dialogue between the social partners."
"We attach particular importance to the fact that life should not- even with the best of intentions - be made more difficult for small and medium-sized businesses where, in the nature of things, management is close to the workers."
"The amendments which Parliament adopted at the first reading in April mean, among other things, that the regulations governing the consulting of workers will apply to businesses with 50 or more employees and that it will no longer be possible for individual nations to be exempt from these."
"We prefer the original proposal which makes it possible in certain circumstances to raise the limit to 100 employees."
"On the other hand, we can support the tone of the amendments which clearly points in the direction of making the directive a minimum directive with the Member States having the option to go further."
"As we say, we like some of the things in this proposal from Parliament, and some other things we like rather less. However, a delay in the decision process is something which we definitely cannot countenance."
"I think, however, that Mrs Diamantopoulou has provided a good explanation of the problems there are in implementing the proposal, and this shows in fact that there are real political problems."
"Commissioner, I come from a country where the boss of a multinational company, Michelin, decided to inform his shareholders first of his decision to make 10% of his employees in various countries redundant over the next three years."
"In the course of last month' s part-session, Commissioner, you stated, in a warm and convincing way, the Commission' s determination to protect employees' rights in terms of information and consultation about their future."
"We are delighted that you are determined to see this into the Portuguese Presidency."
"However, and contrary to what the previous speaker has just said, the Greens think that these rights should be extended to all companies that are not part of the small-business sector and we propose a minimum of twenty employees."
"If we adopted, as the Commission seems to want to do, a minimum of fifty employees, this would cause serious distortions of competition, affecting only 3% of European companies."
"One day we will have to go further."
"In several European countries, the participation of workers is something which society sets great store by."
"Participation in decision making and also participation in the results."
"The European Council did not want to follow Parliament' s advice on this matter."
"Today however, by means of pension funds, pensioners are participating more and more in companies' capital, in their management and in their profits."
"It would be paradoxical and would even threaten a war between the generations if current employees were to be excluded from this kind of participation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, during our debate on 27 October on the Michelin affair, I reminded all those present that Parliament had amended the directive on informing and consulting workers and that we were still waiting for the Commission to adopt these amendments."
"The two main amendments - I shall remind you of them - covered two points: firstly, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wanted the directive to apply to companies with twenty or more employees, and Parliament to companies of fifty employees or more, whereas the Commission is proposing the figure of one hundred or more, if I am not mistaken."
"On the other hand, the second major amendment stated that any withholding of information from the employees' representatives by a company' s management should be penalised, and not only the withholding of information that the management considers important (far too vague an idea)."
"What does the Commission have to say today about these two points?"
"Nothing new, and we will get back to that in the year 2000."
"Frankly, Commissioner, I do not think that we can do things this way."
"This wait-and-see policy is completely turning its back on the way society is waiting for an answer."
"We should not only listen to the message that was sent to us in the last elections, and adopt these two amendments, but I have also put forward additional proposals which strike me as being crucial today."
"I proposed the introduction of a waiting period of six months for any restructuring plan in order to allow an independent trade union review to take place, and I also proposed that if the company had received public subsidies but is not complying with the rules which have been laid down, it should pay back the subsidies it had received."
"I think that, now, you should present an amended draft directive, incorporating these further measures, this waiting period, and use your role to put pressure on the Council rather than falling in line as a measure of precaution with the lowest common denominator in our respective governments."
"I also expect, Commissioner, that Mr Prodi will include these references too in the programme that he will be presenting to us."
"Mr President, I would like to extend my warmest thanks to the Commissioner this evening for her promise."
"1 January 2000 is very close indeed, and a certain strategy has already been put in place by her predecessor for keeping an eye on what is happening as regards the European plc."
"It is clear that something needs to be done about this."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner has taken this so well."
"Indeed, I think, as far as this is concerned, that we must go further from 1 January onwards."
"I should also add that with this strategy, it has been the case before that we have lost sight of the fact that the European plc has to be voted on with unanimity, whilst this is a directive requiring majority voting."
"We may well speed up in the long run by putting this directive back on track, rather than continuing endlessly with the European plc."
"This may be an unnecessary consideration but I do think that we achieved our purpose tonight."
"We have made some progress."
"Mr President, of course it is not the Commissioner who is keeping a low profile - although they tried to play down the fact that nothing has been submitted yet, but that has now been addressed as far as I am concerned - rather it is the Council itself."
"Then we have to shift our attention to the somewhat mysterious Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Blair."
"Mr Blair who would very much like to join forces with Europe, yet is trying to stop Europe from bringing this issue to a satisfactory conclusion."
"This is the problem we are facing, Mr President."
"In all manner of ways, using traditional politburo tactics, attempts are even being made to thwart debate on this directive, that is people expressing their opinions as to the content."
"Surely, this is not something we should expect to happen."
"I can only say, Mr President, that the Blair administration and some other socialist governments are so frightened to admit how little they are prepared to do for the employee, that they cannot cope with this in debate, as they used to, but have to resort to all kinds of underhand politburo tactics."
"This must end and I am really pleased that this has been highlighted this evening in this debate in one way or another."
"Mr President, I could tell my good friend, Mr Pronk, that if he will have a word with Mr Aznar, I will have a word with Mr Blair."
"It is a majority proposal."
"We have problems with a number of governments."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for what she has said."
"I see now the sense in the strategy that she is adopting."
"I hope the delay in a revised proposal might lead to progress."
"I would say this, however: please bear in mind that if part of this strategy is that a new proposal is brought forward after the turn of the year that is substantially different to the first then we, Parliament, would need to be consulted from the beginning once again."
"Please bear that in mind."
"One argument in addition to the list of crunch points that you mentioned in your introduction that has been deployed by my own government and others is that of subsidiarity."
"It is not a very good argument in this particular area."
"In the ten years up to 1996, following the introduction of the Single Act, there was a tripling in the number of mergers and take-overs in both the service and manufacturing sectors."
"An interesting thing is that two-thirds of those mergers and take-overs were at national rather than transnational level."
"They were, however, directly related to the completion of the internal market."
"Therefore developments at Member State level are inextricably linked to the changes we have put in place at European level."
"That is one of the strongest arguments against subsidiarity - denying progress in this area."
"In the 1970s our governments, despite the unanimity rule, introduced a directive on transfers, one on collective redundancies and one on insolvency to try to bring about responsible restructuring following the oil shocks."
"It is absolutely dreadful that the Council now seems to be paralysed when it comes to this directive, to the worker involvement in the company statute and indeed the Commission in relation to a revision of the Works Council Directive."
"We need to get this moving once again."
"May I start by saying, Commissioner, that I was very pleased with what you had to say and I am as surprised to be saying that as perhaps you might be to hear me saying it."
"But given that there is a delay, which has already been deplored, I would hope that the period of that delay will be used constructively and that the Council and the Commission and indeed Parliament will reflect on how to get things as right as possible in what is clearly a key area."
"I was concerned to read a comment in the Financial Times last week when you, Commissioner, were in London - where you made quite an impact - about you forcing the creation of workers' consultation committees and stating that Anna Diamantopoulou' s decision will dismay the UK Government and industry."
"Whilst I accept that the fact that it may dismay such illustrious bodies does not automatically make your proposals wrong, I trust that you would also admit that it does not automatically make them right either."
"I would like the Commission to bear in mind that at the time when Parliament put forward the amendments last April, the composition of this Parliament was indeed very different."
"At that time the Socialists were the largest group; happily that state of affairs no longer applies and hopefully will continue to no longer apply long into the future."
"But certainly the composition of this Parliament is very different and I would expect its conclusions to be different."
"Clearly we will continue to work in a spirit of constructive consensus but the epicentre of that consensus has moved sharply."
"So finally I would say that when the second reading comes up, if we are serious about creating jobs, if we are serious about keeping our industries really competitive, if we are serious about encouraging enterprise, then some of us may feel we have gone too far and that it may well be time to draw a line."
"Mr President, I would like to say to Mr Matthews that, following my visit to London, there was a party statement accusing me of having ""crazy ideas"" ."
"I hope that this was not the general consensus."
"In response, I must say that- and politicians too are always faced with such dilemmas - you have to decide between being a likeable individual or one that is effective."
"I could quite easily be a likeable person."
"Parliament' s amendments from April could have been accepted, incorporated into a text and referred to the Council and from there on I could quite easily have said that it was just a matter for the Council."
"However, it was I who introduced the reform, accepted the proposals and forwarded them to the Council and left it in the hands of the Council to resolve."
"However, I believe that for such a demanding directive - and Parliament is quite aware that it is not a straightforward one - we must take the current state of affairs of each country, the various aspects of social dialogue, the positions of the social partners and the various discrepancies in all the points I mentioned before, piece them all together and thereby find a very fine balance between them all, so that we can be as successful as we possibly can."
"If we approve the amendments straight away, and take the new proposal to the negotiating table, then that will necessitate unanimity, which, as we all know, as things stand at present, will not achieve the desired result."
"I believe therefore that we need to be more effective and I shall endeavour to do just that."
"Already we are in constant communication with national representatives and governments, with all the individual ministers."
"In my view, this directive is not merely a directive which will help workers."
"I believe that it is of great social significance because of the major problems and reforms ahead of us."
"And we all know that there are sectors, such as the banking sector, which will undergo radical change in the coming years."
"We must therefore prepare a framework to make us all aware that it will facilitate competition, and that it will not be just a framework of social awareness, but one that will protect social equilibrium and social rest in Europe, and ensure stability and development."
"We shall proceed on this basis, and on this basis, I shall also proceed, with the aforementioned timetable, in the belief that, under the Portuguese Presidency, we will indeed be able to find a new strategy."
"I, like Ms Damião, note that there are such endeavours and laws at national level and two directives at Community level."
"With this new directive, we wish to reinforce the right of workers to be consulted and informed, which to date has not been reinforced."
"There is more to be done on a voluntary basis and this can be interpreted at will."
"We want to see stronger reinforcement and greater responsibility being taken, but we also need to have the consensus of both Member States and social partners because acceptance from all quarters will play an extremely important role in its effective implementation."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I simply wish to refer to the official status of Strasbourg, a wonderful city which nevertheless has a series of defects."
"Yesterday, I left home before 1 p.m. and arrived here just before 8 p.m."
"I had been moving from airport to airport."
"Then, fortunately, the City of Strasbourg provides a service to bring us here, but it consists of a bus which picks up a large number of passengers and we end up wasting a lot of time."
"I believe that this is a great city, where we should perhaps all meet once a year, but the rest of the time we should act in a pragmatic manner, take a practical approach to finances and work in one single headquarters, where we should all be located."
"This is much more sensible, much more rational, and I believe that that is how we should view it and, while we should praise this great city for its official status, we have to operate efficiently."
"A similar problem."
"I omitted to sign last night as I was travelling all day and arrived a bit late last evening."
"I would appreciate it if you would consider me as having been present when it comes to the Minutes."
"I was in Strasbourg yesterday evening but I omitted to sign."
"Mr President, I got to Strasbourg on time yesterday but last week my flight was delayed by several hours getting to Brussels, then I had to wait an hour and a half for a taxi, and to cap it all I fell victim to the train strike."
"I would ask you to take note of that as well."
"Mr President, I would also like to support what has just been said, and indeed I would very much have liked to have been present at the start of yesterday' s sitting since, coming from the region that has just suffered this disaster in the south of France, I would have liked to have actually been able to hear the President' s words on the subject."
"In addition to these few words, as a witness who is unfortunately very much concerned by this, I would simply like to ask if, in addition to expressing our sympathy - and the families of victims will undoubtedly appreciate it - we might, on behalf of the European Parliament, undertake a solidarity action in the form of aid which may be allocated to this region in the south which has suffered greatly, firstly for the families who have lost everything, but also for the economic resources which have been destroyed."
"Right now, there are enormous requirements, and I would like my fellow Members in the European Parliament to join this surge of solidarity which is currently making itself felt."
"I have here a special feature, which I shall pass on to you, from the local daily newspaper whose pictures clearly show the vast extent of the disaster, with over 30 dead and many more missing."
"I believe it is one of the most serious flood disasters we have had in our country."
"I hope that this wish will be followed up by the European Parliament, and I thank you for this."
"Thank you very much, Mr Esclopé."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, may we also express our sympathy towards the victims of this natural disaster."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament' s attention to the interview - published yesterday - that our President, Mrs Fontaine gave to an Italian newspaper, La Stampa, where she is openly and strongly in favour of state funding for private schools in Italy."
"Now, at the moment this matter is the subject of a very heated political debate in my country and I think it totally inappropriate, if not intolerable, for our President to side so strongly with one party, given her institutional position, what is more, overlooking the fact that an article of the Italian Constitution talks explicitly about freedom for anybody to open a private school without putting burdens on the State."
"I would therefore invite the President to take more care, at the time of a political debate in one of the countries of the Union, not to take sides and to respect, or at least take into account the existence of the constitutions in force in the various Member States of the Union."
"Mr President, I have to say that what Mr Vattimo said is not a true representation of the facts. The President of this Parliament only stated the outcome of a vote in this House on a European Parliament resolution which called on all the Member States to respect the commitment to equality of school qualifications, i.e. to facilitate scholastic equality."
"No position was taken: she only spoke of what was happening."
"However, I think that this attempt to exploit, even in this House, a political battle that the left is fighting in Italy against equality of school qualifications is absurd and not relevant to this Parliament' s work."
"Thank you very much, Mr Tajani."
"System of own resources"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Haug (A5-0052/1999) on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the system of the European Union' s own resources (COM(1999)333 - C5-0092/1999 - 1999/0139(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are getting down to serious business now, for this is about our money, or the European Union' s revenue to be precise."
"The discussions we are having today on reforming the system of own resources are directly related to the discussions we had and the decisions we reached in the spring of this year."
"I would like to draw your attention to the Commission' s comprehensive report, which presents a thorough analysis of own resources and has presented many of the options for reform which come up in discussion."
"We established our position on the own resource system, as a Parliament in March, with full knowledge of this report and following very full discussions."
"Unfortunately, the Berlin Council was unable to reach agreement on an actual reform step but contented itself with the kind of haggling for which it has long been famed."
"The outcome of the Berlin conclusions has been further complication of the own resources system and restriction of the European Union' s financial room for manoeuvre."
"This situation cannot be allowed to continue."
"We must put an end to the situation in which each Head of Government and Finance Minister in the Council only has the short-term interests of their own country at heart when it comes to planning our revenue, regardless of the consequences."
"This Community can only be sustained and developed if our common interests as a whole and our longer-term aspirations are taken account of, and if we are prepared to invest in this."
"In this connection, it is the Council' s policy in particular that merits condemnation, for it persists in committing expenditure at international donor conferences, the burden of which falls to the European budget, without ensuring that the corresponding revenue is in place."
"That being the case, the Council is not taking its dealings with the European Union' s revenue very seriously - and that is putting it mildly - and it may, in the forthcoming enlargement process, become a real handicap capable of obstructing our opportunities for development."
"However, I am also disappointed with the proposal put forward by the Commission on changing the own resource system."
"Of course, we are not under any illusions; we too are aware that the Council was not about to perform a dramatic about-turn at some point from the spring onwards, and initiate far-reaching reform."
"Obviously, I recognise that where our proposals are concerned, the Commission, as must we as a Parliament, has to take into account the mood in the Council and the positions adopted there if we want to achieve a workable outcome."
"Nevertheless, the Commission could have done more, in fact I would go so far as to say that it should have done more."
"It has trailed snail-like behind the Council, only to now place before us as a proposal something that follows the Council' s agreement to the letter."
"But it is also the role of the Commission to be the driving force of integration; at the very least, it must fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties, warding off any regulations which could damage the Community."
"In my view, it has failed to do so in the case of the present proposal."
"However, I would not want to spare us as a Parliament a certain amount of self-criticism either."
"We too could have been more courageous in our demands in respect of reform of the own resources system, and ought to have paid less attention to the discussions taking place at national level."
"At all events, we are going to have to be more consistent in the next round of reforms - which ought not to be too long in coming - if we want to ensure that the Union still has the financial power to act after enlargement and once it has additional tasks."
"That is why we want to commit the Commission to making the schedule tighter than it envisaged doing in its report."
"Allow me to make clear in a few points the work that we can and must get under way if we are to change the own resource system in such a way that it will also be possible for there to be progress towards reform."
"Firstly, planning the European Union' s revenue must be undertaken in accordance with a number of fundamental principles, without which the system would be unable to function indefinitely."
"This means that we need a system that is transparent, uniform and balanced."
"In the long-term there must be a direct link between the citizens of Europe and the European Union' s financing of its expenditure, and for the benefit of those individuals who are now calling again for there to be an increase in taxation, I would like to make quite plain that of course there must be no increase in the overall tax and contributions burden borne by the citizens, but then that was the position we took up back in March as well."
"In the foreseeable future, as long as the budget is financed by the Member States, this principle means in practice that financing must take place under the same conditions for all concerned."
"There must be no more derogations or rebates in the future."
"We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have reached agreement on this demand, and that includes those individuals from Member States that continue to benefit from such derogations or are hoping to benefit from them soon."
"It represents a great step forwards and I am very proud of it. Indeed, I would call upon all the groups to support this compromise, which will be presented to them in the form of an amendment."
"Secondly, securing and consolidating our financial power to act also means acquiring new forms of revenue that we can truly call our own and that will replace the previous ones."
"But above all, it means not tampering with the only sources of income that are truly ours, that are the Union' s by right, that is to say, our traditional own resources."
"But this is exactly what will happen if the Commission' s proposal is implemented."
"If the refund - to be retained by the Member States - of the costs associated with the collection of these traditional own resources were to be increased by 150% then such fears would certainly be justified."
"Unfortunately, the majority in the Committee did not support my request to leave this refund at 10%."
"Personally speaking though, I am able to warmly endorse the present draft amendment, expressive as it is of the desire not to raise the amounts Member States are permitted to retain to 25%, for this would leave the traditional own resources intact."
"Thirdly, if there is to be transparency, balance and manageability then the basis for financing must be unambiguous."
"The essential pillar as far as the current financing framework is concerned, is the gross domestic product of the Member States."
"This must continue to be the case for as long as the EU is financed by the Member States, for any other method would distort the system and render it illogical."
"The own resources ceiling of 1.27% expresses what proportion of gross domestic product has to be devoted to the European budget."
"This figure has become a politically reliable basis for cooperation based on partnership between Parliament and the Council."
"That is why it must be maintained and must not be changed arbitrarily."
"These are a few aspects of the proposal I am putting to you concerning changes to the own resources system."
"Unfortunately, there is no possibility of doing more at the present time since we have only limited room for manoeuvre in our actions."
"The consultation procedure in force here and, above all, the restrictive framework created by the Berlin Council' s agreements mean that we can only be moderate in our dealings."
"I would ask you all though, to at least give me your support as far as these draft amendments are concerned."
"Mr President, Berlin may not be ideal, but the Committee on Budgetary Control deemed it the best possible outcome in the current climate."
"Top of the agenda of the Committee on Budgetary Control was - what else can we do?: how can we monitor things in the best possible way?"
"We have decided to maintain our viewpoint, as Mrs Haug has just stated that we must maintain the own resources ceiling at 1.27%, provided that the old calculation method is maintained."
"With regard to the cost of collection, the Committee on Budgetary Control has not objected to the increase in this cost from 10 to 25%."
"As for the stand-by percentage of VAT resources, the Committee on Budgetary Control agrees with a reduction thereof and also approves of this reduction occurring one year earlier than planned in the Committee' s proposals."
"We are also of the opinion, as has been expressed by the Committee on Budgetary Control itself, that it is necessary that a reserve is built into the expenditure for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund so as to be able to cushion unforeseen expenses."
"As I have already stated, it is obvious that the control on revenue is paramount for the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In this respect, we have attempted to refer to the work of this Parliament' s first Committee of Inquiry, the Committee of Inquiry which was involved in fraud in transit."
"Since the publication of this Committee' s report, we have heard very little in this respect."
"We would like to change this."
"We would like to be kept informed by the Committee on a regular basis."
"What is to be gained from having a situation whereby revenue is collected from the Union which belongs to the Union but the work involved is carried out by the national services?"
"We have therefore managed to have an amendment adopted which stipulates that in the year 2003, the Committee will need to submit an extensive report to demonstrate the level of improvements achieved since the work of this Committee of Inquiry."
"Finally, Mr President, the Committee on Budgetary Control is of the opinion that, at the half-way stage, we should once again look into a new system of own resources because if new countries join, the current system could well prove to be too complex."
"Mr President, the own resources system is the hub of European policy; it directly affects 370 million citizens with national and economic sensibilities of very different types."
"The rapporteur applies certain questionable criteria, for example she accuses the Commission of having limited itself to applying Council guidelines."
"We must remind the rapporteur that that was the task which the Council entrusted to the Commission: to transform the political equilibrium of the fifteen into a concrete and viable proposal."
"We agree with the rapporteur' s request for a more transparent and simpler system, which is intelligible to all the citizens of Europe."
"We also agree that there is a need to take account of the citizen' s fiscal capacity and a need to seek new sources of income."
"The current system still contains regressive elements which should be modified."
"We believe, however, that this is neither the time nor the place to impose expiry dates on the British rebate and the reductions granted to certain countries in the funding of the said rebate, especially when these proposed decisions have still not been approved in the various national Parliaments."
"It seems to us inappropriate to launch into this debate at the moment."
"The benefits of belonging to the European Union cannot only be measured in budgetary terms, since there is the possibility that imbalances will be created."
"The Berlin agreements are a combination of the total level and the composition of spending, political reforms and the own resources system."
"The said combination must guarantee equity within a budgetary framework which includes enlargement."
"It is for this reason that it seems to us so inadvisable to modify the Berlin decision in the absence of a solid basis."
"Neither do we share your apprehensions concerning the application of the ESA(95)."
"It is an accounting system which allows for a broader base for GDP resources and, consequently, greater financial resources, without surpassing the relative index expressly laid down in the Berlin agreements and in the interinstitutional agreement."
"Your fears concerning the modification of the 1.27% can simply be corrected by a downward adjustment of the ceiling on the said resources."
"It is therefore an unnecessary amendment."
"Neither do we consider the amendments on the traditional own resources to be necessary."
"The 25% which the Member States are going to retain for collection expenses will allow for an administrative improvement in customs efficiency and the fight against fraud, which is an aspect that is frequently pointed out by the Court of Auditors."
"We also reject the idea of rewarding success in collection since this is incompatible with the principle of equity."
"Finally we cannot accept the amendments which modify the timescale for the entry into force of the decision on own resources."
"Neither the political reality of the Union, nor the needs of enlargement, and much less the complexity of implementing a system which, in 1997 alone, cost EUR 82,469 million, make it advisable for Parliament to vote for changes to the said timescale."
"Finally, we appreciate the continued efforts of the rapporteur, at least over the last year, in bringing together positions and putting forward a common position on behalf of this Parliament."
"There are already broad areas of consensus on the basis of which we can contribute to improving the funding of the Union, but the result of the vote in the Committee on Budgets shows that there are some ideas on which we are far from reaching a consensus."
"For many of us, our final vote will depend on the result of the voting on various amendments, but, in its current wording, we prefer the Commission' s text."
"I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for addressing some of the key problems in the current system of own resources."
"In her report, Mrs Haug is right to check the Commission' s arbitrary changes introduced through the back door, via a mathematical operation relating to the ceiling on own resources."
"Now in the interinstitutional agreement, the Council entered into a binding agreement with the European Parliament on the percentage of GNP, i.e. 1.27%."
"The Commission is now saying that this means cash value of 1.27%."
"This is not acceptable."
"The rapporteur emphasises that we should be striving to establish a more equitable system of financing the EU."
"The Community budget should have a fair system of revenue collection."
"The traditional own resources, for example, are a systematic source of inequitable burdens on Member States and, as has been said, are prone to fraud and excessive bureaucracy."
"Instead, the EU budget should be funded on the basis of criteria which improve the fairness of the system and what I would like to see therefore is a fair system of net contributions."
"I am speaking here on behalf of the Socialist Group, but if I were speaking as a British member, I would question particular references to the British rebate."
"If the budget is to be fair, there should not only be a fair system of contributions but also a fair system of spending."
"Unfortunately, such a fair system appears to be a long way off."
"I believe that a really serious attempt to reform the Community' s finances should start by making sure that all Member States get their fair share of expenditure."
"Until this happens, attempts to reform the own resources system will not improve the situation."
"Therefore, what I want to see is a proper reform of the EU' s finances for the future."
"But reform cannot be focused on single issues such as the rebate and I feel very uneasy about discussing this issue at this stage in the new Parliament."
"It is too early to be making decisions on this subject and setting things in tablets of stone when all the facts are not in front of us."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank Mrs Haug for a very well prepared report."
"It continues a series of reports in which Mrs Haug has meritoriously and comprehensively analysed the EU' s system of own resources."
"The report under discussion is based on the decisions taken at the Berlin Summit, which involve many compromises."
"The most important basis mentioned were the estimates for Member States' contributions, reconciliation on which became more important than safeguarding EU financing."
"The cornerstone of the system of own resources is still, however, the percentage a member pays out of GNP."
"The ceiling for committed contributions remains at 1.27% of GNP, which guarantees that EU revenue rises with inflation and general economic growth."
"But this is where the system' s clarity ends."
"First, the premium paid for the collection of traditional own resources, i.e. customs duty and agricultural levies, was increased to 25%."
"This rise in the rate is, in fact, a clear concession to those countries that collect mostly customs duties, relatively speaking."
"The rise was justified by the need to collect contributions more efficiently, but that is not sufficient justification."
"Politically, the most problematic issue is the rebate in respect of contributions by the United Kingdom."
"The UK has been a member of the EU for 30 years, so it cannot be a matter of a transitional stage."
"The same might be said for the agreement made on the payment of this rebate."
"The reduced contributions by Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria do not have any proper justification either."
"Mrs Haug' s report contains a proposal whereby a report on amending the system should be drafted before 2004."
"It should examine in particular concessions on contributions and the possibility of creating a new system of own resources that would relate directly to the public, without increasing their burden of taxation."
"The Liberals support this reform, all the while stressing that the burden of taxation must not be increased."
"Perhaps new forms of own resources could include environmental protection taxes, as environmental questions concern all, and not just the new Member States."
"It is important, however, that the new system outlined in the report should come into effect in all respects from the beginning of 2007."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"She has hit the nail on the head with her observation that at the Berlin Summit, political ideals and ambitions had to give way to a short-sighted bookkeeping mentality."
"The European Union' s own resources have the feel of national contributions."
"This is why the discussion on the system of own resources is being dominated by a net mentality: who are the net payers of the European Union and who make the net profits?"
"It will be clear that the economic benefits appeal to the individual Member States, to the detriment of values such as stability, solidarity and welfare in the long term."
"It is regrettable that the net payers mainly focus on the revenue side of the budget."
"Consequently, a net mentality will mainly lead to missed chances."
"For example, the Netherlands has turned its back on the fund for refugees, a fund which, by the Netherlands own admission, it would benefit from disproportionately."
"But the Netherlands had prioritised ""money back from Europe"" over and above ""value for money"" ."
"The Berlin straitjacket means, above all, that Europe cannot realise its responsibilities."
"It leads to proposals in which Turkey, purely from financial motives, is offered a different political route of access."
"It leads to transitional periods which are far too long for the other candidate countries in terms of the environment, for fear that otherwise this, and I quote from the government document, ""would lead to an increase in financial strain"" ."
"Unexpected events - which are always to be expected - lead to unfortunate mishaps, to proposals where the reconstruction of Kosovo is at the expense of developing countries."
"The Berlin Summit could also be dubbed the Summit of national exemption positions."
"Four countries were exempted from contributing to the United Kingdom' s exemption position."
"The rapporteur adopted a very wise viewpoint in this respect and has formulated a goal which I support, namely the abolition of all these exemption positions."
"The four countries which, rightly so, have rejected the British correction mechanism, should make an effort to rectify this situation."
"In respect of levies, it has been proposed that the Member States can now retain 25% instead of 10%."
"Contrary to the rapporteur, I welcome this development, and I would even take it one step further. As far as I am concerned, Member States should be allowed to keep 100%, as long as we increase the rebate via the percentage of GNP."
"The GNP eminently reflects the economic development in Member States."
"It is, to my mind, therefore, the fairest instrument to distribute Europe' s financial responsibility over the Member States."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug, first I would like to offer my thanks."
"Examining your report was a pleasure both for political and intellectual reasons."
"I firmly believe that the report describes what is deemed to be politically feasible, but I think that in view of the challenges that lie before us, it is our responsibility to draw up fundamental reforms aimed not at what is deemed to be politically feasible but rather at what is considered to be politically necessary."
"If one wants to change a system then one must establish clearly in one' s own mind what the disadvantages of the current system are, and I believe that these can be summed up under the following four main headings."
"Firstly, the existing EU own resources system has a very rigid framework."
"The sources of revenue are limited in number, some are on the wane and additional expenditure can only ever be financed if expenditure elsewhere is cut to pay for this."
"However, European integration has now reached such proportions that we have simply reached the limit of our capacity where this framework is concerned."
"This means that tasks such as enlargement of the Union, upholding human rights worldwide, and creating basic conditions for combating severe unemployment can no longer be tackled using this framework."
"Secondly, if we want to be effective in our discussions on reform in this Parliament then ultimately, we as a Parliament must also be given the opportunity to have our say on all the aspects of the process."
"In this respect, the powers of the European Parliament in budgetary matters do not go nearly far enough."
"Thirdly, the existing structures for budgetary decision making are such that it is extraordinarily difficult for fundamental reform to be carried out."
"It stands to reason that the Member States will not exhaust the established ceilings when they are under pressure at home to have to overhaul their budgets and maintain the stability criteria."
"Fourthly, discussion about a fair and balanced structure is justified on the one hand but also absurd on the other."
"Absurd because the Member States interpret the concept of fairness in such a way that, in the final analysis, they want to get out of the European Union' s budget that which they put in."
"That being the case, I for one would be only too happy to spare us the detour via the European Union."
"Fairness within the European Union can only mean one thing, namely that the original objectives of economic development, prosperity, and the balancing out of developmental differences constitute the criteria by which fairness is measured."
"Ultimately, every budget represents the financial implementation of political strategies."
"The European Union has undertaken to do a great deal in the course of the next few years."
"If, in so doing, we are only ever going to try and reduce expenditure, then it will simply not be possible to do justice to our political needs."
"And if, in addition, rebates, corrections to contributions and so on are to be introduced, then it is only fair to say that any enterprise carrying on in this way would go bankrupt."
"This means that we must now concentrate our minds on how we can improve our revenue."
"Europe needs a financial instrument that, aside from the funds arising from gross domestic product, is independent of the particularist interests of the Member States."
"In other words, we need to raise our own taxes."
"The first report in March cited a whole range of positive suggestions to this effect, i.e. an eco-tax, a CO2-tax, taxation on the creaming-off of short-term speculative gains, ECB profits."
"This is the path we must go down if the European Parliament and European Union are to have sufficient own resources at their disposal in the future."
"Mr President, last March Parliament examined a first Haug report on own resources."
"Now we have another, a sort of Haug II, Return of the Haug, but it is a poor sort of comeback."
"On 11 March, in our resolution, we voted in a paragraph stating: ""believes that the revenue system should as a matter of principle be rid of exemptions and special arrangements"" etc."
"We are well aware of what the Berlin Council made of this and what the Council based its Berlin Agreement on."
"Now, six months later in November, we are examining a report which makes no mention of this point except for a single amendment which, for my part, I would like to see adopted, but it is a Recital which attempts to say more or less the same thing in even vaguer terms."
"The fundamental problem before us may be summed up simply as follows: either the system of own resources is referred to us under co-participation, as part of the package of measures which Parliament is asking the IGC to deal with so as to make it, as it were, more democratic, with greater participation, or else, unfortunately, all we can do on this point is note that the ball is in the Council' s court and will stay there for a long time if our proposals are not taken into consideration."
"I believe and I hope, therefore, that Parliament may, on the basis of this report, be supported with revenue by this reference in particular as well as by others, and by the elements contained in it, and that Parliament will associate itself to a formal demand, according to which the Intergovernmental Conference will be authorised to tackle both the proposed reforms and also this fundamental aspect of the full participation of Parliament not only as regards the ""expenditure"" but also as regards the ""revenue"" of the Union budget."
"Mr President, almost thirty years ago it was decided to replace the system of revenues then in force, based on the contribution of the Member States, with a system of own resources."
"The importance of this decision is obvious."
"Now that three decades have passed, the weaknesses of the current system are only too well known."
"It is not adequate and it is not simple, logical, transparent or fair."
"It is therefore unsustainable."
"It is the result of successive, confused judgements which have been forced by the needs, pressures and interests of those who, in different contexts and historical periods, have had the ability to protect them."
"The perverse relationship between the contribution from each Member State and its relative ability to guarantee it is unacceptable."
"The United Kingdom' s system of positive discrimination, based on the destructive concept of fair return is unjustifiable."
"The idea of investing the European Union with own resources has, for this reason, remained a good intention."
"Even now, instead of introducing urgently needed reform, the Berlin Council has limited itself to a new raft of small judgements that have resulted from major commitments."
"To insist on the current logic of expenditure in which the consequences of the common agricultural policy are increased, which, apart from jeopardising any aim for fairness which has been accepted as a principle of the Treaties, is political in name only. To insist on the system of revenues currently in force, the product of different, contradicting interests, is irreparably incompatible with the desire to develop the project of enlargement of our geographical area."
"All of this has been studied, known and discussed for far too long. We are not even talking about disproportionate resources."
"This is a sum that corresponds, in the Council' s proposal for Budget 2000, to only 1.10% of the Community' s GNP and this year could reach 1.27%."
"This is a fundamental issue."
"The success of the European Union' s pledge before its citizens and the world depends on our ability to show that we are facing up to the necessary reform."
"I know that this is a complex issue, as I know what a utopian idea it would be to try to start afresh."
"The past cannot be erased and has produced many good things. But to continue postponing decisions on this matter is to postpone much more than a difficult decision on the European Union financing system."
"It would affect a project in which I consciously maintain confidence, as do so many of our fellow citizens, aware as I am of its problems and its potential."
"Only a new approach to the issue of own resources which does not increase the fiscal burden on taxpayers, one which makes the system more transparent, simpler and more rational can provide the European Union with equitable conditions."
"Mr President, listening to the spokesperson of the Group of the European People' s Party, I sincerely wonder why we exercise the right of consultation in this matter."
"Berlin was a step backwards in the field of own resources and, in general, in the field of European solidarity and construction of the political union."
"Both elements are probably linked, but I would not dare now to state which is the correct order of cause and effect."
"In any event, Parliament criticised it severely in the Spring."
"The decision on own resources which we are discussing today, which is merely a translation on the part of the Commission of the European Council' s political decision, is the best evidence of this retrograde step."
"All the features of the system which may lead to confusion between own resources and national contributions are highlighted."
"I wonder, by the way, why these national contributions were abrogated in Maastricht."
"Parliament' s position is to condemn and rule out the application of the so-called principle of fair return to the European budget."
"Well, Berlin has confirmed that principle, and without daring to admit it, naturally, they have sided with Mrs Thatcher."
"There was a disputed British rebate, for historic reasons which are becoming less apparent but which are understandable."
"Berlin maintains it but also offers four small rebates to Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands, which are not exactly the poorest countries in Europe."
"It increases the already scandalous 10% prima de collection premium to an unspeakable 25%."
"The only real justification for such an aberration is to lower the Dutch bill, despite the fact that the payment - to use the Council' s terminology - is inflated to the benefit of the Dutch coffers as a result of the Rotterdam effect."
"And that is what they want to hide."
"The Commission' s proposal is completely unsatisfactory, as was the Council' s decision."
"We will only resolve the problems of own resources when we accept that the contributors are not the Member States but the citizens."
"What is unjust is the fact that two European citizens with an identical income make different contributions because of the mere fact that one lives in Frankfurt and the other in Seville."
"That is where the injustice lies."
"Therefore, it should be made clear that the objective must be that the citizens directly shoulder the burden of the Community budget without an opaque system of resources which will mask the process and prevent democratic accountability."
"Meanwhile, temporary solutions should be aimed at ensuring a certain degree of justice and transparency and not the reverse."
"Mr President, the draft resolution proposes to increase the European Union' s own resources and to distribute them among the States in a different way."
"The real problem is not between States, or between the States and the European Union. The real problem is between social classes."
"Of course, the draft resolution states, hypocritically, that this should not lead to an increase in the burden of charge on the European citizen."
"But it seems obvious that this is just an empty hope, and that future European taxes will be added to the others."
"I am all the more opposed to any idea of increasing taxes because taxation, whether it be national or European, bears down on the working classes in particular."
"Throughout Europe the main taxation resource is the indirect taxes which are particularly unfair since they are paid by both the poorest and millionaires at the same rate."
"Thus, the most badly paid employees and even the unemployed or the homeless, when paying VAT on their food, are contributing towards financing the European institutions which, nonetheless, have not undertaken a single measure in their favour."
"The basic raison d'être of the European Union is to favour large firms by sweeping the obstacles out of their path, unifying their market in Europe and supporting them on the international market."
"And if it is necessary to pay more for the European institutions which are working on their behalf, well then, let the major firms pay, let us tax their profits and the dividends of shareholders, let them be forced to pay."
"Mr President, more autonomy in raising own resources will automatically mean - and I agree with the previous speaker here - a heavier burden for the European citizens."
"At the end of the day it will only lead to additional taxes being brought in and not to certain taxes being abolished."
"We believe that it will only be possible to reform the system of own resources with the agreement of the national parliaments, for we will also have to take their ideas into account."
"It goes without saying that we are in favour of systems being simpler and more transparent, and that ultimately we are also in favour of the burden on the citizens of Europe being eased rather than increased, so that we in Europe can achieve greater economic growth and in this way raise more taxes for the Union, that is to say for the national Member States."
"Before we advocate more autonomy though, we must exploit, that is to say fully explore, every available opportunity for making savings in the EU budget, and we must also explain to the citizens of the Union why we are permitting ourselves expenditure for two parliaments and are not coming up with simpler systems that would relieve the burden on the citizens of the Union rather than add to it."
"We will advocate simpler and more transparent systems, but we will not advocate putting even more pressure on the citizens of the Union in the form of additional taxation."
"Mr President, a system of own resources gives rise to four questions: who must pay, what are the bases for payment, what must be paid and who must decide to enforce payment?"
"Neither the Commission nor Parliament have the power to provide an answer to these four questions."
"In this affair, we are the imaginary actors in a play written by someone else."
"Mrs Haug with her report has the great merit of doing this, by setting out a number of problems and heading in the right direction."
"Who must pay?"
"States or individuals and economic operators?"
"Current evolution is towards States and not towards individuals and economic operators."
"It is a dangerous tendency, going towards intergovernmentalism, towards the UN-isation of our system of resources."
"What are the bases for payment?"
"Proportionality, progressive increase?"
"We may well hesitate."
"Something that we can observe today is that if there is a step in the right direction, towards proportionality, we are in the process of inventing a new system, which involves making the contribution fit the expenditure. I pay, therefore I receive."
"I receive, therefore I pay. I give you subsidies, on condition that you pay for them."
"It is absurd!"
"The situation is completely surreal."
"What must be paid?"
"Is anyone considering how much longer we can continue with such a limited collection rate at a time when the European Union is taking on more and more new responsibilities relating to the continuation of monetary union and enlargement of the Union, and to the assumption of foreign and security policy responsibilities?"
"In this respect, our schizophrenia is rampant."
"Finally, who decides who must pay?"
"At the moment, it is the States, and States only."
"This mechanism must absolutely be reformed."
"It is essential for the matter of own resources to be the focus of the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, following the Berlin Agreement, and the interinstitutional agreement, it was mandatory to review the system of own resources of the European Union in order to weight the shares of each Member State correctly."
"The report by Jutta Haug recalls the objective of this overhaul."
"It is fourfold: to simplify the system, to create greater transparency thus making it more comprehensible, to strengthen the financial autonomy of the European Union and to reduce the imbalances between Member States' shares in the budget."
"The envisaged readjustment of the balance between the four types of resource and, in particular, the reduction of the VAT share in favour of the GNP-related share of each country is of particular interest, since it is far more equitable."
"It is a better reflection of each citizen' s actual capacity to contribute."
"We consider this important, and it must be pursued."
"While various elements have been underlined by previous speakers, I would like to return to two specific points."
"Firstly, it is essential that the imbalances in the current budget shares due to rebates, which are perhaps justified in terms of previous history, should be gradually, progressively but persistently dismantled and that the contributions of each country are brought to what they should be in objective, accounting terms."
"This simplification is essential for the equity of the system and for the transparency of management, two imperatives which will go towards ensuring the future of Europe."
"Particularly on the eve of enlargement, current practices for rebates or reductions are no longer justified and must therefore be inexorably abandoned."
"The second point I wish to draw your attention to is one I find extremely strange."
"It is the request made by Member States to deduct administrative costs for collecting this tax, which may go from 10% to 25%."
"What justification is there for this usurious inflation?"
"The strengthening of supervision and follow-up tasks for food safety are perfectly standard activities for states."
"The 10% basic rate must therefore be maintained, making it possible to amply cover the expenses incurred in this task."
"On behalf of the Parliament, I expect the Commission to take up the requirements mentioned above, since they are essential to our political objectives of clarity, transparency and equity."
"Mr President, I believe that reform of the own resources system is necessary if we are to strengthen the principles of transparency, fairness, solidarity and cohesion, with the corresponding extension to the area of Community revenue."
"And, in the same context, we reject concepts such as fair return or the false issue of net financial contributions."
"I understand that such a reform will have to target national contributions that correspond effectively to the respective economic development, so the GNP will have to be strengthened as an essential indicator for such contributions."
"This is what we have always maintained, in clear opposition to the repeated but inconsequential proposals for creating new jobs as a source of own resources."
"This is why, on this matter, we agree with the Commission' s current proposal. We want to emphasise, though, that what is particularly relevant at the moment is the obvious shortfall in resources, a situation which is entirely due to the lack of political will and not to a need to reform the system of own resources."
"I would like first of all to reject the argument made by a number of people here that to increase own resources is to increase the burden of taxation on the citizens of Europe."
"That is, of course, not necessarily true."
"The responsibilities of the European Union are based on the principle that there are some things we can do more efficiently at European level."
"If we decide to transfer responsibility for agricultural industry from the Member States to the European Union and discharge that responsibility more efficiently, the end result could in fact be a reduction in the burden of taxation."
"Similarly, if we decided to transfer responsibility, say, for development cooperation, from the Member States to the European Union, I believe we could achieve immensely more in the world with the same amount of money and we could increase own resources while at the same time not increasing the burden of taxation on the citizens of the European Union."
"We talk about democracy and transparency."
"First of all I would say that anything that we decide in a democratic way, through the institutions of the Union, about own resources, is what own resources are."
"If the European Union, in a democratic process, decides that own resources are simply a straight percentage of GDP collected by the Member States and passed over in a lump sum, that is fair enough: that is what own resources are and that is democratic."
"The more elements we drag in, the more un-transparent we make the system, the more difficult it becomes."
"That is why I am not concerned in the least by the 10% or the 25%."
"If we have a fixed figure that the European Union needs as own resources, then obviously if we leave the Member States more of what we call the traditional own resources, we have to collect more of that as a percentage of GNP."
"So this argument is not important all."
"The balance of advantage, or the balance of returns to Member States, is extremely difficult to calculate."
"Let me make one further point on this."
"If you look at Holland and Germany, on whose behalf there was so much crying in this Parliament, you will find that the single market has given them immense benefits and they have had extremely positive balances in their trade with the rest of the Union over the years."
"Mr President, the EU will be faced with having to make very large financial investments when, in different rounds, ten or more countries from Eastern and Central Europe and from the Baltic region become members."
"Clearly, there is occasion for discussing the EU' s financial requirements if this process is to be managed successfully."
"At present, the EU is not entitled to raise taxes itself. Nor, as I see it, should it be entitled to do so in the future either."
"The Haug report does not involve our automatically introducing taxation by the EU, but it opens the door for taxation of this kind, which is bad enough."
"What is not spelled out is nonetheless what a lot of people are obviously thinking."
"In the last few days, the Swedish mass media have been saying that the EU intends to introduce a tax on flights and mobile telephones."
"It is perhaps no accident that it is precisely in Sweden, which has far and away the heaviest burden of taxation in the EU, that imaginations are running riot when it comes to finding new forms of income from taxation."
"If taxes are to be directly discussed at all within the EU, then the Member States must first, in my view, show clearly and precisely which national taxes are to be reduced at the same time."
"Otherwise, our citizens will just be afflicted with new forms of taxation, and the EU' s citizens do not need still higher taxes."
"How, then, is the enlargement of the EU to be financed?"
"Yes, the alternative to new income from taxation is still that of reduced costs."
"This will involve better prioritising and concentrating on the major and crucial questions."
"The enlargement of the EU is one such priority."
"As long as almost half the EU' s budget goes on subsidising agriculture and as long as five sixths of it, including the Structural Funds, goes on subsidies of one kind or another, there can be no doubt that changes can still be made."
"Mr President, Mrs Haug, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the revenue side of the budget is as important as the expenditure side of the European Commission' s budget, albeit we do not have an annual debate on the latter."
"At the Berlin Summit, changes to the revenue side were agreed on in respect of the maximum proportion of VAT paid to the EU, the British contribution rebate and the financing thereof, and with regard to the proportion of customs duties and agricultural levies that can be retained by the Member States."
"The Commission considers that we are justified in raising this amount to 25%."
"However, I would also like to make quite plain the fact that in return, I would expect the Member States to step up the measures for supervising the own resources as appropriate and to stop trying to talk their way out of this, so that these supervisory measures really do start showing favourable results."
"A decision was also reached as to when the Commission is to review the current financing system and report on the possibility of raising autonomous own resources."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament has again had such an in-depth debate on the financing structure and I personally welcome still more the fact that I have been able to discern a great deal of common ground between my own basic position and the positions expressed today in the contributions to the debate."
"In October 1998, the Commission presented a report on the revenue side of the budget and possibilities for reform."
"Many arguments put forward in this report are the same as those ventured by Parliament in its earlier Haug I report and in the Haug II report that we have here before us."
"All deliberations on reform ought to concentrate, above all, on making the revenue side transparent, effective and simple."
"There is no longer transparency in the current system on account of the copious individual provisions relating to the VAT rate of collection, the British rebate and the financing thereof."
"The citizens are no longer able to tell what proportion of their taxes is spent on the European Union."
"This lack of transparency is a bad thing and as such is reason enough, in my view, for us to endeavour to make reforms."
"I share the view - as I emphasised during my hearing before this Parliament back in September - that it should be our aim in reforming the financing system to strengthen the financial autonomy of the Community."
"We need to create the opportunity to establish revenue without - and I want to stress this point - increasing the overall burden on the taxpayer."
"I also share the view that an equitable approach to planning the budget is not something that should be reserved for the revenue side alone, and I share the view that we should not wait until the year 2006 to have a debate on reform, but rather that the debate, together with its administrative back-up, should take place in this legislative period."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Budgetary discipline"
"The next item is the report (A5-0055/1999) by Mr Averoff, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on budgetary discipline ((COM(1999) 364 - C5-0141/1999 - 1999/0151(CNS))."
"Mr President, the 1994 decision on budgetary discipline is, without a doubt, outdated on several counts."
"A great deal of water has passed under the bridge since it was first applied and numerous important changes have come to bear in the interim, the most important being the introduction of EMU on 1 January 1999, the pursuit of enlargement with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta and, finally, Agenda 2000, which sets out, inter alia, the changes needed in the agricultural sector."
"These changes and the strengthening of budgetary discipline apparent in both the conclusions of the Berlin European Council and the new interinstitutional agreement are the main reasons why this decision needs to be amended and supplemented with new mechanisms."
"The Committee has referred to these developments and has drawn on experience to date in implementing the current decision in order to arrive at today' s proposal, which seeks to amend and strengthen the current guideline, which refers specifically to agricultural expenditure."
"However, the proposal does not confine itself to adjusting certain provisions; it also makes changes to tighten budgetary discipline and to strengthen the procedure used to achieve it, as evidenced by the preventive nature of the proposed measures."
"This marks a new approach and entails an increase in the management responsibilities of the European Commission."
"The changes which accompany the report under discussion accommodate the majority of proposals relating to adjustments to provisions."
"In addition, however, certain adjustments have been improved and rendered more functional, without detracting from their efficiency."
"Certain measures which were automatic are now no longer so, while care has been taken not to over-react."
"This means that the facilities provided for in the interinstitutional agreement must be used before these measures are applied."
"It was also decided to reject the proposal to replace the decision by a regulation since the fact that the measures are adopted as a decision has no effect on their efficacy."
"This change merely seeks to maintain a balance between the authority of the institutions."
"In all, the fundamental arrangements are as stringent as before and there are no changes which affect the principle of budgetary discipline."
"Budgetary discipline is indispensable and must govern both Community and national budgets, forming as it does the basis for sound budgetary management."
"However, I would stress that budgetary discipline is not an end in itself and must not stand in the way of proper and efficient application of the basic provisions of Community law or, in this case, affect the basic principles of the common agricultural policy."
"Mr President, I consider that the report under discussion and the proposals contained in it, as formulated by the Committee on Budgets, represent a strict but balanced and efficient way of strengthening budgetary discipline. Budgetary discipline affects all of us, but it can only be applied where there is basic cooperation between the institutions and with the Member States."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to point out that there was very little input in the procedure leading up to this report; apart from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and a few fellow members who helped with the changes, I cannot in all honesty say that there was a great deal of input."
"I realise that my report is far from perfect and that numerous other changes could have been included; however, I fear that Parliament finds the word discipline somewhat disagreeable."
"Mr President, for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the principle aspects of this report on budgetary discipline on which we have presented amendments are the following:"
"Firstly, the new coverage of the agricultural guidelines and their future revision."
"The Commission includes within the scope of the guidelines the available amounts foreseen in the Financial Perspective for accession, which appear in heading 8 of the interinstitutional agreement."
"This heading envisages a hypothetical scenario prior to enlargement for the purposes of mere illustration and orientation."
"Therefore, we understand that it is not possible to include it within the guidelines."
"In fact, the correct thing to do would be to re-examine the guidelines before the first enlargement on the basis of the real needs so as not to block a series of guideline appropriations with total uncertainty with regard to their suitability in terms of amount as well as timescale."
"Secondly, the adequate funding of rural development and the accompanying measures."
"In this respect, the Commission is urged to introduce sufficient flexibility in its management in order to respond appropriately to the multiannual and non-compulsory nature of these expenses."
"On the other hand, we consider it necessary to also improve funding conditions and, therefore, we propose the possibility of carrying out transfers of unused appropriations from compulsory to non-compulsory expenditure."
"Thirdly, the implementation of the principle of flexibility within certain limits for agricultural expenditure, proposing the transfer to the following budgetary year of unused expenses or resources."
"We consider that this would not only improve the funding of the second pillar of the CAP, but that it would make it possible to deal with disasters or unexpected situations with the speed and efficiency that such events require."
"Lastly, in relation to the increases in the management powers of the Commission, by means of which it can reduce the amount of direct aid or suspend the payment of monthly advances to the States, we consider that Parliament is not sufficiently involved in the adoption of these measures."
"And we also believe that they cannot be used in a systematic way because that could lead to a budgetary overrun year after year at the expense of the real needs of the budget over which they are exercised, which could even result in peace itself being put at risk."
"Mr President, Mr Averoff' s report on budgetary discipline is excellent and it affects the implementation of the next budget."
"The European Parliament has always been in favour of discipline."
"This means that Parliament has refrained from increasing its expenditure, although there may have been sums set aside for this in the margins, the Financial Perspectives or the basic agreement itself."
"Parliament has been very strict in the area of staff increases."
"The report now under discussion concerns agricultural expenditure."
"Agricultural expenditure is the EU' s largest item of expenditure, taking approximately 45% of the budget."
"For that reason, agricultural expenditure is the major consideration when we are discussing the EU budget."
"The ceiling for them is determined by a policy of agricultural expenditure."
"In practice, the ceiling is an interinstitutional agreement, which is clearly lower than the expenditure policy."
"This is another clear indication of Parliament' s accountability in matters of the budget."
"Agricultural expenditure is a rather sensitive issue within the EU, as agricultural policy is the only area where the EU has a direct influence on citizens' livelihoods."
"In its practice of agricultural policy the EU has an exceptionally great responsibility."
"This particularly concerns the reduction of direct subsidies mentioned in Article 5(7)."
"Such a situation cannot arise, as it concerns directly a reduction in the income of individual persons and is thus a curtailment of their constitutional rights."
"It would be the same as withholding pay."
"Agricultural expenditure now divides into compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"LFA aid and environmental aid, in particular, are important in many less favoured agricultural areas."
"It follows that in future Parliament will have an even greater responsibility than before for agricultural policy."
"In this regard, the spirit of the report, which stresses the importance of cooperation between the Council and Parliament, is very good."
"Mr President, Commissioner, would you support me in my observation that the proposal you are making means that the Council' s commitments will actually be eliminated from the compulsory funds but the Council' s rights, in particular those pertaining to the re-routing of surplus funds, will be preserved, which means in effect that there will be a switch from compulsory funds to non-compulsory funds without Parliament retaining its sovereign rights over this sector of the budget?"
"I do not share your view Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"However, you all know what my view is on the issue of the division between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"This division is an existing state of affairs though and one that will certainly merit more and more discussion."
"Regarding the matter of interchangeability between these two categories, I might point out that in the course of the debate on the next report we will discuss how those funds that were not required in the agricultural sector - i.e. in the 1A categories, in respect of market regulation measures - on account of price and market trends, can be re-allocated and made available for other measures."
"Mr President, in my capacity as draftsman for the interinstitutional agreement from which this decision is derived, I would like to know the Commission' s position, because no statement has been made with regard to our proposal to exclude the expenses foreseen for future accession from the guidelines."
"I say this because in the interinstitutional agreement they appear in a merely illustrative capacity and outside the Financial Perspective, in Annex II."
"The Financial Perspective appears only in Annex I. Instead, the Commission' s proposal includes expenses which do not form part of the Financial Perspective within the guidelines."
"Mr Colom i Naval, the decision was taken in Agenda 2000 to create a separate heading for expenditure on enlargement."
"In fact, the decision was also taken to establish measures for development aid in the agricultural policy sector now."
"I believe that was an important decision."
"When it comes to the question as to whether the expenditure earmarked for agricultural policy will be sufficient, it is certainly necessary to keep a constant eye on how the situation in the applicant countries is evolving and to establish what the assumptions were that the Berlin Summit based its estimate of necessary expenditure on."
"If I conclude that these assumptions will need to be revised, then I will inform Parliament immediately and, I will, of course, make it my business to enter into discussion with the Committee on Budgets on how the situation should be handled."
"Supplementary and amending budget No 5/1999"
"The next item is the statement on the report (A5-0061/1999) by Mrs Dührkop-Dührkop, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on supplementary and amending budget No 5/1999."
"Mr President, I could limit my intervention to simply presenting the supplementary and amending budget SAB 5 and explaining my recommendation to vote in this Parliament."
"But, Mr President, we have to understand that SAB 5 cannot be seen in isolation, but that it forms a whole with SAB 4 and what we call the global transfer and the Notenboom procedure."
"Allow me, then, to begin with some thoughts which are directed at the Commission."
"On presenting the SAB 4 and in the tripartite dialogue, on the 7th, before the adoption of that SAB 4, the Commission announced that the supplementary and necessary payment appropriations - EUR 650.5 million in particular for PHARE, TACIS, Obnova and FYROM - were covered, or were going to be covered, by means of three instruments: SAB 4, the global transfer and SAB 5, which today is the object of our debate and resolution."
"And SAB 5 would also serve to increase the posts in OLAF from 15 to 30, as the supervisory committee recommended in its report on this body, so that OLAF may begin to work in accordance with the priorities which had already been identified."
"On 15 September, Parliament discussed SAB 4 and it was then approved, both by Parliament and by the Council, in the vote in plenum."
"Today SAB 5 is also being debated."
"But with regard to the global transfer, which is one of the three instruments, and which the Commission had presented to increase the payment appropriations, part of this whole does not pass through this procedure in the Plenum."
"It passes a little more unnoticed through the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"But you will allow me, since this is part of the whole, to make some observations and take this opportunity to quote directly the small gems of arguments which the Commission uses to transfer payments between the different lines and transfer them towards external actions."
"I shall begin with a curious issue, which is the reduction in the line which is called ""European Union Celebrations for the Millennium"" ."
"The Commission' s justification for removing all the payments from there is: ""The planned activities are not taking place."""
"Next I have three lines, ""Special actions for the benefit of the Baltic region"" , ""Integrating gender issues into development cooperation"" and ""Preparatory actions by the NGOs in the campaign against child abuse"" ."
"In these cases the Commission says: ""No decision has yet been taken"" ."
"We are in the middle of November."
"It will be done, but we will see that as a result of taking decisions so late, especially in preparatory actions, which is what all these lines are, and they are priorities of this Parliament, payments may be removed on the grounds that decisions have not been taken."
"I would like to ask, firstly: Who decides that it will not be done? (given that the political priorities, in my understanding, are set by Parliament)."
"And secondly: what is the reason for this delay in the taking of decisions?"
"I would recommend an improvement in 2000."
"I do not want to be firmer with you, but I believe it is important, given that we said the 1999 budget was a bridge, not only with regard to funding, but also in the setting down of the political priorities for the new Millennium."
"Lastly, of the three instruments, it is SAB 5 which we are examining today with an additional EUR 202 million in payment appropriations for external actions and these 15 additional posts for OLAF."
"And the Commission proposal states - and the rapporteur is very happy about this - that they will be entirely funded by the EAGGF-Guarantee, since there are appropriations there which will not be used."
"I would ask Parliament to approve the resolution which is short and concise."
"It takes note of SAB 5 and indicates once again that the forecasts for agricultural expenditure have been excessive."
"It is also indicated in this resolution - and this is perhaps the most important point, section 4 - that it asks Parliament to approve the decision to increase the amount of supplementary and amending budget 5/99 by EUR 25 million in payment appropriations intended for the PHARE programme, in accordance, Mrs Schreyer, with the urgent needs of this programme which the Commission has indicated."
"Lastly, I also want to appeal to the Council. I would like to ask the Council to approve without amendments this SAB 5, amended by Parliament, so that the payments are not subject to further delays."
"Mr President, the very first thing I would like to do is thank the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, very much indeed for this report on the Commission 's fifth supplementary and amending budget, and make it known that it meets with our approval."
"You may find it astonishing that a fifth supplementary and amending budget is being put forward here, at the end of this financial year."
"I would like to remind you though that Parliament, or rather the European Union as a whole, have, in recent years, developed the Notenboom procedure to such an extent that the carry-overs were practically indecipherable by the end of the year, and that we pressed for doing this by means of supplementary and amending budgets, in order to achieve greater transparency."
"And look what is happening: the number is rising all the time."
"I think though, that this has enabled us to bring about greater openness and also a situation that lends itself more readily to scrutiny."
"It will not surprise you to learn that I am particularly keen to talk about OLAF and the fifteen additional posts."
"OLAF, which came into operation on 1 July this year, thereby disbanding UCLAF, the previous anti-fraud office, is a new body and we want to do everything we can to make it run efficiently."
"I assume that this is something that is a major matter of concern for the Commission every bit as much as it is for the other institutions, which are at present still engaged in deciding on accession via the interinstitutional agreement."
"Originally, amending budget 4/1999 provided for 15 posts for OLAF, which was to have a total of 300 posts."
"A total of 120 posts that were part of what used to be UCLAF - I will refer to them as posts rather than people - are already at the disposal of OLAF and we must now consolidate this position with all haste."
"That is why we were most disappointed that people took so much convincing when it came to adding a further fifteen posts to the fifteen provided for in the supplementary and amending budget 4/1999, i.e. a total of 30 for this year."
"I am very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for giving its unequivocal support to the Committee on Budgetary Control in this matter and that we now have these 30 posts for 1999."
"The budget has earmarked 75 posts for the year 2000."
"But the full staffing plan really ought to guarantee that OLAF is fully up and running by 2001 at the latest."
"Mrs Schreyer, I would like to put a few direct questions to you. I believe you have been in touch with the monitoring committee, for which provision has specifically been made to reinforce its secretariat with high-flying personnel."
"This monitoring committee, which is part of OLAF, comprises five independent experts who continue to pursue their normal occupations however."
"They may not be undertaking this work on a voluntary basis - they receive a certain amount of money to cover costs, but this is not payment in the real sense - and they require appropriate support."
"You will have had contact with the monitoring committee by now and in so doing also have allowed yourself to be persuaded that this work is necessary to guarantee the independence of OLAF."
"Yesterday, we decided on the procedure for appointing the director of OLAF in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would like to ask you the following question Mrs Schreyer: on 28 October, I wrote to you to ask if you, indeed the Commission as a whole, could send me official confirmation of the list of eleven candidates for this office."
"I am sorry to say that so far I have not received a reply to this letter."
"I would like to take the opportunity in this plenary sitting to urge you most fervently to provide a response as soon as possible."
"As soon as possible means that I am counting on it being this week - and I want to make that very plain - so that we can get the official referral under way, so as to enable us to make progress here in Parliament."
"The Council is putting pressure on, as is Parliament."
"And so should the Commission, so that there is still time for us to appoint the director before the end of this year."
"I would urge you, if you are able, to undertake to have the official referral together with the list of eleven candidates, forwarded to us straightaway."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would expressly like to thank Mrs Dührkop Dührkop for the excellent work she is doing in the way of follow-up to Budget 2000."
"I believe it has rarely been the case that a rapporteur has had to contend with in excess of 60 carry-overs and five supplementary and amending budgets in the course of one financial year. A multitude of amendments and additions to the original budget plan prompted her to say, in the course of the last discussion we had on supplementary and amending budget 4 that she no longer recognises her own baby, that is to say Budget 1999."
"If what I am about to say has a ring of criticism about it, then it is not directed primarily at you Mrs Schreyer, for you are not the one who has had to take responsibility for this over the past few weeks, but when we as a Parliament draw up a budget at the end of a year, i.e. in the autumn, then we take for granted the fact that we are setting priorities in this budget and that these priorities are also the ones that will actually be applied in the course of the budgetary procedure and will be put into practice. Put another way, we assume that the things we consider to be important will actually be implemented in the form of policies."
"What we are in fact seeing is this budget being amended rather drastically for the fifth time."
"I am aware that we requested that the budget be amended a fifth time, directly on account of OLAF, and we stand by this, but all the same we must ask ourselves whether there is any point in setting priorities in the course of budgetary negotiations if they are only going to be revoked at a later date."
"Here is an example from last year: ultimately, the Committee on Budgets and also Parliament pushed very hard for a line covering aid for Armenia and Georgia to be increased."
"We were aware that not everyone was in agreement with this but pushed it through nonetheless."
"What we have found to be the case is that in the course of this year the additional three million that we earmarked were not used at all, rather they were completely dispensed with because the measures could not be implemented or because the decision was taken not to implement them."
"That is our problem."
"In future, we would like to know - and this is why we intend to monitor implementation more closely than before - what becomes of our priorities?"
"We intend to ask you repeatedly in the course of the year what has actually happened in certain cases."
"This is also a task that we will entrust to our committees when we say to them: when you outline policies and literally follow our every move in the course of the budgetary procedure and say we need another EUR 100,000 there, for example, then would you please continue to follow matters up when it comes to implementation."
"I am also directing this comment at our own committees."
"It is not enough just to make one' s presence felt here in the budgetary procedure."
"What we have done in the course of the last few years is to incorporate an ever increasing amount of reserves into the budget in order to be able to improve control and become more heavily involved in implementation."
"But that truly cannot be the right way of going about things!"
"Allow me also to direct a comment at the Commission on the subject of SAB5: you are of course aware that we were a new Parliament, - and I really must make our disapproval very plain at this juncture, as we approach the end of the year - yet still you introduced a supplementary budget in the summer recess, when we were completely unable to react to it because the new Parliament was not up and running at that stage."
"That is no way to behave!"
"It is our intention - and you can rely on this being the case - to keep a very close eye indeed on this in future, that is to say on how you behave towards us and what prospect there is of us actually living up to our responsibilities."
"There is one more thing I would like to say as what I have said so far relates to the current budgetary procedure."
"We are now embarking on very difficult negotiations and there are figures in the frame again which none of us are very confident will actually form a sound basis."
"We concluded an interinstitutional agreement at the beginning of this year which was to strengthen people' s faith in cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"If this faith is to be justified, then what we produce in consequence of our decisions and in our discussions must have a firm basis."
"I want to make that very plain and make specific reference to the figures that have been placed before us for Kosovo."
"We must have very reliable figures for this, otherwise we will be constructing a budget that will grind to a halt in the course of next year."
"This would mean us having to reallocate and redistribute from left to right again something in the order of hundreds of millions, and a budgetary procedure cannot be used to this end!"
"We want there to be a firm basis now; we want it to be made plain that the situation in Kosovo has gone on for several years now and that we must work together on this for several years to come."
"We want there to be a firm basis that is long-lasting."
"For we are not justified in undertaking an infinite number of reallocations and carry-overs and supplementary budgets when this gives the impression that we did not make a good enough job of our work to begin with."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, as is customary, for her good report concerning SAB 5/99."
"In addition to Mrs Dührkop' s report, we have already heard the debates on the issues of own resources and budgetary discipline and the truth is that none will be of any advantage to the tax-payer unless we improve the efficiency of the campaign against fraud."
"Mrs Theato has just commented very effectively on the fact that we have replaced UCLAF with OLAF. We are debating how to find the most suitable director."
"But none of this is of any use if we do not provide OLAF with the necessary resources. Therefore, I am pleased that by means of this supplementary and amending budget of EUR 202 million the new posts can be increased from 15 to 30 and that, furthermore, it should be done this time with the agreement of the Council."
"Every day, OLAF is having to deal with an increasing number of problems. Every day, the geographic area is increasing and I therefore believe that every day, OLAF must be provided with sufficient means, both in terms of personnel and of material means, so that it may attend to the new issues."
"For example, I believe that one of the parts which has still not been sufficiently studied is the proportionality of fines: I am referring to the fact that the worst fraud should be punished with the greatest fine."
"We also lack knowledge of the details when a fine is lowered or waived."
"Therefore, I have always said - and I repeat it here today - that in order to move forward, good will is not enough, but we also need the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to move in the same direction."
"And, as in this case, to be able to count on a strong and effective OLAF which will benefit the European tax-payer."
"Mr President, this supplementary and amending budget 5/99 is an important step towards ensuring that the new anti-fraud office, OLAF, will soon have the power to act."
"I welcome the fact that the expert recommendations provided by the OLAF monitoring committee were also taken full account of on this occasion."
"This was not always the case, as we have heard."
"This has been put right, which is good for OLAF."
"It underlines our desire to secure OLAF' s independence."
"The decision as to how these posts are to be filled will lie with the future director of OLAF."
"Last night, the Committee on Budgetary Control established a hearings procedure for the candidates."
"It is our intention to compile a list of three names which the President of our House will then be able to decide on in concert with the Council and the Commission."
"As such, we are following the recommendations provided by our Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"What we still need from the Commission though, in order to be able to start the process - and I agree with Mrs Theato here and am specifically addressing this comment to you Mrs Schreyer - is a formal decision on the candidates to be considered for the post."
"There were 450 applicants."
"The OLAF monitoring committee whittled this down to a list of 11 names."
"Vice-President Kinnock and you yourself informed us that the competent services of the Commission have endorsed the monitoring committee' s vote."
"As far as I know, however, the Commission has not yet reached a formal decision itself and rumour even has it that the Commission is to decide on a list today that now comprises only four names."
"Would you be so kind as to correct me if I am wrong."
"It is quite clear that such a decision would be in violation of the OLAF Regulation, which sets out that you as a Commission, require a positive statement from the monitoring committee."
"Parliament and the Council decided that this is how it should work, so as to ensure that the new director would be independent of the Commission."
"But you only have a positive statement of this kind for the list of 11, not for a list featuring more names and not for one featuring fewer names either."
"I am not nit-picking; the point is that as this process unfolds, it must be beyond all doubt."
"Particularly in view of the incidents of the last few months and the crisis in the Commission, it would, to my mind, be a severe handicap if the new director were to be appointed without EEC legislative procedure having been fully complied with."
"Mr President, I would like to reply to Mrs Schreyer, in a general way, on the comments we made."
"Mrs Schreyer, I believe that you will have been able to deduce - from these and also from my intervention in September - that we are very concerned about the need to rectify and reassign the amounts within the budget itself."
"Mrs Schreyer, I would like to ask you a simple question: has the Commission, given what we have heard here in September and today, addressed the question of how, in the budget for 2000, we can avoid the situation whereby, in the middle of November, we are still producing a supplementary, amending and transferring budget?"
"And a final question: is there anything else on the waiting list before the end of the year for the 1999 budget?"
"As rapporteur, I would like to know."
"Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, this fifth letter of amendment for the budget of 1999 is in accordance with the directives proposed in May in budgetary conciliation."
"The means of payment for the PHARE and TACIS programmes, for former Yugoslavia and for the macro-economic aid for Macedonia can now be increased, that is to say they can now be safeguarded."
"As such, account is also being taken of the negative effects that the Kosovo conflict and the Kosovo war had on the situation in Macedonia, among other things, and we can at last come up with the budgetary aid this country badly needs and that was promised back in the spring or summer."
"In addition, this letter creates 15 new posts for OLAF and it goes without saying that I would like to address the questions that have been put to me here on the appointment of the director of OLAF."
"It is true: the independent monitoring committee - and I would like to place great emphasis here on the word ""independent"" in the context of the monitoring committee - picked out 11 candidates it considered suitable from the multitude of applications."
"The Commission' s nomination committee then made a selection and I can assure you that at some point today you will receive the list of candidates that the nomination committee deems to be suitable."
"I believe that the procedure can be interpreted in such a way that naturally the Committee on Budgetary Control is at liberty, for its part, to conduct hearings of the 11 candidates and reach a decision."
"I very much hope that the Commission' s procedure and the one you use in your hearings produce similar outcomes."
"In view of the eligibility of the candidates on the list, I am optimistic that it will be possible to find a very good candidate to hold this difficult office."
"I would like to turn again to the matter of carrying appropriations forward."
"Parliament had already transferred EUR 30 million less in the overall carry-over."
"Consequently, the rapporteur proposes increasing the PHARE programme by EUR 25 million now."
"Again, I can assure you, as I also did in the trialogue, that we support this amendment and request the Council to adopt it."
"If this modified supplementary and amending budget is adopted, then it will be possible, in 1999, taking into account all the amendments, to make available and finance an additional EUR 670 million for the PHARE and TACIS programmes, for south-east Europe and other programmes, mainly from unused funds in the agricultural sector."
"All in all, I welcome the fact that it has been possible, on account of this reduction in expenditure, to increase funds in the external action sector."
"Several of you have criticised the fact that carry-overs of this order of magnitude are being proposed, and indeed that it was feasible to do so."
"To this, I would say that surely the reality of budgetary policy is that there will always be developments in the course of a financial year, that is during the handling of a budget, that will debar full exploitation of all the budgetary lines."
"This does not signify a failure on the part of the Commission to accept Parliament' s decisions."
"I will make it my business to see that Parliament' s decisions are adhered to."
"Nevertheless, we will always be faced with situations in which one or other development debars full exploitation of the lines."
"I will inform you whenever it is possible to predict to what extent situations of this kind will arise, and I believe that what we must do then is to jointly consider neither freezing these funds, nor employing them, but rather reallocating them to precisely those areas where Parliament too agrees that this represents constructive use of these surplus funds."
"As I said before, I am absolutely convinced of what a positive development it was that since less money was needed in the agricultural sector, i.e. less money had to be spent, on account of market and pricing trends, this is now available for such urgent and important external action programmes as are detailed in the documents we have before us."
"Mr President, I have a specific question: Mrs Schreyer, you said that the list will be made available to us before the end of today."
"Which list is that?"
"The list of eleven or a list of four?"
"Mr Bösch explained it in great detail."
"I would like to warn of the fact that we are not pursuing the procedures properly."
"They are clearly set out in Regulation 1037/1999 and in the interinstitutional agreement."
"Parliament is not in a position to say ""we will hear eleven "", or if there is another list, ""we will hear four"" !"
"That is not how it works!"
"We cannot afford to open up the possibility of those who were placed on the list by the monitoring committee taking legal action."
"First of all you must reach agreement with the monitoring committee and then you must officially pass the list on to us so that we can then set our own procedure in train, come to an agreement with the Council and then make a proposal to you as regards who to appoint."
"Ultimately therefore, you appoint in name only, but the procedure leading up to this must be conducted properly."
"Could you please tell us exactly which list it is you intend to make available to us today?"
"Mr President, I congratulate you."
"This is a genuine Parliament and we are embarking on a debate."
"I believe that we should be grateful for that."
"Mrs Schreyer, I agree with you and I am very pleased that agricultural expenditure will in fact have to fund this last SAB."
"But I also take you at your word when you say that we are going to take great care in the budget to ensure that the reassignments do not alter the priorities that the European Parliament has set."
"The examples which I gave earlier were, curiously, genuine priorities."
"And I take your word so that in 2000, as part of a joint effort, which is much more intense and much more open, we may from the outset prevent priorities such as the Baltic regions or actions in favour of children from being the first to be affected, because there is a suspicion that it is perhaps not you who do not want to carry them out, but rather other powers which are behind it."
"Mr President, chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, my committee has also debated the matter of how we can guarantee to avoid committing formal errors."
"Of course we have, in the appointment of the director of OLAF, a situation that is new to us."
"A special procedure has been decided on."
"At the same time, the decision does not cover every detail - understandably so I might say - and as such does not map out every single step."
"Therefore, we must handle this together so that the existing procedures, which the Commission regards as formal procedures; i.e. the calling-in of the nomination committee and also Parliament' s right to conduct hearings of the candidates, and the role of the monitoring committee, can be included in the process."
"The Commission now has to hand the recommendation of its nomination committee and this selection was made on the basis of the list of eleven candidates."
"As such, there has therefore been a combination of procedures in this instance."
"I can assure you that I will bring everything we have talked about in today' s discussion on how we are to proceed - you decided yesterday how all this is to be brought into line - into the Commission' s debate."
"All I can say, and I really want to impress this on you again, is that I am very much in favour of us being able to reach this decision before the end of this year."
"It is already relatively late, but the decision ought to be reached this year so as to enable the director to set to work without further delay, and I am actually very optimistic that we will be able to reach a sound decision here, on the basis of an interinstitutional procedure."
"I would like to respond to Mrs Dührkop Dührkop as follows: of course the priorities this Parliament sets in the course of the budgetary process and for the budget itself are guiding principles for the Commission when it comes to the implementation stage of the budget."
"That is why I referred to the fact that you could count on being informed in good time if difficulties should arise."
"When it comes to the examples you have just cited, this is expenditure which I set great store by, I can assure you."
"As such, I will, of course, ensure for my part, that foundations are laid here which will make it possible for this expenditure to actually be deployed."
"But if, on the other hand, savings are made, on account of positive trends say, then there is no reason why we should not put our heads together and decide how this expenditure could be usefully re-deployed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m."
"Environment and Community energy policy"
"The next item is the statement on the report (A5-0039/1999) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament on ""Strengthening environmental integration within Community energy policy"" (COM(1998) 571 - C4-0040/1999)."
"Mr President, both the Maastricht and the Amsterdam Treaties focus on environment protection measures."
"This communication from the Commission takes the issue forward within the energy sector."
"Three objectives have been set out: firstly, to promote energy efficiency; second, to increase the share of production of cleaner energy sources - the target is 12% from renewables by 2010 - third, to reduce the environmental impact of the production and use of energy products."
"Three priorities have been set for integrating these environmental objectives in energy policy."
"First of all, they need to be implemented in a balanced way which takes account of competitiveness and of security of supply."
"Then, they must be realistic and cost-effective."
"Third, they must be flexible in their implementation to take account of rapidly changing markets and technologies."
"Global warming is a major issue but, of course, it is not the only environmental issue that we confront."
"In the energy and transport sectors there are major contributors to global warming emissions."
"We, in Europe, must do our part and set a good example to the rest of the world, while recognising that the major pressure for energy consumption in future will come from countries like the United States, which is rather profligate in its consumption of energy, and also from developing countries which, as their economies grow and they raise their standard of living, will look for more energy consumption, which is likely to come from rather polluting sources of energy."
"The report calls on the Commission to promote best practice, to encourage the exchange of views and experience, to encourage increased public awareness while respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"It must be recognised that energy policy is still determined largely at Member State level."
"But there can be no doubt that energy efficiency is a matter that should be of concern to all of us."
"The report also calls on the Commission to support the process of integrating these environmental objectives in energy policy through research into the impact of climate change, through research into all possible technologies, through research into identifying the best indicators to measure achievements in reducing emissions and through regular reports to Parliament."
"In terms of possible legislative action, this report calls on the Commission to consider amending existing legislation or to introduce new measures which will strengthen those objectives, but it also asks the Commission to follow-up and study the effect of all legislative measures up to now and to report on their full cost and their full effectiveness to Parliament."
"The report also calls for the environmental objectives to be taken into account in the enlargement process."
"There are many concerns about energy consumption and electricity generation in the applicant countries, which need to be addressed."
"The report reminds us that in order to achieve significant improvement in global environmental protection measures and reduction of emissions, we need dialogue and consensus with both our trading competitors and developing countries alike."
"The Commission has made one major omission in not making any mention of nuclear energy in this report."
"Whatever your views on this source of power and electricity, it is a fact that it supplies a significant part of our electricity in Europe and it does so in a way which does not produce CO2 or other greenhouse gas emissions and that is why - and the only reason - it has been mentioned in this report."
"It would be a mistake for this reference to nuclear energy to distract attention from the main thrust of this report, which is about improving energy efficiency, drawing more supply from renewable sources, and integrating our environmental objectives in our energy policy."
"It is a good start and there is much more to do."
"Mr President, thank you very much. Parliament has taken receipt of a report on this subject produced under the tutelage of Mr Chichester and I would like to congratulate him on it."
"It is a good report. Another way in which the European Union seeks to further environmental policy in the field of energy is by setting up programmes promoting the efficiency of installations."
"But I want to again make clear today that the most important environmental policy measure we have taken to date was when we abolished the monopolies and introduced competition in the directives on gas and electricity of 1996 and 1998."
"For it is only under such circumstances that the former monopolies are forced to shut down all their unprofitable installations and pass the consequences of this onto the consumer in terms of costs."
"Only now do they have an incentive to operate their installations as efficiently as possible."
"I also want to draw your attention to one aspect in particular."
"It is only when a sector opens up to competition that variable rates can be set, something we are all familiar with in the case of the telecommunications sector."
"Variable rates will lead to consumption over a 24 hour period being corrected and as such better use will be made of the installation capacity and fewer installations will be required."
"In other words, it will not be necessary to produce as much energy and that is the most significant contribution to environmental policy to come out of these directives."
"Hence the observation, incidentally, that the deliberations put forward by the previous Commission on the so-called integrated resources planning - an expression I really dislike - will die a death for this very reason, because there is no need for regulation."
"For the energy suppliers and distributors will endeavour of their own accord to manage demand appropriately."
"When it came to adopting the directives, the PPE Group stressed that as far as we were concerned there was still a lack of harmonisation of environmental policies."
"That is why we have this report before us today, and we await further initiatives from the Commission."
"I would also like to remind you that these directives provide for priority regulations with respect to the supply of electricity from renewable energies and combined heat and power systems."
"These will all be of obvious benefit to the environment."
"What we still lack though and what the previous Commission failed to achieve, and what we hope will be achieved in the end, is a European directive which does not just provide for the regulation in technical terms of the supply of electricity from renewable energy, but which also clearly sets out, in accordance with European competition law, models that show how electricity produced by this method can be promoted in a manner which meets Community requirements."
"I see Mr Linkohr sitting just across the way."
"We were unable to support the proposal he put forward at the time in every last detail, but we are agreed on the line of approach, i.e. that European legislation must be drawn up in this area."
"I would also like to say in this context that we are soon to enter into very careful deliberations with the Commission, in Committee, on what else needs to be done in regulatory terms in the field of gas and electricity, for contrary to all declarations, we still do not have a European market, to a large extent we still have 15 individual markets."
"This situation must change!"
"Finally, I would like to make an observation of a rather personal nature."
"Whosoever believes that environmental protection can be achieved by introducing a CO2-tax will find no credence with me at any rate."
"This is a quote from the Secretary-General of the IAEO who recently held forth before us all, stating that he knew of no examples to support the contention that linking taxation with the emission of harmful substances really does make a difference in terms of less energy being used and achieving reductions in the emission of harmful substances."
"Consequently, and until there is evidence to the contrary, I will continue to regard all deliberations in respect of CO2 as nothing more than an increase in taxation by the backdoor, and I personally would only be prepared to support this if other taxes were to be cut in advance, rather than just an announcement made."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Chichester, on his report."
"The Liberal Group agrees with the main thrust of the recommendations in the resolution, except for considerations C and L and sections 4 and 5."
"Mr President, the benefits of nuclear energy are not as undisputed as these sections make them out to be."
"Where nuclear energy helps us achieve our CO2 objectives, it also adds to the environmental problems of nuclear waste, which is completely opposed to the objectives of the communication of the Committee before us, namely a more powerful integration of the environment into the energy policy."
"My second point concerns Amendment No 7 submitted by the Liberal Group with regard to section 1."
"My group is delighted that the rapporteur has accepted this as a supplement."
"Energy policy falls within the principle of subsidiarity but its transnational environmental impact is very much a European concern."
"Since sustainable development has become a Treaty objective, it is only logical to include an energy section in the Treaty which enables an integrated approach to energy and environment."
"This will, however, not lead to higher energy consumption. After all, energy is a high cost item for companies and private people alike and this is set to remain so."
"A further incentive to integrate policies on energy and environment is the introduction of an eco-tax, as is already in place in the Netherlands and Sweden."
"The introduction of an eco-tax may lead to more energy efficiency and, as such, lower energy consumption."
"My group calls on the committee and Member States to introduce such a tax in a coordinated manner, thus avoiding unfair competition within the Union. Needless to say, this tax should not add any extra cost to the European citizen."
"The most vital requirement of energy and environmental policy as we approach the millennium is to meet our Kyoto commitments, and here of course a CO2 tax would have a major role to play."
"Unfortunately, that has not yet been agreed, but we would ask the Commission to proceed in this direction."
"We are not in fact meeting our energy commitments under Kyoto at all."
"Energy conservation, rational planning and renewable energies are agreed to be the most important way forward other than the CO2 tax, about which, as I have said, no agreement has yet been reached."
"They are indeed the right way to sustainability, but we are not pursuing them strongly enough."
"The most recent statistics on energy intensity show that for 1996 we are at level zero."
"We are in fact going backwards after seven years of trying to meet climate change commitments: this is not only unacceptable, it is completely scandalous."
"I would refer you to those statistics - I am sure you know what they are, and we have to do better."
"Our citizens expect and, indeed, demand that we do better."
"The Commission and Parliament have indeed together sought to keep the already small budget for SAVE and ALTENER on target and for that I thank you and I hope we can continue to make progress."
"What does not have a place in energy and the environment is nuclear power because it is not sustainable."
"We do not have the ability to deal with nuclear waste although various fancy solutions have been proposed, including sending it to the moon, and we would be indeed on another planet if we agreed with Mr Chichester that nuclear power was a solution."
"It is not, and I think that he was very ill-advised to add this discordant note to an otherwise more or less acceptable report."
"I also feel that the Commission was most wise to avoid reference to nuclear power in its own proposals and I would advise you to keep to this approach because it is a most divisive thing to propose, and we will certainly not agree to it."
"The recent nuclear accident in Japan has exposed once again the criminal negligence of the nuclear industry, and the recent falsifications of safety checks by BNFL at Sellafield are further evidence that we need to have great anxiety about the nuclear industry and how it operates."
"What do we want, and what is the way forward?"
"We want the implementation of commitments in the White Paper on renewable energies, for example."
"We want these commitments fleshed out by a Commission action plan on renewable energies."
"Reference has been made to the internal market, and this is the most important environment in which we now operate: here the large subsidies for coal and nuclear energy must be ended and support for renewables as an important aspect of environmental policy must be made realistic."
"Legally-binding targets for renewable energies are an important part of this strategy, but we must also have very clearly the externalisation of internal costs in respect of traditional energy production."
"Finally, I think that if we have a level playing field and if we end the subsidies particularly for nuclear energy, we will see the other forms of energy coming forward."
"Mr President, energy is at the heart of any economic or social activity."
"All citizens are affected by the supply, transportation and distribution of energy."
"There is still a lot to be done to ensure that the right to energy is a reality everywhere, both in the poorest countries and in industrialised countries, where all classes of the population do not have access on equal terms: needs are not therefore being satisfied and energy-related issues are becoming crucial."
"The European Union is still highly dependent on energy."
"CO2 emissions have not yet been stabilised and energy sources have not yet been diversified."
"Designing an energy policy which respects the environment therefore requires determined effort."
"In this respect, the fifth UN Conference on Climate Change has just confirmed the divergences between those with pro-active policies and those who are continually attempting to circumvent the Kyoto targets."
"The European Union is itself undertaking to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the year 2002 and is campaigning for measures which are different for developing countries and for industrialised countries."
"Its CO2 emissions were reduced by 19% in 1997."
"In this way it may contribute, I believe, to preventing the Americans' exclusively commercial liberal concept gaining the day, a concept which goes as far as to call into question the Kyoto targets."
"Yet, Europe has not made sufficient effort, and there is no guaranteed response to all these challenges."
"There is, therefore, cause for concern in the fact that the Commission and the Council continue to regard opening the energy market to free competition as an essential phase."
"As the Chichester report indeed observes, there is a contradiction between liberalisation and the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"But this is not the only contradiction."
"Market pressure is also exerted on public service tasks: the most effective centres of resistance to unbridled free competition and public enterprises are under threat."
"Furthermore, the call for competition restricts the capacity of States to intervene in energy policy choices and to guarantee equal access for users."
"Energy is not like other goods for sale and must be treated as a special case."
"Greater cooperation and the coordination of national policies are required, not an integrated European policy."
"Finally, the rapporteur is astonished, rightly so, that the Commission makes no mention whatsoever of nuclear energy even though it contributes towards reducing CO2 emissions, even if this energy should be safer and more environmentally friendly."
"Such key issues merit extensive public debate, enabling everyone to come to terms with the challenges and choices involved in energy policy."
"At the outset I want to compliment Mr Chichester on the preparation and presentation of this report."
"The Commission' s communication on strengthening environmental integration within Community energy policy is very welcome in view of its realistic approach to the question."
"Sustainable development is not just a lofty aim, it is an obligation imposed by the Treaties and must therefore form the central principle of any future European energy policy and at the same time a balance must be struck."
"Certain clear targets have already been set by the Union in the energy field to reduce CO2 emissions by 8% by the middle of the next decade and of course to double the contribution of renewable energy sources from the current 6% to 12% by 2010."
"The efforts at Community level complement those of Member States."
"In my own country, Ireland, for example, EUR 160 m are to be spent on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector."
"With the combined efforts of the Community and the Member States which have primary responsibility for energy policy, I believe that these targets can be attained."
"We must be careful to allow sufficient flexibility to take account of the necessary adjustment of the energy market while in transition, and for this reason our targets must remain realistic and proposals must remain open as to details."
"Mr Chichester recognises the limited role Parliament can play in energy policy, given that it is essentially a Member State competence."
"We do have a clear and consistent voice when it comes to environmental matters, and the environmental considerations of energy generation are self-evident and considerable."
"I support initiatives at European level which contribute to the efforts of Member States to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector."
"We recently voted to renew the same programme with increased funding and this will make a valuable contribution to Member States' efforts."
"In conclusion, I believe that much can be learned from an exchange of views between Member States on energy policy, and I support Mr Chichester' s call for the Commission to highlight examples of best practice in integrating environmental objectives in the energy policy."
"Mr President, I would like first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, especially on his skill in extracting the nuclear issue from this report."
"But, apart from that, like him I believe that the problem that Parliament has is that we cannot find the right time to tackle the matter of energy policy in a general and in-depth fashion."
"This is due to the omissions in the Treaty, and also perhaps to Parliament itself."
"In fact, with the recent preparation of a report on renewable energy sources, what we can see is a piecemeal approach to this issue, which nonetheless is a fundamental issue: once again, I agree with the rapporteur and with many of the speakers."
"As regards this report, we cannot restrict it to the environmental impact related to CO2."
"It is a very important aspect of the problem but, as Mr Belder and other speakers have said, there are many other aspects, in particular the nuclear issue, which have an ecological impact and which must be dealt with."
"The problem also involves the appropriations."
"Lacking a single policy on energy, the European Union is proliferating appropriations, especially those for research."
"This is evidence that even today there is a hidden policy to promote nuclear power, which is no longer tolerable, in my opinion."
"The 12% renewable energy target is totally inadequate and, even despite that, there is a risk that it will not be possible to achieve it."
"It is essential, therefore, to unify the energy debate in order to determine exactly what our investment choices are, and to put an end to the contradictory situation whereby at least five members of the European Union, Austria, Italy, Denmark, Portugal and Greece, who do not actually use nuclear power, are obliged to finance a nuclear policy which is still subsidised, by more than 50%, by the European Union."
"A debate must be initiated, I believe, as a matter of urgency, in order to have real discussion of the matter of energy, and to end the practice of tackling the subject piecemeal, which has been the case until now."
"Mr President, Members of the Commission, although the importance of environmental considerations has grown over the years, the aim of the Union' s energy policy in the future too must be to ensure that Europe' s industrial and household energy supply is kept at a competitive price."
"In meeting this aim, the environment also has its own role to play."
"The environment is, however, not the main objective of an energy policy, - and should not be."
"In recent years, the European Union has done much to achieve a more sustainable energy economy."
"We have committed to a considerable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005."
"We have invested in the increased use of renewable energy resources, and we have expressed our firm desire to take account of the requirements of a sustainable energy economy in the enlargement process."
"At the same time, we must, however, acknowledge that the demands concerning the Union' s energy policy are partly contradictory."
"In connection with this report, there was a wish to discuss nuclear power, and how appropriate a means of production it will be in the future."
"There can be no denying the contradiction there is between the speeches made here opposing nuclear power, which came from at least a couple directions, and the aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"The share of nuclear energy in electricity production must be kept at least at its present level, and it should perhaps even be increased, so that we can achieve the ambitious target for the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, to which all of you, my good friends, including Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mrs Ahern, and everyone else in this House, are committed."
"If we are to take proper account of the environment, this requires that Member States allow sufficiently early on for replacement and renewal investments in their national strategies, this being a matter for decision making at national level."
"Neither can the aim to have a common European energy tax be buried."
"Reform must, however, be based on the notion that there will be no increase in the overall burden of taxation for European industry."
"In this regard, I share the concern of my colleague, Mr Mombaur, that the possible threat of an energy tax should be offset by looking into other forms of taxation for business."
"At the same time, we have to ensure that no model for an energy tax will prevent the very important exploitation of fuel peat in Finland in the future either."
"Mr President, this is an important report and the work of a professional."
"It is, however, very general in nature, and I would like to touch on something fairly concrete in this issue. I thus thought I would speak about gas, and a little about Russia."
"The share of renewable energy in the European Union will have doubled in ten years' time from 6% to 12%, and in reducing carbon dioxide emissions an important and really decisive factor is held to be the development of combined electricity and heat plants using coal and natural gas as fuels."
"In my own country, wood chip energy production from waste wood is now becoming very competitive and important."
"Investigations show that the use of gas is growing in the Union, but at the same time the Union will have run out of this resource in 10 - 20 years' time."
"Russia is our biggest importer, and it is there that the world' s largest deposits of gas are to be found, many of which are located relatively nearby, in northern Russia, Siberia and the Barents Sea region."
"It is predicted that the additional need for gas will be approximately 150 billion cubic metres in 2020, twenty years from now."
"Russia' s gas production will also start declining in a few years' time."
"Production will therefore decline in both the EU and Russia, but our requirements will grow."
"To meet the gas consumption requirement for this region we will perhaps need four or five pipelines of additional gas."
"This is precisely the problem."
"With Russia we have a partnership and cooperation agreement, which cannot be implemented without concrete objectives. At the same time, the situation in Russia is confused, though, hopefully, after the elections it will have recovered to some extent."
"We would have a common target for investment here: gas, which we badly need and whose new production and satellite regions in the north are quite near us."
"In fact it might be said that Russia must turn to its resources in the north as in the south there appears to be an on-going period of fighting and wars."
"In other words, Russia will turn to a region where these problems do not exist."
"The European Union is also offering a cooperative hand in the light of the northern dimension."
"I therefore propose that the Commission take forceful measures in this issue, and, at this stage, I would ask what the Commission has done to resolve the gas issue via Russia."
"Mr President, Mr Chichester has quite rightly stated in his report that environmental considerations must be taken better account of in the Union' s energy policy, but, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States bear the main responsibility for energy policy."
"The environmental dimension must also be included in energy policy at regional and local level."
"That too has been mentioned in this report."
"The recently amended SAVE and Altener programmes are the cornerstones of a sustainable and environment-friendly energy policy."
"Energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources of energy must be stepped up to meet at least the ambitious targets of the Union."
"That will require research, pilot projects, exchange of experience and new technology applications."
"We have to ensure throughout the whole Union area that the networks are also at the disposal of small companies that produce renewable energy."
"The greatest barriers to the increased use of renewable energy and energy saving are attitudes and ignorance."
"For that reason, communications have an important part to play in the promotion of more environment-friendly production and use of energy."
"All this requires money."
"Unfortunately the Union budget sets aside very little funds for the promotion of a sustainable energy policy."
"This amount has to be increased if we mean to keep to our targets."
"The Member States also have to seek bold taxation solutions and other incentives to boost energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable sources of energy."
"Peat, as a renewable energy resource, must also gradually be included in the incentives package."
"The report presents nuclear energy in too favourable a light."
"In my opinion, nuclear power is not the solution to the environmental problems of energy production."
"Nuclear power is still needed, but the safety factors involved and the storage of nuclear waste are still serious problems."
"Mr President, it is extremely important that arrangements be made to introduce environmental considerations into energy policy, and I therefore welcome the Commission' s announcement."
"The Kyoto objectives confront us with a significant challenge, and sustainability ought to be a general principle for the development of future energy policy."
"Nuclear power is not the solution."
"This form of energy might enable CO2 emissions to be reduced but, at the same time, it creates very many new environmental problems."
"For the same reason, I support Amendment No 8 which is about giving due weight to the precautionary principle."
"It is high time that the EU began to prioritise its own objectives in connection with doubling energy production from renewable energy sources."
"As late as last week, the Commission was ready to submit a proposal for a new EU directive which would have set drastic limits upon national subsidies for renewable energy sources."
"Now, the proposal has fortunately been withdrawn, partly because of Denmark' s commendable readiness to sound the alarm."
"The directive established a situation in which it would be open to producers in all EU countries to supplement national subsidies for over and above the first 5% of energy from plant which uses renewable energy sources."
"In practice, a proposal of this kind would have meant that the use of renewable energy sources would not have increased beyond 5% for there is no finance minister in any country who would want to finance the development of projects in other countries."
"In that way, the Danish energy plan, the aim of which is that 20% of the energy supply should come from renewable energy sources by the year 2003, would have run into major problems."
"I hope therefore that, when it comes up with a new proposal, the Commission will read its own announcement concerning the increased weight to be given to environmental considerations in the Community' s energy policy and that it will actively help ensure that more use is made of renewable energy sources."
"Mr President, environmental considerations are very important in the field of energy and that is why I would like to thank Mr Chichester warmly for his report, which addresses the right questions in substance."
"Approximately 50% of our energy requirement in Europe is met by mineral oil and 25% by gas, which means that ¾ of our energy currently derives from fossil energy sources."
"If we take as read that we import more than 50% of the European Union' s total energy requirement then we definitely need to ask ourselves the following question: how can we guarantee reliability of supply in the face of climate change, which in view of the worldwide CO2 problem may, indeed will affect us, not just if there is a failure to take preventive action on our part, but, above all, if there are changes in the political climate?"
"Speaking of changes in the political climate, I would like to point out that we are extremely dependent on certain regions."
"39% of the gas we use has to be imported and 41% of this comes from the CIS States."
"Gas consumption is experiencing very rapid growth in the European Union and energy imports to the European Union are still rising at a rate of 0.9% per annum."
"We have made good progress where the environment is concerned."
"CO2 levels are constant to rising slightly, we achieved a 30% reduction in SO2 levels between 1990 and 1994 and a 9% reduction in the case of NOx."
"Nuclear power cannot be the answer to our problems."
"That is why the Austrian delegation intends to abstain when it comes to consideration L and section 5."
"Increasingly, nuclear energy is being replaced by gas."
"That is why we consider reliability of supply in this sector to be paramount and also why Parliament does not intend to give way in the negotiations with the Council on ALTENER and SAVE - that is to say with EUR 81 million and EUR 68 million."
"We need reliability of supply, we need competitive energy!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is with great satisfaction that I receive the Commission communication on the inclusion of environmental aspects in the energy policy, even if, like many people, I must deplore the serious delays which have arisen in this field in Europe."
"In fact, many Member States, with jurisdiction in this area, have too often chosen to overlook this issue, resulting in real ecological disasters."
"For all that, now that the requirement has been established, apparently with general consensus, the problem of implementation arrangements remains and, here, the task of reconciling the policies proposed is far from being as easy."
"It is a source, indeed, of a great deal of disagreement, on a par with any of the challenges which the European Union must meet."
"As far as I, and others, of course, are concerned, the main challenges are as follows."
"Firstly there is the challenge of the safety of our power supplies and the energy dependence of the European Union, a dependence which is going to grow and which is likely, we are told, to reach 70% in the year 2020, with all the consequent political risks."
"Next, there is the commitment made at Kyoto to reduce CO2 emissions by 8% relative to their 1990 level."
"Confronted with these two challenges, there are some arguing in favour of the all-nuclear solution, while others are arguing in favour of completely giving up nuclear power."
"Personally, I do not think that either of these two extremes offers the solution to environment protection."
"I would be more in favour of a balanced development of energy sources, retaining the nuclear share but especially developing renewable energies."
"The European Union has set the target of increasing the share of renewable energies from 6% to 12% by the year 2010, but the financial resources must be found for this and, today, we are a long way off, to judge by the latest discussion in the Conciliation Committee."
"A further challenge, an absolutely major one, is related to the contradiction, a particularly serious contradiction, I feel, between the liberalisation of energy networks, which, while it certainly affords a certain reduction in prices, also, by the same token, favours waste, and the promotion of rational and economic energy use."
"To the pro-liberals I say that it is necessary to recognise that the market does not solve all problems and ultraliberalism has negative effects."
"In order to meet these challenges and overcome these contradictions, what we need, very quickly, is cooperation at every level, in the Member States and with candidate countries, to enlist the assistance of candidate countries and to work within the terms of the fifth framework programme."
"The rapporteur has done an excellent job and has produced some excellent proposals."
"I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate him on this."
"Mr President, I am liberal but not ultra-liberal."
"Questions relating to energy and the environment must be seen in context, and methods of obtaining energy must be framed in a balanced and well-judged way."
"Because almost all energy production and use has a negative effect on the environment, energy policy must also be seen as an important part of environmental policy."
"Good access to energy sources is a prerequisite of our well-being and of jobs and development."
"The way in which we adapt our methods of obtaining energy must therefore take account of Europe' s need for growth and increased employment."
"It is quite clear that if nuclear power and access to nuclear energy are handled in an irresponsible way, this will seriously damage both Europe' s opportunities for growth and its ability to deal successfully with what is, in my view, the most serious threat to the environment, namely climate changes due to increasing carbon dioxide emissions."
"Let us therefore stop burying our heads in the sand in the belief that the problems involved in adapting our methods of obtaining energy will disappear."
"The rapid phasing-out of nuclear power, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, a better environment, continued well-being and economic power - these are not all of a piece."
"Mr Chichester' s report is mainly characterised by a holistic vision which I am convinced must be present in policy concerning energy and the environment."
"One additional point, however: a common environmental tax for the whole of Europe must become a reality."
"This will be required."
"Finally, the unsafe and, in certain cases, downright dangerous nuclear power stations in Central and Eastern Europe must be closed down very quickly."
"It is unusually bad policy to close down properly operating nuclear power stations in the Member States, necessitating a replacement source of power involving increasing carbon dioxide emissions, at the same time as retaining a form of nuclear power which constitutes a serious environmental threat to the whole of our continent."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Chichester on his positive and constructive report on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament on strengthening environmental integration within Community energy policy."
"I would also like to thank all the Members of Parliament who have participated in this debate for their constructive and positive contributions."
"At the Helsinki Summit, which will take place in December, the Heads of Government will deal with the issue of environmental integration and sustainable development in different policy areas, and especially energy."
"Therefore today' s debate is particularly appropriate."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that it is precisely the energy sector which has been the first to draw up a communication on environmental integration in its policy."
"This reflects the significant role which it has to play given the environmental challenges which face us."
"The energy sector has made a substantial contribution to improving air quality on a local and regional level as compared to previous practices."
"The directive on large combustion plants with regard to the reduction of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and the Auto Oil programme to deal with the problem of air quality in cities, are good examples."
"I would like to highlight the existing cooperation between the energy and environmental sectors."
"This confirms that there are ways of strengthening integration and, as a result, establish environmental quality standards at a cost which will not affect European competitiveness, which is an issue that should always be taken into account."
"This cooperation is particularly important in the light of the challenge presented by climate change."
"Energy continues to occupy a significant place in the preparation of international negotiations for the application of the Kyoto Protocol."
"As a whole, the Commission receives the opinions of Parliament very favourably."
"The insistence on the need to influence the instincts of the people and the habits of the consumer and to establish channels of communication with the citizens and small and medium-sized businesses confirms the importance which political leadership will have with regard to changing our consumer habits and promoting sustainable development."
"As I often point out, we have to start by providing an example, by way of public facilities and public buildings, and by way of the public sector and the institutions, of how energy can be used in a more efficient and rational way."
"Technology will play an important role, but the establishment of new and more demanding environmental standards will depend on the support of the citizens."
"The search for cleaner and more viable technologies is one of the Commission' s main ambitions."
"The resolution of Parliament reminds all of us of the external dimension, that is to say, the process of enlargement and relations with non-EU countries, especially the developing countries; it requires that we adopt a realistic, balanced and flexible approach to the development of policies, which is especially important when it comes to examining the combination of energy sources and its evolution over time."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament that it is necessary to adopt a broad approach in order to promote the use of energy sources with low carbon content in order to satisfy demand."
"In our programmes, we insist on renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"These demand policies are a central pillar of our sustainable approach to energy policy aimed at addressing the major environmental concerns of our citizens."
"Parliament also requests that we attend to the sector which has not received all the attention it deserves."
"That is to say the development of the capacity to separate and store CO2, which is an option which should be studied in depth."
"In conclusion, Mr President, we receive this resolution favourably."
"It reminds us of the true definition of a form of development which can be maintained over time; a sustainable development."
"The human dimension of our policies should also be borne in mind."
"And we must carefully analyse the economic and social consequences of our political decisions in the energy and environment sectors."
"And to sum up, Mr President, several speakers have referred to a broader debate which would take into account all the issues, not only demand and environmental issues but also the question of energy sources and energy dependency based on the forecasts."
"Undoubtedly, this is a debate which we will have to lend all our attention to, and I hope that, throughout the coming months and, of course, before the end of this Commission' s mandate, we will be able to fully develop it, transparently, intensely and effectively in the discussions, as has been the case with the discussion of this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes, that is at 12 p.m."
"Mr President, I have learnt that the services of Parliament - I do not know whether this was under the instructions of the President - have prohibited a press conference by the President of the Court of Auditors of the European Union on this Parliament' s premises."
"I would like to register a strong protest, on behalf of my group."
"I believe that this type of behaviour towards the President of another European institution is an outrage and an affront to this House."
"I request that my protest be communicated to the President and I expect explanations with regard to it."
"I will ensure that your remarks are passed on."
"I personally have no information about this but I will ensure that the President is informed of your concern."
"Normally it is the Quaestors who give permission or not for such meetings so I do not know the situation."
"Mr President, I would like to confirm that, once again, the Radical Members will not be taking part in the vote."
"As you all know, this is because we intend to protest against our inferior position in terms of parliamentary rights and the right to take the floor."
"I hope that this House will not start to think of our interventions as an annoying habit, or even something to be treated superficially and with amusement."
"I think that it would be a serious situation if Parliament were to get used to conditions of continuing discrimination against some of its Members. And a sign from the Presidency that they are paying attention and are sensitive to this matter that we are constantly raising would not go amiss either."
"Mr President, I support what Mr Cappato said."
"As a member of the Italian Socialist Movement, I too am continuing to abstain from voting in support of the Members' fight for freedoms and for improved conditions in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament."
"I therefore declare that I will be abstaining from voting for the whole of the parliamentary term, in line with the Radical Members."
"Vote"
"Before the vote, I would ask the Commission to give its position on the amendments."
"De Palacio, Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, the Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4 and 8."
"Furthermore, the Commission can accept, in principle, Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 9, pending certain clarifications and some reworking of its wording."
"There are only three amendments, Amendments Nos 1, 5 and 10, which are not acceptable to the Commission."
"This is basically the Commission' s position."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/1999) by Mr Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 88/77/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from diesel engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles (5734/1/1999 - C5-0028/1999 - 1997/0350(COD))"
"President."
"Again, I give the floor to the Commission to comment on the amendments."
"Mr President, as Commissioner Liikaanen indicated yesterday in the debate on Mr Lange' s report, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, first part, 6, 7 10, 16 to 26 and 29 to 47."
"It can accept in principle, but subject to further reworking, Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 13, 12 - the two parts of Amendment No 12 - and 15."
"It does not agree with the contents of Amendment No 2, Amendment No 3, section 2, nor Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11, 14, 27 or 28."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Report (A5-0039/99) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament on strengthening environmental integration within Community policy (COM(1998)571 - C4-0040/1999)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"- I respect the reasons for which the British delegation has abstained on Amendments Nos 5 and 8 - junior doctors - but I have not followed this line since firstly, this is a negotiating position and secondly, my close family experience of a highly stressed and overworked NHS midwife do not allow me to impose long working hours on vital medical staff for any longer than is absolutely necessary."
"- Perhaps I should start with a historical, not current, declaration of interest on why I have voted in favour of Amendment No 5, Article 1(6), concerning junior doctors."
"My husband, Dr Rhys Jenkins, currently a GP and working restricted hours, has in the past worked in excess of 100 hours a week whilst training to become a doctor."
"This first-hand knowledge has highlighted for me the dangers of requiring doctors to work such long hours."
"This potentially endangers the lives of patients and certainly can have a detrimental effect on doctors' health."
"I believe that a much delayed and staggered transition such as that proposed by the Council of Ministers is unnecessary and inappropriate."
"In addition there is a particularly acute problem in Wales where the British Medical Association calculates that 30% of junior doctors are working longer than the recommended 40 hours a week."
"The figure in Scotland by comparison is calculated at 10%."
"There is a huge problem in terms of recruitment in the profession, and a haemorrhaging of trained doctors to other countries due to the excessive working hours."
"- Commissioner Byrne, at his hearing stated that: the future of public health policies should not be linked only to the present crisis of the day; that there must be a high level of human health protection in all Community policies; that we must be proactive in public healthcare."
"I repeated these words to the junior doctors of Ireland who, by the way, work the longest hours of any in their profession in the EU."
"They were greatly encouraged by them."
"In light of Commissioner Byrne' s statements, let us look at the words of the Permanent Working Group of European Junior Doctors: ""Research demonstrates that sustained wakefulness such as that experienced by junior doctors (working excessive hours), reduces performance to a level similar to excessive alcohol consumption."""
"These totally unacceptable conditions not only undermine the health of our junior doctors, they also undermine our health care system and endanger the patient."
"I call on my own Irish Government to support this working time directive in line with the rapporteur' s suggestions."
"I also call on the Commission to support Commissioner Byrne as he strives to be pro-active in public healthcare by ensuring that patient care and the health and training of non-consultant hospital doctors is protected."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the Smet report on changing certain aspects of the organisation of working time."
"We think it is a good idea that those employees who have not to date been covered by the Working Time Directive should now be so."
"We have declined to vote for Amendment No 6 from the Committee."
"We agree that the reference period for offshore work may be extended to 12 months."
"A shorter period might compromise safety because it would involve more flights to and from the oil platform."
"Consideration has also to be given to the welfare of employees on the oil platform, where there is very little space."
"We think it is important that the social partners in the labour market should be involved in such important questions as the organisation of working time."
"We think, however, that EU legislation must respect the structures and traditions in the national labour markets."
"We cannot therefore vote in favour of this proposal from the Committee."
"We have voted against Amendment No 7 from the Committee."
"The background to our doing so is that this proposal removes the Member States' freedom to choose whether to regulate employees' hours on the basis either of working time or rest time, as established in ILO Convention no 180 concerning seafarers' working hours."
"We think that sea fishermen will be able to achieve better protection if working time or rest time is regulated on a daily or weekly basis, as proposed by the Council, rather than by having a fixed limit of 48 hours in a reference period of 12 months."
"- The European Parliamentary Labour Party abstained on Amendments Nos 5, 7 and 8 to the Smet report on the Working Time Directive."
"Although the EPLP is committed to the extension of the WTD to the excluded sectors, it understands the need for this to be done in a rational way."
"We are committed to reducing the working hours of junior doctors, but it is essential that this is done in a planned and structured way which does not undermine patient care."
"This directive will require an adequate transposition period with staged reductions in working time."
"The fishing industry required flexibility."
"This amendment does not recognise the reality of the needs of the fishing industry and will adversely effect it."
"- (FR) We are now finally making good an omission dating from 1993, the year when the working time directive was adopted."
"This legislation represented definite progress but at the same time its application excluded six million workers."
"This included personnel involved in the transport sector, but also in work at sea (offshore workers, in particular, and ""doctors in training"" )."
"It was no longer acceptable to exclude these workers in so far as the nature of their work was no different to that of the workers covered by the terms of the directive."
"The proposal under discussion today is intended to rectify the current situation."
"There have been fierce discussions, especially on the question of the ""offshore"" sector and doctors in training."
"Regarding the latter, the European Commission' s initial proposal was that the application of the directive should be extended to doctors in training over a transitional period of seven years."
"We demanded that this period should be reduced to four years, with a maximum weekly working time of fifty-four hours (subject to negotiation) during that time."
"This is the minimum that may be asked if the nature of this profession is taken into account. It is the welfare of these doctors at work, and the health and safety of their patients, which is at stake!"
"This is why the Council' s common position on this, envisaging a nine-year transitional period, would be unacceptable!"
"Regarding offshore workers, we have demanded that working hours may be expressed by an annual figure subject only to collective wage agreements or employer-employee agreements."
"This condition shall have to be reconsidered taking into account the health and safety of workers within a period of five years after the directive comes into force."
"The organisation of working time and the improved reconciliation of working life and private life which it affords must be of benefit to the majority."
"This is the condition on which we may start talking about Social Europe."
"It is more than time for this."
"Recommendation for 2nd reading by Mr Lange (A5-0043/1999)"
"- (FR) I am abstaining from the vote on Mrs Smet' s report, which envisages limiting the working hours of doctors in training, even if it does represent some slight progress in relation to the current situation."
"The fact is, I find it shocking that a transitional period is envisaged, even if it is less than that proposed by the Commission."
"As far as I am concerned, I cannot see any objection to the measure being applied with immediate effect."
"I am even more shocked by the fact that the road transport sector is excluded from the scope of the directive to limit working hours, and by the conditions stipulated for offshore workers in this matter."
"Report by Mr Chichester (A5-0060/1999)"
"Emissions from heavy goods vehicles are contributing more and more to carbon dioxide emissions due to the increasing number of consignments."
"Our aim by means of this report is to reduce emissions of this kind in order to contribute to cleaner air."
"In order to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, we must take decisions involving difficult commitments for industry, above all when it comes to carbon dioxide emissions."
"That is one of the purposes of this report."
"We are aware that the decision may be felt to be onerous for certain manufacturers."
"It is nonetheless our conviction that Swedish industry, with its considerable technical know-how, is well placed to cope with these demands within the time frame proposed in the report, which is to say by 2006."
"Our understanding is that the proposals in the report are not confined to one particular technology but contain a range of technological solutions to choose from."
"To that extent, the report is neutral from a competition point of view."
"We are convinced that, in the long term, Swedish companies will win out by being well ahead in adapting to environmental demands."
"We are proceeding on the assumption that this judgement is shared by the companies concerned."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we see it as our task to force the pace of such developments."
"- (FR) This proposed amendment of Directive 88/77/EEC is based on the Auto-Oil programme concluded by the European Commission in 1996."
"In this context, Parliament has already had occasion to adopt proposed amendments to a number of directives addressing the technical improvement of engines and fuel quality."
"I would not like us to lose sight of the strategy behind the Auto-Oil programme: the objective is to reduce pollution of the atmosphere connected with vehicle emissions."
"At the second reading stage, it is important for Parliament to clearly distinguish between the elements which it considers a priority and the rest."
"Some might think, perhaps, that it is obvious."
"However, the second reading of a text, referred under the codecision procedure, is all too often an opportunity to enter into a game of one-upmanship against the Council."
"This temptation must be avoided at all cost, for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, the European Parliament is in danger of losing sight of the general objective of the proposal before it."
"Next, if it makes the text less clear, it is weakening its position."
"Finally, it loses its credibility with the people and those directly concerned."
"In presenting his reasons, the rapporteur explains that the amendments adopted at the first reading by the European Parliament have made a significant contribution towards improving the initial Commission proposal."
"He specifies that the Council has, in its common position, taken on board some of Parliament' s significant amendments."
"I fully share this point of view."
"The rapporteur has, however, has started on the path of one-upmanship, and, in supporting 47 amendments, he was taking the risk of causing a delay in the entry into force of the best terms of this text."
"The Council' s common position will make it possible to make real progress regarding pollution related to heavy-duty vehicle traffic."
"I was not in favour of adopting the amendments on which the House had to vote, since this would have delayed the entry into force of this text and thus the implementation of investment and industrial strategies."
"The sooner the directive can come into force, the greater the beneficial effect on the environment."
"Mr President, the Chichester report will certainly have important repercussions on European energy policy."
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities voted in favour, as we are committed to application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Energy is still a strategic and sensitive area for States."
"It is indeed essential to allow them to select and define their policy on the subject, since Europe and in particular the Commission, have only a supporting role rather than a critical role."
"This very realistic report demonstrates unquestionable open-mindedness."
"Nothing is anathematised and no doors are closed, particularly that of nuclear power."
"It lists the various energy sources, seeing them as complementary to, and not replacements for, the forms of energy currently used."
"Realism on the subject of energy makes this necessary."
"All avenues must be explored, none must be ignored or sacrificed."
"The diversity of sources must be acceptable."
"Finally, it is necessary to ensure that the most absolute transparency is applied, while respecting strategic technical safety regulations."
"By means of serious and comprehensive studies and evaluations, everyone will be able to appreciate whether a given choice is appropriate, making it possible to make any operational changes necessitated in the light of the assessment of current knowledge."
"We would like to see energy and the environment in intelligent coexistence, but we must, at all costs, avoid sacrificing energy on the altar of the environment."
"The consequences of this would be disastrous for the Member States."
"- (FR) Despite its general title, once the gift wrapping has been removed, it readily becomes apparent that the draft resolution proposed by Mr Chichester is intended primarily to promote the nuclear industry on the pretext that it does not produce much CO2, at least as far as the power plants are concerned."
"Indeed, while it remains extremely vague on most environmental matters related to the energy sector, this resolution proposes that, in future, in the countries of the EU, nuclear-based electricity production should at least retain the share which it currently has."
"And this at a time when an increasing number of European countries are deciding to get out of nuclear power."
"However, rather more than electricity production, the reduction of CO2 emissions involves the problem of the organisation of transport - a point of which the resolution makes no mention."
"It is silent, too, on the considerable risks inherent in nuclear-based electricity production and the accumulation, over the very long term, of radioactive waste!"
"We can do nothing other than vote against this draft resolution."
"That concludes the vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"I hope you will bear with me."
"This is not a point of order, but I believe it is an historic announcement."
"As the House is probably aware, there have been recent announcements by David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party and Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein."
"Both have come out with statements which are committed to the peace process and to decommissioning for Northern Ireland."
"I am sure that the President will want to write on behalf of the European Union to congratulate all parties concerned on their actions, their courage and their determination to carry the peace process and decommissioning forward, and I am sure that you will agree that peace in Northern Ireland offers hope to everyone everywhere."
"Mr Cashman, I am grateful for that information."
"I am sure that the Presidency and all of us offer our congratulations."
"I do not know if you knew, but I personally was rapporteur for budgets for the first aid package for the peace programme in Northern Ireland, and in a way, I therefore feel personally involved."
"Judicial cooperation"
"The next item is the debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0060/1999 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, on the proposal for a Council Directive on the service or transfer in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters [COM(99) 219 - C5­0044/1999 - 1999/0102(CNS)];"
"A5-0057/1999 by Mr Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility of joint children [COM(99) 220 - C5­0045/1999 - 1999/0110(CNS)]."
"Mr President, both these reports before us today recognise the increasing mobility of persons and the rise in contractual and commercial transactions across our Union."
"As the internal market develops, our citizens really need a legal framework that guarantees them access to justice wherever they are and whatever their problems."
"I will confine my remarks mainly to the report on the service of documents."
"I concur with Mr Lechner that the rules that formerly governed this are some 25 years old; they are complicated and out of date."
"With the increase in commercial transactions across the internal market, we need new, simple and certain rules."
"When our citizens or our businesses have to resort to the courts, they need to get past that first step, which is the service of documents, possibly in another jurisdiction, before initiating proceedings."
"Here we need a simple procedure."
"As a lawyer in private practice in the UK, I myself, have often wrestled with a pile of books to find the right rules and the right way to go forward for my clients in these circumstances."
"The proposals that we have before us take matters forward but perhaps they do not go far enough."
"My group will re-table certain amendments that were put to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to try to take matters forward even further, to make the systems that we are going to put in place more readily available and open to practitioners."
"We need to take this area of law outside the remit of a few specialists who may be able to charge a lot for it."
"We want to give our citizens across the Union real access to justice so that when they have to resort to the courts they can get things up and running quickly and without difficulties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak about the Gebhardt report on judicial cooperation in family affairs."
"Anyone who comes into contact with judges and registrars in the cross-border areas of our Member States will know that this is a problem that urgently requires solving."
"For a long time, there has been an increasing number - and thankfully one that continues to increase - of marriages and familial relationships between people from different European countries."
"Naturally, this often results in a number of problems."
"There are also more and more people moving or emigrating from one country of the European Union to another in order to live and work there."
"It is indeed the case that the current provisions pertaining to family law and also the international regulations on this subject are simply not adequate to deal with this problem."
"I would therefore like to join Mrs Gebhardt in offering special praise to the Council and Commission for their initiative in taking a decisive step towards solving this problem."
"This is indeed urgently necessary."
"Moreover, in my opinion the shortcomings that the document reveals are positively limited."
"There is a range of lesser aspects that have also been addressed in the committee discussions."
"For example, I still to this day do not fully understand why negative judgements should have been excluded from the scope of this regulation."
"In my opinion, this is particularly problematic, since the fact that negative judgements are not binding in all States may ultimately mean that a State in which a negative judgement is made may not recognise a positive judgement made in another state, with the result that we are once again faced with the disintegration of what constitutes law in the European Union, which, of course, we do not want."
"I would ask that the Council to reconsider this aspect in its further discussions on this subject and that it consider whether this problem cannot indeed be resolved."
"In all other respects, I support the initiative; I think that it is a good one and think that it should be pursued."
"Mr President, this proposal, which we hope will, by means of a Community regulation, resolve the difficulties experienced by our citizens and their families due to failure to recognise judgements on ending the bond of matrimony and parental responsibility, deserves our applause and our sympathy."
"Of course because on this important subject of family law, the very broad area not regulated by the law due to the way judgements cease to be effective across borders has had a legal and moral effect on thousands of our citizens, damaging families' social and psychological stability and particularly affecting the weakest members, that is, women and children."
"We have all at some time been confronted with the tragedies and paradoxes that occur when there is no free movement of judgements, a situation which has resulted in justice being denied to individuals and the obvious absence and omission of obligatory and crucial European instruments, which, in terms of a common area, would eliminate the inconsistencies caused by the legal fragmentation that is the natural consequence of national legal systems."
"This regulation is a sign of the creative development of the Community legal system and represents the introduction of a new series of common rules. Rules which are able to protect European citizens' civil relationships, turning a European area which is fragmented in terms of the protection of rights and the enforcement of obligations into a more organised and structured area in which all citizens will be able to avail themselves, not only of their own national laws, but also now of a common European law which will apply to families in all areas of the Union, unless that area has asked that an exception be made in this matter."
"Mr President, the path that we are taking in the area of judicial and civil cooperation is the right one."
"I therefore urge my friend, Commissioner António Vitorino, to continue along this path."
"There is no formal European citizenship, but there will be when in the most relevant branch of law, civil law, Europe has the legitimacy and the strength to guarantee our citizens' rights and to enforce justice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it feels important to debate this issue with you - an issue which, too, is about the best interests of the child."
"We had the pleasure of discussing this yesterday with you, as well."
"The fact that we have this regulation on the agenda is also a very good way indeed of celebrating children' s rights."
"I know that rapporteur Gebhardt was thinking of just that point when drafting the amendments which I hope the Commission will adopt."
"In these, she pleads that, whatever judgements are made and whatever concrete steps are taken in this area, they should be so expressly with children' s best interests in mind."
"Thank you, Evelyne Gebhardt, for these amendments."
"I also take the view, expressed by all the previous speakers, that this is needed in the mobile Europe of today."
"It is needed in the mobile Europe of today where, despite this mobility, we still experience discrimination."
"For example, articles 16 and 18 are needed so that cases of child abduction do not have to lead to judicial reviews."
"We know of course that child abduction and the prospect of a subsequent judicial review can lead to tremendously heart-rending conflicts."
"I also share the view of Mrs Wallis, a colleague from my group, that we must go further, partly through supporting her amendments but also, I hope, through the Commissioner' s seeing new possibilities in the light of the Tampere Summit as to how we might go further in this area."
"Take, for example, maintenance disputes (an issue I understood not to be covered by this proposal), that is to say the financial aspect of the dissolution of a marriage, together with the issue of parental responsibility."
"These questions are not dealt with here but can in practice also involve problems which are tremendously difficult to solve."
"I also want to ask for colleagues' support when our Group supports Amendment No 3, together with the corresponding amendment from Mr Lehne' s opinion as delivered to the committee responsible. In this way, we shall be able to reform the Nordic Convention in the same area."
"I hope that it will be possible for the Nordic Convention to go further and support the same objectives, but in that case we shall also need the explanations which were to be found in the opinion delivered on this proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Finally, I want to say that the present partnership should aim to create a situation in which we begin to rely more upon each other in Europe."
"Mr President, after hearing the statement given yesterday by Commissioner Vitorino on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, I am happy that we are today discussing concrete issues from which children can really benefit."
"On account of the increased freedom of movement, more and more marriages between people of different nationality are taking place within the European Union."
"When these marriages take place or indeed are dissolved, particular problems frequently arise due to the different laws of the two States."
"The people who suffer the most in these cases are the children, who have to cope with additional problems, as if the other problems were not enough."
"The new proposal by the Council for a regulation on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial cases and parental responsibility proceedings now guarantees uniform marital status for the citizens of Europe."
"Marriage and divorce documents as well as judgements should, as a result, be recognised in all countries of the European Union."
"However, we must ensure that applying these principles does not continue to lead to differences and discriminations, something which unfortunately is currently the case."
"In particular, the welfare of the children from these marriages must be ensured."
"Custody proceedings should be coherent and conclusive, and the result recognised everywhere."
"The basic interests of the children must come before everything else."
"The individual child must have the possibility of being heard before a court and in this way of clarifying that his or her welfare is taken into account. I hope that our colleague Mr Watson' s compromise solution does not create any additional problems, and that we are able to settle this important issue in the best interests of the child."
"Only in this way can we avoid international legal proceedings lasting several years and prevent child abduction, which unfortunately often happens as a result of legal confusion."
"We must tackle the problem of the various conflicts of laws that arise in matrimonial cases."
"Only in this way can we achieve legal security in the international domain for the citizens and children of Europe."
"For this reason, I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Gebhardt on behalf of myself and my group, for her splendid report, and I hope that we can now take a major step forward in the best interests of children."
"The problem we are working on here is, in reality, not only a European problem but also a global, cross-frontier problem."
"Really, we ought to be working for a global convention in this area, but the present proposal takes us some way down the road, for it is undoubtedly very important - as just about every speaker has agreed - that we recognise each other' s decisions on matrimonial issues and on matters concerning custody, especially at a time such as we are experiencing now where the structure of the family is undergoing tremendous change."
"In this connection, I can only express my pleasure at the fact that there are still a number of countries - including EU Member States - which recognise marriages between two people of the same sex and appreciate that such couples may also wish to have children and that this is a wish they can justifiably demand should be fulfilled."
"One can only hope that, in future where these matters are concerned, the motions of the heart will ever more be granted expression - as they have been in issues of divorce - and that the voices of religion and moralism will be hushed."
"My group can therefore back the report."
"As a Dane, I have a special problem, of course, when we talk about making decisions concerning legal questions under pillar 1, but I am certain that it is a problem which can be solved, for this is undoubtedly an area which Denmark also wishes to see put in order."
"Mr President, I hope that what the Danish Member just said will never happen, and that families will retain their traditional structure."
"No, no, I do not think there is anything to laugh about: in my opinion, families must not adopt a structure that is not part of the normal order of society."
"We are talking about an extremely sensitive issue, relationships within families, especially as regards citizens' mobility within the boundaries of the European Union."
"Essentially, what we are dealing with is the protection of minors, which is already very difficult when they live in families that we could define as normal, or rather traditional."
"I think that a particularly sensitive aspect is that of listening to children."
"Many of us, the different Member States of the European Union, have already addressed the issue of using children' s guardians at a time when families are going through a particularly difficult time in their lives, such as when couples separate, with all the repercussions - especially in psychological terms - that affect the children involved."
"In the very short time I am allowed I would like to emphasise just a few points."
"Something that is of particular interest is parental authority, especially in relation to nomadic peoples who are now present in large numbers throughout Europe."
"Very often, as local administrators as well, we are faced with situations which are particularly regrettable and which are not covered by legislation."
"This regulation certainly represents a significant step forwards - and we are grateful to the rapporteur for this - but we need to return to the issue with particular reference to nomadic children, to Roma children, and therefore to everything related to the internal problems of these families, including, precisely, with regard to mobility in Europe."
"Mr President, regarding Mrs Gebhardt' s report, I have no doubts as to the good intentions of our rapporteurs and I share their concern to reinforce the legal security of people involved in matrimonial cases which are as delicate as they are painful for the parties concerned."
"But, since our objective is to contribute to an improvement, I wish to draw your attention to the draft amendment to Recital 10, which I consider problematic."
"Is it proper to entrust the task of defining the notion of parental responsibility to the Court of Justice, whereas the proposal for a Regulation envisaged that reference would be made to the national law of the Member State concerned?"
"Would it be an easy matter for the Court of Justice, to provide a definition of the notion of parental responsibility in isolation without the existence of a common family law for marital cases, which is neither desirable, nor envisaged at the present time?"
"My fear is that with this amendment, the application of this text, whose aim is to strengthen legal security, may create vagueness, which is harmful."
"Furthermore, attributing this new area of competence to the Court of Justice would surely increase the Court' s caseload, which is already excessive."
"The rapporteurs themselves note the very marked differences between Member States as regards private law, thus explaining the serious reservations expressed within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I would suggest that the rapporteurs should be satisfied with resorting to a Community legal instrument without seeking to harmonise the fundamental legal concepts."
"If these amendments were to be adopted, it would be difficult for me to support this proposal."
"Mr President, I would not like to tamper, no pun intended, with the enthusiasm of this House on the subject of the European legal area."
"The solutions which we must arrive at must fulfil a twofold role."
"Firstly, every plaintiff must be able to find a judge for his case, otherwise this would be denial of justice."
"He should be able to find applicable law, and it must be possible to enforce the judgement."
"This is the requirement of legal security."
"Secondly, in the meantime, it is essential to ensure that the diversity of Member State legislation is respected. This is no more than the translation into the legal sphere of respect for cultural or national diversity."
"We must get away from the unification of legislation which is too often pursued here on the pretext of harmonisation."
"The obvious solution is to unify international private law rules exclusively, without unifying the fundamental rules."
"Unification of international private law rules, i.e. regulations on conflicts of jurisdiction and rules on conflicts of laws."
"It must be possible to clearly identify which law the court is going to apply, since a court with local jurisdiction does not necessarily apply its national law and in some circumstances this procedure is a fair one."
"As for the development of enforcement procedures - the enforcement orders or ""exequatur"" for foreign judgements - this is no doubt useful in civil cases, such as divorce or custody cases, just as they are useful in some aspects of mutual assistance in legal matters, but care must be taken not to go too far along this route."
"We must not arrive at a situation where, under the pretext of mutual assistance in legal matters, a wall of silence reigns over Europe in the name of political correctness."
"I shall not mention Switzerland' s degrading handover of an old man, 90 years old, to France, since this is a matter involving a country which is not a member of the European Union, but I shall simply mention the increasingly repressive legislation which mean to dictate political and historical attitudes, a phenomenon I would not like to see spreading from one European state to the next."
"Mr President, without doubt the directive proposed by the European Commission is an important step towards the creation of a single area of freedom, security and justice. It organises judicial cooperation at Community level and introduces uniform rules in international private law, an area in which they were sorely lacking."
"Standard treatment of all European citizens in connection with family disputes and the care and control of children in the event of divorce will spare thousands of families considerable anguish and bureaucratic obstruction, thereby bolstering the sense of security and confidence in the European Union of our citizens."
"The proposed changes, such as giving the child an opportunity to be heard before taking a decision and full compliance with the Hague Convention, seek mainly to safeguard the rights and interests of children."
"I hope that Mrs Gebhardt will use her considerable skills to draft a change which satisfies all sides."
"However, this generally positive assessment of the directive notwithstanding, I believe that numerous matters still remain unresolved, such as full application of the new arrangements to third country nationals resident in the European Union and to persons living together outside close, traditional family arrangements."
"The directive is a good directive; however, it needs to be more daring if it is to pave the way, in the foreseeable future, for a single European family law which takes account of the huge social, economic and cultural changes which are the order of our day."
"The construction of Europe has for too long ignored private law, and the Citizens' Europe, which we represent, must, as we said last night on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the International Convention, henceforth take into consideration the real concerns of families and the welfare of children."
"We all have a recollection of a number of cases, such as the Lancelin-Thiemann case which last year contaminated discussions between Germany and France on the subject of the dramatic situation of the children of this couple."
"The Gebhardt report rightly stresses that the increasing level of free movement within the European Union is causing and will in future cause an increasing number of marriages between nationals of different countries, hence the interest of examining this question."
"Current European law has not managed to draw the conclusions of this development, thus placing couples, and more particularly children, in a very complex position."
"The regulation submitted for our opinion today is therefore particularly welcome in so far as it includes unquestionable advantages in relation to the so-called Brussels II Convention, signed in 1998, but not as yet ratified."
"If it is unanimously adopted in Council, this regulation may come into force very soon and shall be applied immediately and harmoniously throughout the European Union, thus enabling long drawn out wrangling over jurisdiction, which is harmful to everyone, to be prevented."
"I would add that this proposal for a regulation specifically targets legal judgements relating to parental responsibility for joint children, corresponding to the requests made on several occasions by this House."
"But, like other Members, I am concerned by two amendments, Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 5, which is going to attribute a number of responsibilities relating to parental authority to the Court of Justice."
"I am afraid that this is not a matter for its jurisdiction and, moreover, that this may increase the caseload of this Court."
"In my opinion, we should stick to the Commission text."
"If this is the case, I shall support Mrs Gebhardt' s report, which I hope will be widely adopted by Parliament in these terms."
"If there were just one thing to bear in mind, this would be the interest of the children, and I have my doubts as to whether it would be in the interest of the children if Parliament were to adopt these two amendments."
"Children are the ones with a lot to gain from the rapid implementation of regulations acknowledging their simple right not to have to endure the choice of their parents to live in different European countries."
"Of course, major problems will remain, particularly the matter of the disparity of applicable divorce laws and the consequences of this, but this regulation is just an initial step and I congratulate the rapporteur on this initiative."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I would like firstly to express my pleasure that the opinions relating to the proposal for a directive on the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters have been adopted, as well as the proposal for a regulation on the competence, recognition and implementation of judgements on matrimonial matters."
"I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Lechner and Mr Gebhardt for their excellent work as the rapporteurs of these two initiatives."
"These two instruments constitute one of the foundation stones of the Community building that we are constructing, the main aim of which is to give all the Union' s citizens and legal operators easier, more rapid and more efficient access to justice with a safeguard from the rules of legal security."
"As far as the proposal for a regulation is concerned, by reducing the time it takes to transmit judicial and extrajudicial documents from one Member State to another, we are adopting an instrument which will enable the judicial processes to progress in the best conditions of speed and legal security whilst preserving the rights of all parties involved."
"I would particularly like to highlight the importance of adopting the proposal for a regulation which constitutes a cornerstone of the creation at Community level of a European legal area."
"To this effect, the Tampere European Council made the mutual recognition of judgements one of the pivotal points in the development of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Heads of State and Government themselves recognised the fact that priority must be given to family relationships and particularly to resolving issues of divorce and parental responsibility."
"If the movement of people within the European Union is going to be more than an empty phrase, it must be accompanied by the necessary measures in the field of family law."
"This proposal is the first, and only the first of these measures, because it provides standardised rules on the jurisdiction of courts in the Member States in matters of divorce and separation as well as in the matter of processes relating to the enforcement of parental responsibility, and even provides a clear and coherent framework for rapid, practically automatic recognition in every Member State of judgements made in another Member State within the scope of the regulation."
"These are legal instruments that will open the way for the future adoption of other solutions that go further in the direction the Tampere European Council wanted."
"As far as the directive is concerned, the Council can accept practically all of the amendments, except the amendments relating to Nos 3, 5 and 10, which we feel do not fit in with the proposal' s premise."
"If I am not mistaken, Amendment No 3 brings nothing new to the measure in question, in that the Member States which will designate a single authority and then a central authority are precisely the ones whose legislation does not allow for the direct transmission of judgements."
"As for Amendment No 5, we feel that it places an excessive burden on the central authorities in the context of a directive-based system in which these central authorities have only a subsidiary function."
"And finally, concerning Amendment No 10, we feel that it contradicts Article 11(2) of the proposal for a directive."
"As far as the proposal for a regulation is concerned, we can accept most of the proposed amendments, namely Amendments Nos 1 to 8, 13 to 18 and 20."
"We feel that Amendments Nos 9 and 10 can be partially accepted, with a slight alteration which does not change them fundamentally. We have objections to three amendments: Nos 11, 12 and 19."
"Concerning Amendment No 11 - and I hope that a new oral proposal will be made so that I can comment on the new version - where it states that the best interests of the child must be taken into account, we feel that this would clear the way for a judgement to be made - with regard to the costs to be borne by the State due to receive the judgement - which is not appropriate for this kind of instrument."
"We agree, therefore, with the principle of child hearings, but not with a new judgement on this basis."
"We feel Amendment No 12 gives an advantage to the mechanical implementation of a possible, out of date judgement over a more recent one which may have been issued on the same matter."
"Priority must be given to the most recent judgement, because that will be the one that best takes into account the child' s situation at the time the verdict is made."
"And finally, in relation to Amendment No 19, I understand the meaning of the proposal, but I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the rule concerning the translation of decisions does not fall within the scope of a regulation on the competence, recognition and implementation of judgements; the proper place for the rule on translations is the directive on the transmission of documents, the other instrument that we are debating today, which lays down precisely this possibility of translation."
"Finally, Mr President, I am convinced that by adopting these instruments we are giving a great boost to the free movement of persons today."
"And we are providing a balanced boost, because, on the one hand, we are favouring the internal market and economic integration with the directive on judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters, but, on the other hand, we are also attempting to give primacy to people' s rights, to the rights of human beings and to the rights of children, because, in addition to having to suffer the trauma that a divorce always causes, they should not have to suffer the trauma of the bureaucratic nightmare that the recognition of judgements involves."
"And this is at last proof that the Union provides added value for our citizens' actual lives."
"And thus we honour a major principle of the project of European construction, which is designed to think of people, by people and for people."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"Checks on nuclear installations in the CEECs"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the implementation by the Commission of the programme for checking nuclear installations in the Central and Eastern European countries."
"Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement this afternoon on the programme of work being undertaken by the Commission for improving safety in civil nuclear installations in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I ask myself, having listened quite carefully to the Commissioner, whether there is any new information in the statement that he has made."
"He has given us a fair amount of detail and a fair number of promises about what is happening or will happen."
"I note the time-scale of some of his comments that reactors will be shut down early in 2006 and 2008 - I will come to the question of whether a reactor should be shut down or not and how quickly in a moment."
"I must agree with the Commissioner and the Commission position on the primacy of safety issues."
"I think we can all agree that where nuclear power stations and nuclear installations are concerned, it is absolutely essential that safety, safety of operation, safety of construction and design, be given top priority."
"For obvious reasons, public opinion has to be assured that this is the case."
"I also agree that it is essential for countries which are largely dependent upon nuclear power plants for their electricity and energy that closure programmes are phased to allow time to provide replacement capacity."
"In some countries, when reactors have had to be shut down, there has been a loss of electricity which has caused severe hardship."
"You have to weigh up that consideration with the debatable issue about safety."
"We also have to bear in mind that we are still negotiating with countries which are sovereign, independent states and we have to respect their internal procedures."
"We are in a slightly sensitive position in terms of telling them or asking them or assisting them to do things that we want to do, but that they may not be enthusiastic about doing themselves."
"The question is that if a reactor is safe to run until 2006, why is it not safe to run for its full economic life?"
"If it is unsafe it should be closed down immediately."
"That is the conundrum that faces us."
"I feel, with respect to the Commissioner, that you have not quite addressed that conundrum this afternoon."
"Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for the information."
"Allow me to say that, after this, I was placed rather in the same situation as when one reads the news, for example in one' s own country, that a hospital which has just been renovated at a cost of millions is to be closed down."
"You mentioned that EUR 200 million had been invested in the Phare partnership to improve safety."
"I believe that, where this is concerned, we need an honest appraisal to be carried out."
"What have we done previously?"
"What has proved to be unnecessary now in the light of the perhaps rather stricter line Europe has adopted in the membership negotiations?"
"I think we may have behaved a little stupidly here."
"I also think that uncertainty in the matter of what we have had a legal basis for doing has shown that we in the Community could do with rather more in the way of conditions where energy supplies are concerned, something we shall be discussing over the next few days when it comes to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Where the Slovakian nuclear power plant, Bohunice, is concerned, it is obvious that we need more information about what the real situation is there in the matter of safety."
"Unfortunately, we have the type of situation in which none of us knows anything about this; we do not have access to the same information as the Commission."
"Where Ignalina is concerned, I want to say that I do not think that the information we have obtained is really satisfactory in the light of, for example, the so-called WENRA report where it is stated that we do not have any certain knowledge about safety in so-called reactor shutdown systems."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I too would like to wish you a speedy recovery from your cold."
"I would also like to thank you for your earlier comments that nuclear power stations must be treated politically and economically, that we cannot expect them to be taken out of operation overnight and that we need an exit plan and time to implement it."
"I think that Bohunice had sufficient time."
"I must remind you of the Hermes Agreement under which Bohunice was to be removed from the network by the year 2000 at the latest."
"In the light of this, I was extremely surprised by your laudatory acceptance of the new shutdown dates for Bohunice in 2006 and 2008."
"I shall now come to my question, Commissioner."
"A study by the Vienna Institute for Risk Research has been available since the summer."
"Although it has become somewhat dusty sitting in the drawer of the Minister for Consumer Protection, Mrs Prammer, thanks to good cooperation with the environmental non-governmental organisations we became aware of this study and since last Thursday have had the opportunity to examine its contents in detail."
"We need not discuss the safety defects in Bohunice, although perhaps I may raise just three of the most important points: as before, there is no replacement for the missing reinforced concrete and no pressure suppression system or other safety systems; the upgrading is inadequate seismologically; and the reactor pressure container is so brittle that the possibility of bursting cannot be excluded."
"Now for something funny: in 1995 the UJD, the Slovak Nuclear Supervisory Authority, stopped issuing the standard multiannual operating licence and has been issuing provisional one-year extensions in order to compel the operators to carry out the necessary upgrading."
"In vain it would seem!"
"The currently valid safety certificate for Bohunice expires in the year 2000."
"In Austria, we say that from the year 2000, Bohunice will be spotless!"
"This study was submitted to the Slovak government at the beginning of September, but not to you, Commissioner."
"This sort of neglect is not unique to Austrian politics; it also exists within the EU."
"At the same time, however, Mrs Prammer' s office assures me that she did inform you of the unresolved safety issues relating to Bohunice V1."
"So I ask you, Commissioner: were you aware of this study?"
"If you were, the behaviour of the Commission is scandalous!"
"If you were not, I would urge you to reconsider the facts."
"If you still do not have the documents, I have brought them with me from Vienna."
"You yourself have said, if I may quote you, that the final words have not yet been spoken."
"Perhaps the Commission could also exchange words with the Slovak Nuclear Supervisory Authority."
"We demand earlier and binding shutdown dates for Bohunice as well as clear assistance with the exit plan."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the clear way in which you have presented the Commission' s position, although this definitely does not mean that I am in full agreement with it."
"I would like to protest at your assertion that nowhere and at no time is it possible to take nuclear power stations out of operation overnight."
"You know, coming as you do from Germany, that if it is necessary, and I am thinking here of the Greifswald nuclear power station, it can be done overnight, provided, of course, that there is the necessary political will and that the necessary environment is created."
"I am also not deluding myself that in the Central and Eastern European countries, there are some extremely difficult issues which are in part economic and even social."
"However, I also believe that I am forced to protest, and perhaps this has something to do with the undecidedness of energy policy within the European Union, if in the cases in question you ultimately see safety in terms of shutdown, with which I agree, yet when it comes to comparable power stations in the CIS States you want to ensure safety by upgrading and by the European Union promoting safety measures."
"I believe that our objectives within the European Union and in the candidate countries can only be achieved by shutting down power stations."
"Setting another rule outside the Community, as in the cases under consideration here, I consider to be highly problematic and I believe that all in all we would be well advised to make shutting down the rule not just in Eastern Europe but for energy policy within the European Union as a whole and to not endanger the possibilities of this by carrying out further deregulation."
"Mr President, the area of nuclear safety is of fundamental importance in pre-accession strategy."
"One of the conditions placed on Bulgaria for opening accession negotiations is precisely to draw up a reasonable timetable for the closure of unit 1-4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant before the end of 1999."
"This plant is actually obsolete, according to the distinction outlined by the Executive in Agenda 2000, where nuclear plants are divided into three categories: Soviet type or obsolete plants which must be dismantled because they are dangerous, other plants that need to be repaired to allow them to reach safety levels acceptable to the Union, and a tiny number of western type plants which can remain active provided their safety level remains high in the long term."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Humans Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the report on nuclear sector related activities for the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States, unanimously adopted on 27 October last year, I stressed the crucial importance of safety, defining it as a requirement for accession for new Member States of the Union."
"In fact, nuclear safety affects the lives of millions of citizens of the European Union and Eastern European countries."
"Abandoning civil nuclear power is not on the cards, and we need to bear in mind the economic and social implications of the decisions that the Union wants to be adopted in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Nevertheless, whether they border on these countries or not, the Member States are expressing their concern and disagreement with an accession process that does not take nuclear safety into account."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I find that I can sleep well next to a German, French or British nuclear power station."
"As far as is humanly possible, an MCA ought to be excluded during routine operation."
"I cannot sleep so well, if at all, next to the nuclear power stations in the candidate countries."
"May I make a personal confession at this point, as Mr Swoboda did earlier: I am a passionate advocate of the swift expansion of the European Union."
"All the States which have already submitted their applications for accession are a part of Europe."
"They belong to us and we belong to them."
"However, I believe that it not just our right, but also plainly and simply our duty, to point out that nuclear power stations in the applicant countries have very different standards of operation."
"Nowadays, we do not get into a Zeppelin if we want to fly to Brussels or Strasbourg; we are delighted to have ultra-modern planes at our disposal."
"Furthermore, we also need to know exactly how these nuclear power stations stand with regard to computer changeover difficulties for the year 2000."
"Allow me to quote the Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr Wolfgang Schüssel, who said on 9 November: ""if the candidate countries- Slovakia, Lithuania and Bulgaria - want to take up accession negotiations with the EU, then they must submit to the European Council of Helsinki by the middle of December specific closure plans for the three non-convertible nuclear power stations"" ."
"And again on 11 November: ""in the case of nuclear power stations which are already in operation, EU standards must be the guiding rule."""
"I in no way share the opinion of one Austrian socialist minister who considered that there should be no discussions until the nuclear power stations are shut down."
"This is completely the wrong approach and I fully and firmly reject it."
"I am convinced that we will not have difficulties with nuclear power stations in the west in terms of the changeover to the year 2000."
"I do not have the same conviction for nuclear power stations in the east."
"Something could go wrong and we need to offer assistance."
"Chernobyl taught us that the term ""neighbourhood"" simply has to be redefined in the case of nuclear plants."
"At that time we were all next-door neighbours."
"Greater flexibility on the part of the applicant countries should be expected in the name of good neighbourliness."
"I too would like to thank the Commissioner for his words and, as a Christian Democrat, I would like to offer him more than just good advice to take with him and to ask whether he perhaps needs an aspirin C. I should be happy to fetch him one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a truly momentous occasion in Parliament when bitter pills are handed out here and there in order to wish one another well."
"I was very pleased, Commissioner, that you were recovered today and that it would be desirable if the reactors, in particular Yaslovske Bohunice, had been decommissioned earlier."
"I think that the debate which we have been having for some time now could perhaps be moved forward a bit with a few specific questions."
"In your evaluation, Commissioner, what do you think of the fact that relatively large sums of money from EU programmes, e.g. PHARE, have been poured into upgrading in the east and yet there are so few positive results to show for it?"
"What can be done, and this is my particular concern, so that the proposed and now accepted exit dates regarding all types of nuclear power stations, not just Yaslovske Bohunice, can actually be met?"
"What are the Commission' s plans, since we all know that there can be long gaps between an announcement and the actual decommissioning?"
"On another point: I also received the investigation by the Risk Institute of the Academic Senate at the University of Vienna, which puts the issue of Yaslovske Bohunice in a different light again."
"The previous speaker, Madam Echerer, has already pointed out that there is no containment and also, according to the independent assessment of the atomic safety authority in Slovakia, no adequate operational safety of the plant."
"What does the Commission intend to do about this?"
"Is it not also the case, if we once again refer to Yaslovske Bohunice, that it simply isn' t true that the Slovak Republic is so very dependent on these reactors?"
"I would like to quote from a report from a joint working group of the European Union and Slovakia on nuclear energy which states very clearly: ""Even without Bohunice V 1, the country is in a position to cover its average consumption needs with national production throughout the period to 2015."""
"This means that the arguments which are continually produced by Slovakia that decommissioning would endanger independent energy provision are not correct."
"By way of summary, I would like to conclude that I am still convinced that there must be a little bit more, specifically concerning the premature nature of decommissioning and realisability, where the EU will be able to make the necessary financial aid a little easier."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for the very thorough report he has given us of the problems he is encountering in this field which is so essential to the future of Europe."
"Listening to him and to my fellow Members throughout this debate took me back to the recent election campaign and to the answers that we were required to provide at that time to the voters regarding the need to establish and to complete the construction of Europe."
"Clearly this is one of the fields - i.e. the threat constituted by the existence of so many nuclear power plants but also all the armaments accumulated on the territory of the former Soviet Union - where none of the Member States may, individually, claim to intervene on behalf of security of the entire continent."
"Only Europe and - Commissioner, I thank you for having understood this - only a united Europe may go to the assistance not only of the countries which are applying for membership of the European Community, but also all those which have nuclear installations which do not comply with our safety standards, in solving this problem taking their own economic imperatives into account."
"I would therefore thank Commissioner Verheugen for reminding us that it is only if each of the Member States makes a contribution to providing the necessary appropriations that we shall be able to achieve this objective which is common to all of us and which has been mentioned by all of us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, firstly may I thank you for your get-well wishes."
"It is a genuine cold, not a political one."
"I shall gladly take some aspirin C later, hoping that I do not also get stomach ache."
"I feel vindicated by the debate which you have conducted and thank you for the full and unambiguous political support which was evident in your contributions."
"It is very important for the Commission to be able to point out in its discussions that the European Parliament sets the most stringent high standards in the issue of nuclear safety."
"This is an important factor for the States with which we are dealing because they are well aware that at the end of the accession negotiations the European Parliament must give its consent, that nothing, therefore, is possible without the European Parliament and that the wishes of the European Parliament in this matter are consequently of prime importance."
"I would like to make clear that we are focusing on reactors which, according to the G7 opinion dating, I think, from 1992 cannot be upgraded, not because of their safety defects in operation but because of their design."
"We are therefore talking about reactors which are constructionally unsafe and whose constructions cannot be upgraded, at least not at justifiable costs."
"In all these cases there is only one reasonable solution to the problem, namely shutdown, and, without any doubt, shutdown as quickly as possible."
"Anyone who sees these reactors as a safety risk, as we do, must be concerned to see them shut down sooner rather than later."
"The difficulty is simply that the negotiations on the acquis communautaire, i.e. the accession negotiations, give us only a political means of exerting pressure and nothing more."
"As I have already said, the European Union has only extremely limited competence in this area."
"We are therefore exerting political pressure in this matter, which means that the result will be a political solution. This political solution must not just take into consideration our own wishes."
"I am well aware that this subject is extremely volatile in some Member States and, as the debate also has shown, particularly at this time in Austria. In reaching this solution, we must, of course, realise that this subject has to a certain extent acquired an almost theological importance in the candidate countries."
"In Bulgaria, for example, I can tell you that the issue of the closure of Kosloduj has been the number one topic for some months, the topic which sparks all domestic political antagonisms."
"I must say that the steps which the Bulgarian Government has so far taken, given the balance of power in the country and the fact that the willingness to shut down Kosloduj will be used against the government in the forthcoming elections, as will also happen in Slovakia and Lithuania, must be seen in this light as brave decisions."
"We will not fail to find a compromise, that is to fix a date which we can still accept at worst."
"In each instance this date must be clearly independent of the projected time which each reactor has to run."
"This is what we did with regard to Ignalina and Bohunice."
"I would like to mention something else concerning Bohunice because for some time now there have been attempts to draw me into the Austrian dispute."
"These will not prove successful, however, because I fully agree with the Austrian position that we should try to achieve something even better."
"Wolfgang Schüssel and I both said this clearly in the Council yesterday."
"The Austrian Foreign Minister raised this issue yesterday in the Council and I said that I supported it and, indeed, all the efforts being made to use the, in my opinion, considerable scope which exists;"
"I firmly support this. The problem is simply that when I entered office, as you know, I found a completed agreement with Slovakia; completed and sealed."
"It was published only days after I entered office."
"However, I severely criticised what the Commission had negotiated with Slovakia."
"There was no alternative but to react in the way that I did."
"However, from the outset, including here in Parliament, I have said on many occasions that in the case of Bohunice I believe that further discussion would be appropriate and that the Slovak position gives reason to believe that more can be achieved."
"Some colleagues have voiced the question of whether it is really wise to invest in the safety of nuclear power stations which are to be shut down."
"This is actually an incredibly difficult question and, as I see it, pretty much a question of conscience."
"In recent years the Commission has also spent money on ensuring the operational safety of the nuclear power stations under consideration until such time as they are shut down, basically concentrating measures on the improvement of the safety culture in these countries, the creation of independent supervisory authorities and the training of the personnel who carry out this supervisory work."
"We have not financed investments which would extend the life of these nuclear power stations."
"That does not come into it."
"Unfortunately, however, we must also distinguish between the Soviet-design nuclear power stations in the candidate countries which I have been talking about and the Soviet-design nuclear power stations outside the candidate countries."
"Here we have a different lever."
"In the first instance, the lever is politically very strong because these States wish to enter the EU and we can say plainly and simply that a precondition is that this issue be resolved in a way which is acceptable to us."
"In the case of Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Ukraine or other States, we obviously do not have the same means of exerting pressure."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that the European Union must also be involved in raising the safety standard in these States."
"It really is a dreadful dilemma."
"We know that a nuclear power station must be shut down and yet we have a political situation in which this cannot be achieved."
"We are faced with the question of whether to do something to at least ensure safe operation and perhaps gradually improve it, knowing full well that this might lead to the nuclear power station which you want to shut down remaining in operation longer than would otherwise be the case."
"I have to say that these are questions which do not let you sleep peacefully."
"The speaker who said that was completely right."
"However, where nuclear safety is concerned we must, I believe, leave no measure untried which might lead to further increasing the level of safety which we already have."
"I see no alternative other than, where we are dealing with power stations which we want to shut down but which, for the political reasons mentioned, we ourselves are unable to shut down, doing something to at least remedy the most serious safety defects, however difficult and complicated that might be."
"This is my answer to the very basic question which was asked."
"We will certainly be returning to this subject on frequent occasions."
"I sincerely hope, and I say this with good cause, that on the next occasion that this matter is discussed I will be able to report on a situation which is considerably better than it is today."
"President, I would just like to say to the Commissioner, if I may, that I liked his summing up much more than his statement at the beginning."
"I congratulate him on it, particularly in the circumstances of his health, and I say well done, and come back and say more to us in that fashion Commissioner."
"(The sitting was suspended at 4.49 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.)"
"Ban on British beef - Production and sale of tobacco"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the decisions taken at today' s meeting of the Commission."
"The Commission took a decision today on my initiative to initiate formal legal proceedings against France for not lifting the embargo on British beef."
"This decision is without prejudice to the negotiations which are continuing on an amicable settlement to the current dispute."
"Let me be very clear."
"We are very close to a solution, and I remain convinced that an amicable solution is in the best interests of all parties, the UK, France and the Community."
"Negotiations and contacts are continuing over the few outstanding issues which continue to block an agreement."
"I am hopeful that with a little goodwill on all sides the ban can be lifted in the very near future."
"I am aware that there are critics, including in this House, of the discussions that have taken place in this case."
"However these discussions are the best means to reach an early solution."
"In the absence of formal procedures to lift the ban within the EU, the situation is even more difficult."
"The British efforts to lift the ban in third countries, including the US, and in its Commonwealth partners, bear this out."
"Nonetheless it is necessary for the Commission to formally signal that France has not fulfilled its obligations to lift the ban."
"I am asking France therefore to submit its position in reply within two weeks."
"I have also informed the Commission of the situation concerning Germany, the only other Member State which continues to impose a ban on the import of UK beef."
"In this instance, however, the German authorities have not declared that they will not lift the ban."
"Instead their position is that a number of constitutional steps have to be cleared, in particular the approval of the Bundesrat."
"In Germany' s case also, however, there is now a need for positive action to lift the ban."
"I will be reviewing the situation in the next few days with my services in this respect: in particular Germany will be asked for an indication of its timetable for lifting the ban."
"I will be insisting on equivalent treatment for both countries, and a communication will be sent to Germany in this regard requesting its proposals on a timetable for lifting the ban."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I welcome the fact that recognition will be given to Community law."
"Legal awareness of Community law must be increased in the Member States."
"However, I would like to ask you whether we are looking at a long time period if you initiate treaty infringement proceedings."
"In the meantime, will the Commission ensure in negotiations and in any compromise decisions that what you announced during the hearings at your installation, by which I mean testing, will be applied and that beef labelling, which will become obligatory on 1 January 2000 unless other regulations are passed, will take effect in connection with the lifting of the import ban and its enforcement in the States which have adopted import bans?"
"This is the first step under the old Article169 procedure which is now under Article 226."
"Provision is made in that Article for sending a letter of this type prior to the actual institution of the proceedings."
"But it is part of the infringement proceedings and is regarded as the first step."
"It sets out in chronological form the present position, how we have reached this stage; it then sets out the legal position and then requests France to respond and set out whatever arguments it wishes to advance in its reply."
"All this is to be done within a period of two weeks."
"Within the discussions over the last few weeks, a number of issues were discussed, as you are probably aware, and one of the issues that was identified was the question of tests, as you rightly identify in your question."
"You draw attention to the fact that during my hearings on 3 September before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I mentioned that it was my intention to establish diagnostic testing for BSE on an EU-wide basis."
"That is still my intention."
"That fact was also drawn to the attention of the parties who were involved in these discussions over the last couple of weeks."
"As I mentioned on that occasion, one of the purposes of establishing such a testing system is to ensure that there is an equal testing system throughout the European Union so as to identify the levels of infectivity throughout the EU, and in particular to identify what further measures may be necessary."
"The removal of SRMs would be one particular issue I have in mind in relation to that."
"On the question of identification and labelling, one of the important issues that we discussed over the last few weeks was the requirement contained in the legislation for traceability."
"That is an important issue."
"It was discussed in Florence."
"It also forms part of the DBES and is in the forefront of our minds in relation to this and has been incorporated into our discussions."
"This is a very sad day for Parliament and for the rule of law."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner can explain why he has not acted more firmly and insisted earlier that a unanimous scientific opinion is not negotiable."
"This Parliament deals with laws; the people who elected us - certainly in the United Kingdom - are waiting to see the law enforced and have been waiting since October."
"This is a very bad precedent for the European Commissioner, given that he is about to write a White Paper on a food safety agency."
"Are all unanimous scientific committee opinions delivered to him in future to be negotiable?"
"We hope not."
"Secondly, where exactly is France raising problems and can the Commissioner confirm that any problems raised by France must result only in clarification to the French and not in any changes to the British date-based export scheme?"
"As I have said on a number of occasions, including in the committee that Mrs Jackson chairs, the DBES scheme is not a negotiable issue."
"It has not been a negotiable issue nor has it in any way been undermined in the discussions that we have had over the last few weeks."
"I believe that this is a good day for the rule of law, I believe that it is a good day for the Commission and I would suggest that it is also a good day for all the institutions of the European Union including Parliament."
"A decision was taken in the Commission today to initiate infringement proceedings rather than not to initiate legal proceedings."
"In those circumstances, I find it difficult to understand how this could be described as a sad day for Parliament or a sad day for the rule of law."
"These proceedings, as I say, have been decided upon today and they will be initiated unless the discussions that have been taking place produce results within the next few days."
"We came close to resolving these issues over the last few days - I had expected them to be resolved if not yesterday, then certainly this morning."
"I was disappointed in that, but I believe that we may yet finally resolve this issue over the next couple of days."
"I would also like to remind Members of the House that, as I have said on a number of occasions, problems of this nature are much better resolved in an amicable way."
"The resort to litigation is necessary in circumstances where the parties to a dispute or a difficulty cannot reach agreement."
"In the case of this dispute, it seems to me that if these two Member States can resolve this difficulty through discussion, in association with the Commission, that would be by far the best way forward."
"It would also achieve a much faster result."
"I would imagine that the people that Mrs Jackson represents in the UK would like to see this matter resolved quickly, rather than in two years time, by a verdict from the Court."
"That is why I have pursued this particular line and will continue to do so despite the decision today to initiate infringement proceedings."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I share your belief that this is a problem which must be handled extremely carefully."
"You rightly stated that we must take scientific opinions seriously and I assume that British farmers wish to sell safe beef as soon as possible and not wait two years until they can do so."
"For this reason, no one in this House, nor indeed anyone at all, can really want to see treaty infringement proceedings which will take two to three years and create nothing but uncertainty in the European Union during this time."
"Mr Byrne, can you tell me how you will be able to ensure that objections at a scientific level are investigated in the shortest possible time so that Member States are not able to repeatedly raise objections and to apply laws without needing to prove their case?"
"Can you also tell me that you will make clear to Germany that you are expecting constitutional barriers, such as a resolution of the Bundesrat at the earliest possible opportunity?"
"Mr Byrne, finally I would like to ask one more question which I have already asked in Brussels."
"Would you please be a little clearer about the issue of testing?"
"When will you present the House with a proposal to prescribe BSE testing as compulsory in the European Union?"
", Commission."
"In relation to scientific information and its evaluation and so on, this is an issue I have been considering, not only because of the events of the last few weeks when the food safety agency of the Member State in question took a different view from the Scientific Steering Committee."
"That obviously was an issue of some considerable concern to me."
"But also because the Commission and myself, and my service in particular, have been looking at the establishment of an appropriate structure for a food safety authority."
"One of the issues that will be of paramount importance in considering such a structure will be its jurisdiction and how, in particular, it will relate to any food safety agencies established at Member State level."
"Quite clearly, a controversy between these two agencies such as we have had over the last few weeks cannot be tolerated if we hope to have a unified harmonised market."
"Confidence in such a food safety authority at Commission level will have to be such that Member States and the authorities and scientists in Member States, have full input into such an agency but also have confidence in it so that its opinions are fully and readily accepted."
"In relation to the situation in Germany that you asked me about, as I said earlier, my discussions with the minister responsible in Germany lead me to the conclusion that the German Federal Government wishes to move towards lifting the ban and that the discussions arising out of the dispute involving France will ease any lingering concerns that may exist in Germany."
"I have been in constant communication with the authorities in Germany - they have had an input into the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of weeks at observer status level, and I am confident that they understand what has been discussed over the last couple of weeks."
"Therefore, I have every hope that the Federal Government of Germany will take the appropriate steps now to lift the ban."
"In relation to the last part of your question, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, dealing with tests, it is my intention to have something in place in relation to this by the end of the year."
"Commissioner, I am grateful for your assurance that this is the first step of the procedure for infringement proceedings."
"I have had here today beef farmers from my constituency."
"Those farmers have had to wait more than 14 weeks since 1 August and still their beef is not back on the market in France."
"They have now been told that they have to wait a further 14 days until we get the French position."
"May I put it to you straight."
"Do you not already know what the French position is?"
"Has the time not come for the Commission to throw the book at the delinquent Member State?"
"Does not anything else make the Commission look limp and lily-livered and undermine public confidence in the European Union?"
"Will you make it clear please at your press conference that the full force of the law will be used against the delinquent Member State unless this ban is lifted."
"I find it difficult to make it any clearer than I have already made it."
"We have commenced proceedings, we have taken the decision to take the first step in initiating proceedings."
"I do not know which book you think I should throw but it seems to me that the initiating of proceedings is the only step open to me to achieve compliance with Community law apart from negotiations."
"I have been doing that for the last six weeks with considerable success and I expect to continue to negotiate in tandem with the institutional proceedings over the next few days."
"My belief is, as I have said to Parliament on the last occasion I was here, that cool heads and firm determination are much better than adopting another approach."
"This is the approach that I commend, it is the approach I have embarked upon, it is the approach I believe is going to achieve results and it is the approach I intend to continue with."
"Commissioner, obviously, I am still French and I am still in favour of the precautionary principle."
"I have already had the opportunity to ask you a number of questions, which have still not been answered, particularly regarding the varying assessments offered by scientists."
"Consequently, today, as a Member of the European Parliament, I find it hard to see the difference between your experts and the French experts."
"Professor Dormont' s work on prions has, I believe, met with international recognition."
"He is not a person who is working on behalf of a specific lobby or in opposition to a specific lobby."
"He is simply doing what the consumers, the voters and people of France asked him to, i.e. applying the precautionary principle for the sake of food safety."
"He is only doing his job."
"The French Government which set up this food agency is doing nothing more than acting on the requests of the citizens of France."
"We have not, then, had any response regarding the varying assessments of the scientists, and I would like to hear your answer to this."
"I would like to draw attention again to the fact that we had a unanimous opinion from the Scientific Steering Committee set up at European Union level some weeks ago."
"That committee is made up of 16 experts drawn from most of the Member States and is chaired by a fellow countryman of yours."
"The opinion that it expressed was unanimous and reinforced two earlier opinions this same committee had reached. So I am confident that the opinion expressed by them is a good opinion."
"I am also confident that the agreement which is now close to being reached between all the parties will also be acceptable to the French agency."
"In the event that we achieve that, which I earnestly hope we will, it may very well be the end of the difficulty that we have been faced with for the last six weeks."
"I am very interested in the statement the Commissioner made."
"He is quite right to point out that we want to avoid legal proceedings or court proceedings if possible."
"But if he is correct in saying that the two parties are only two days away from a possible agreement, it is absolutely inexplicable that he should be giving one of the parties two weeks in order to resolve this matter."
"We were told several weeks ago that today was the deadline - and yes, the Commission has initiated proceedings."
"But for heaven' s sake Commissioner, by indicating today and presumably also at your press conference, that there is another two weeks, you will make everyone read that as meaning that you have simply extended the deadline."
"How on earth do you justify the fact that in instigating proceedings today you are also effectively sending a signal to the French that they still have another two weeks to take a decision on this matter?"
"You have to understand the actual provisions of Article 226."
"It provides specifically for the sending of a letter of this type and it also specifically calls for a response within a period of two months."
"I felt that a period of two months was too long;"
"I felt that a period of one month was too long;"
"I felt that a period of two weeks was appropriate."
"In those circumstances, that is the period of time that I have included in the letter which is the first step in the initiation of proceedings."
"I should say that this does not mean giving anybody a further two weeks."
"The decision today has been to initiate proceedings."
"That was a decision I said that I would put before the Commission some weeks ago."
"That is what I have done."
"It is the first step."
"It sets out the chronology of the events and the legal position and requests the Member State in question to respond within a period of two weeks."
"No further time has been given."
"This provision is contained in the Treaty of Rome as amended and is something which I cannot change now - other than to shorten the period, which I have done."
"However, I should say that the fact that the letter stipulates a period of two weeks within which to reply does not preclude further discussions taking place and an agreement being reached within the next couple of days, if that proves possible."
"It does not in any way undermine that process because we are, as it were, moving on two separate tracks."
"So I have to assure you that the inclusion of fourteen days in the letter does not, in my mind, suggest an intention to stave off negotiations or further discussions for a period of two weeks."
"Those discussions continue in the hope that we can achieve a result."
"I congratulate Mr Byrne on his position."
"He may well remember that I asked him last week in Brussels to say whether he would instigate proceedings today and obviously he has done so and I am delighted at that."
"But he must understand the feelings of this House."
"Today, we have half the Conservative delegation in this Chamber to hear his responses - and I have to say very few of my Socialist colleagues from the UK party."
"As of today, there are eighty-six infringement proceedings against France, so this is not something new to France."
"One of those infringement proceedings concerns bovine products - could the Commissioner actually answer the question as to what that case involves."
"Secondly, has the UK Government applied for compensation, because it should be doing so on behalf of the British farmers who have lost out?"
"The procedure whereby anybody can apply for compensation arising out of infringement of European law comes under a different article."
"The competence of an individual or State to bring those proceedings is not really a matter for the Commission."
"So I would not necessarily be aware of any such proceedings."
"But so far as I am aware, no such proceedings have been instituted."
"But I may very well be wrong about that."
"According to my calculation, unless there are new members of the Conservative Party, the proportion of Members from our side and their side are almost the same."
"Mr President, I consider that this is a black day for consumer protection!"
"Mr Byrne, you promised when you entered office that you stood for preventive consumer protection and for transparency."
"I would like to ask you, as my colleague has already asked, how you tie that in with the precautionary principle and credibility."
"In the hormone dispute we are taking the side of the precautionary principle, but not here."
"This seems to be a form of force-feeding if consumers do not have the option to be informed."
"How can you promise transparency for the consumer and also postpone the date for labelling?"
"How do consumers have the right to freely decide for or against this meat?"
"What do you think about Article 36 being violated?"
"Article 36 gives Member States the option, when there are health risks, to impose an embargo."
"Where is there more doubt than here?"
"We know little about the incubation time."
"You know that the advisers have expressed grave doubts, including doubts over the problem of transferability."
"So that is my question."
"I believe that that you are undermining Article 36 and that you are trampling underfoot the precautionary principle and transparency for consumers by taking this decision prematurely instead of actually ensuring that foodstuffs are exactly what they should be, suitable to eat and free from health risks!"
"I have said since the time that I took up this position that it was my intention to make decisions on a science basis, examining the best scientific evidence available to me and making my decision on that basis."
"I have available to me a unanimous opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee."
"It is a further opinion expressed by that committee, following an earlier one."
"I make the decision on the basis of that."
"In my view it is a fully transparent process."
"The decision is based, as I say, on the opinion of the SSC."
"I cannot see that there is any lack of transparency in relation to that."
"You raised the question of the precautionary principle."
"The application of the precautionary principle is sometimes not fully understood."
"It only applies in circumstances where either there is no scientific evidence or the scientific evidence that is available is so uncertain so as to be unreliable, and in circumstances where the damage that can be caused is of an irretrievable nature and the remedy that is proposed is proportionate, cost-effective and time-limited."
"To compare the situation of BSE and hormones seems to me to be inappropriate."
"The precautionary principle is not being applied in relation to hormones."
"The decision in relation to hormones in beef and its importation is based on scientific evidence - that was supplied to the Commission before I came into office by the appropriate scientific committee - to the effect that one of the hormones in particular - 17 beta-estradiol - is a complete carcinogen."
"Given that evidence, it seems to me to be appropriate to impose the ban."
"It also seems to me to be inappropriate to lift the ban with that opinion in place."
"In relation to the BSE issue, once again it seems to me that the application of the precautionary principle is inappropriate because we have a firm opinion from the Scientific Steering Committee."
"Its members are drawn from most Member States of the European Union, scientists at the very pinnacle of their careers and abilities who advise on this issue."
"Therefore, I follow their advice."
"Since there is scientific advice on the issue the application of the precautionary principle is not appropriate."
"In relation to the labelling issue, the whole question is currently being examined and is before Parliament."
"It will be open to Parliament to amend the legal principles if it so wishes."
"You raised the question of Article 36."
"In my opinion Article 36 would be an inappropriate defence and would not provide a defence in the circumstances of this particular case."
"It does not provide, as I understand it, for a situation where there is a harmonised market as there is in this instance."
"In relation to transmission, there is no evidence of any other form of transmission of BSE other than the two that have been identified, which are feed and maternal transmission."
"Until such evidence is available it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that these are the only two methods of transmission."
"Commissioner, there are at least 47 very important countries, such as the United States and many countries of the Commonwealth, which are maintaining the embargo on British meat."
"The question I would like to put, following the decision you made today, is this: will you get to the very bottom of this?"
"And will you ask, for example, the World Trade Organisation to state that it is against this embargo?"
"I think that this is a very important question."
"Secondly, yesterday, the President of the Court of Auditors presented his annual report to us in which he points out serious deficiencies in the keeping of the registers of bovine cattle in Great Britain."
"Did you take this into account today when you made your decision?"
"Yes, it is, of course correct to say that there are a number of other countries that have maintained an embargo on the importation of UK beef."
"I have to say that since taking up this job eight weeks ago I have concentrated on the European Union."
"In relation to deficiencies in stock and so on, my understanding of the operation of the DBES scheme is that it protect public health and ensures food safety in relation to the exportation of UK beef."
"I would also draw your attention to the statement contained in the communiqué from the Scientific Steering Committee that beef exported under the DBES scheme is as safe as any other beef in the European Union."
"The point of order is as follows: this is such an important issue which affects British farmers across the UK that we should surely have more time to question the Commissioner."
"This is the first time that he has been able to come and tell us definitely that legal action is going to be taken, and we have a lot of questions."
"Can I request that we have some other time to ask the Commissioner questions?"
"Mrs Lynne, we will see what we can do about that proposal."
"I noticed just now that a Member of the Parliament was seeking to intervene rather more directly than I thought was appropriate."
"I believe that she sought the floor and, like many Members, did not have a chance to put a question to the Commission."
"I therefore share the view of Mrs Lynne that this Question Time has not been long enough given the importance of the subject."
"Nevertheless, can I ask you to confirm that it is quite inappropriate for Members of this House - Liberals or otherwise - to seek to persuade you to hear them."
"I think the staff ought to make sure that this is prevented in the future."
"Thank you very much, Mr McMillan-Scott."
"I hope that colleagues realise that there are still more than 20 people who would wish to ask questions on this issue."
"I try to draw a balance between political groups and between nationalities to make sure that there is fair-play right the way round the Chamber."
"I think the Commissioner has done very well in answering the questions this afternoon."
"I give the floor to the Commissioner for a statement on tobacco."
"- Today the Commission also adopted a proposal for a very important directive on tobacco."
"It is the end of a long consultation process involving the Council and Parliament."
"Essentially it provides for the following: a lowering of current tar content in cigarettes; the introduction for the first time of a limit on nicotine content in cigarettes; the introduction of limits on carbon monoxide; improved and bigger labels on cigarette packs on the dangers of smoking and on the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes; controls on the misleading use of descriptions such as 'mild' and 'low tar' etc.; and new safeguards on additives to tobacco."
"The case for such a directive is clear."
"The Community has very important public health obligations, especially since the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"These include the obligation to ensure a high level of health protection in all Community policies and activities."
"Smoking kills half a million citizens in the European Union each year and is the single, biggest, preventable cause of death."
"We must therefore be seen to take strong measures to tackle the problem."
"The directive, when adopted, will provide European smokers with the highest level of protection in the developed world."
"They will be better informed of what is in their cigarettes and of the dangers of smoking."
"They will also be afforded protection by the measures to limit tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels."
"However, the directive is also proportionate."
"We have been careful not to stigmatise smokers."
"We need to avoid being over-prescriptive and interfering in citizens' day-to-day lives."
"The aim instead is to put in place a framework, where there is full information on tobacco and its dangers."
"This will complement the Community ban on tobacco advertising which will combat industry-led efforts to attract new smokers, especially young people."
"The combination of these measures should ensure that smoking will be a much less contentious issue in the future."
"I am hopeful that Parliament will support the Commission' s proposal under the codecision procedure in the forthcoming negotiations."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0033/1999). We will examine the questions addressed to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Question No 42 by (H-0634/99):"
"Subject: Helms­Burton Act Is the Commission aware of the comments made by the US Secretary of State, Mrs Albright, ruling out any possibility that the US Congress might amend Title IV of the Helms-Burton Act, thereby failing to comply with one of the core aspects of the agreement between the European Commission and the Clinton administration, part of the new arrangements provided for by the Transatlantic Summit between the US and the European Union in May 1998?"
"Is it aware of moves by the US State Department to open an investigation or to seek information or recommendations with a view to reaching agreements involving the Sol-Meliá Group prior to applying the Act to the said group and other European undertakings, including Club Med and LTU, thus blatantly violating the agreements reached between the European Commission and the Clinton administration within the Transatlantic Summit framework granting European undertakings exemption from the scope of the Helms-Burton Act?"
"What measures does it intend to take to ensure that this Act is not applied to European undertakings?"
"Does it intend to stand by the undertaking given by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan to Parliament=s Foreign Affairs Committee, whereby, in the event of a failure to honour the terms of the agreement in full, the European Union would once again ask the World Trade Organisation authorities to convene a panel?"
"The Commission recalls that the decisions and statements made at the European Union-US Summit of 18 May 1998 regarding the Helms-Burton and Iran-Libya sanctions acts, were intended to pave the way for a definitive solution to this major bilateral disagreement."
"The Commission remains very concerned that no tangible progress has so far been made on the US side on their commitment to seek Congressional amendment to Title 4 of Helms-Burton, not least since the US Administration has regularly recalled that the President is obliged in the absence of such an amendment to enforce Title 4."
"The Commission has for its part always made it clear that if action is taken against EU companies or individuals under the Helms-Burton Act it would request a new WTO panel against the US in respect of this act."
"The Commission had urged the US Administration to accelerate the implementation of the May 1998 Summit deal."
"The Commission is aware of the inquiries by the US State Department into the activities of certain of the companies mentioned by the honourable Member and is following the situation very closely."
"The Commission will continue to keep the European Parliament informed of any new developments regarding the implementation of the 18 May 1998 understandings."
"Let me just add this: I raised these issues at a meeting with Secretary of State Albright last week."
"I also went to see Senator Helms on the same visit to Washington."
"I stressed two points: first our commitment to opposing extra-territorial legislation, second our commitment to protecting property rights and the law of contract."
"I pointed out that if a waiver enabled us to trigger the May 1998 undertakings, that would ensure a comprehensive attack on the expropriation of property, not just in Cuba, where the May 1998 understanding was strongly attacked."
"I hope that the senator in particular and his colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives will reflect very carefully on what I said."
"Many thanks to the Commissioner for his reply."
"I would like to say to you, Commissioner, that the fact that the Commission tells us that it is still worried about this situation is frankly not enough."
"It also seems to me to be insufficient that the Commission, in its contacts with Mrs Albright, should say that she has to comply with the commitments which were agreed within the framework of the Transatlantic Summit."
"This is clearly not enough."
"I do not know if you believe that, after twenty months of non-compliance, the Clinton administration will persuade Congress to ratify and amend Title 4 of the law."
"Therefore the question - and I understand and am grateful for your good will, Commissioner - is as follows: is the Commission prepared, in view of the harassment and pressures which European companies are suffering, to do more than express its consternation and concern, and to take some type of measure - and your predecessor, Mr Brittan, committed himself to this before this Parliament: I am well aware of this because I asked the question at the time - in the event that this non-compliance should continue to be absolutely evident and blatant?"
"In a pre-election year, the Senate of the United States is not going to amend the law: is the Commission really prepared to denounce this non-compliance to the authorities of the World Trade Organisation?"
"I do have an answer, which is that if possible it is still in everybody' s interest to have an agreement to allow the undertakings entered into in 1998 to operate."
"It is in everybody' s interest to see a waiver to Title 4, it is in everybody' s interest including potential investors not to have a trade dispute that not just discourages investment but poisons our overall relations."
"So far we have not been obliged to have recourse to a blocking statute, we have not had to go to the WTO panel, though it is perfectly clear that in certain circumstances we would have no other choice."
"I happen to think that at the moment it makes a lot more sense for me to try to persuade American senators, for me to try to persuade the American Administration to behave sensibly, than to throw up my hands and say we are going to go to the WTO."
"If the honourable Member has a better suggestion than going and trying to persuade Senator Helms - which I am not sure has been done recently - I would be delighted to hear in all humility what it is."
"I think for the time being it is more sensible for us, provided there is no action which triggers a recourse to the WTO, to try to persuade the US Administration and the US Senate."
"Mr President, it is a fact that this disgraceful law, known as the Helms-Burton Act, has had catastrophic consequences both for socialist Cuba and its people, and for humanity as a whole."
"Not only does it seek to subjugate a proud race which insists on its right to self-determination; it also signals the wish on the part of the American imperialists, manifested on numerous occasions, to impose their will and their laws on the international economy, on international trade and on international business."
"This is why the Helms-Burton Act has met and continues to meet with general disapproval and demands for its immediate repeal, and rightly so."
"What worries me is that the request for European undertakings to be exempted from the scope of this criminal legislation, however beneficial this may in fact be to European undertakings, fails to solve the problem."
"In essence, it is tantamount to acknowledgement of the Act, thereby detracting from the very pressure which we are exerting for its repeal."
"Do you not think, Commissioner, that the European Union should exert all its influence, using every means imaginable, to bring about the immediate repeal of this unacceptable Act, rather than confining itself to statements."
"I want to assure the honourable Member straight away that the undertakings given in May 1998 did not in any way mean that we accepted the legitimacy of Helms-Burton legislation."
"Our views on extraterritoriality are perfectly clear."
"We have made them clear again and again."
"We have also made clear - and you do not have to be a dyed-in-the-wool imperialist to take this view - that we are against expropriation of property."
"I imagine the honourable Member is against the expropriation of property as well."
"Sanctity of property rights has a great deal to do with the stability of plural societies."
"If, at the end of the day we can have a waiver of Title 4 under Helms-Burton and the triggering of the undertakings we gave in good conscience in May 1998 then that will be in everybody' s interests, it will prevent any trade dispute with the United States and it will give, I hope, investors around the world - not just in Cuba - greater certainty about what they are putting their money into."
"Exceptionally, I am going to accept a procedural motion by Mr Salafranca."
"I fear that this may be a piece of parliamentary manoeuvring, but we are going to run that risk."
"No, Mr President."
"The Commissioner asked me, in relation to the question which I asked him at the time, if there was any other option rather than convincing Senator Helms."
"I would like to tell the Commissioner that here there have been agreements which have clearly established two obligations on the part of both sides: the United States committed themselves to amending Title 4 of the law and not to apply the law to European undertakings."
"They have not amended Title 4 and - as you recognised in your reply, Commissioner - pressures are being applied on European companies."
"Therefore, I believe that the only language that means anything is hard facts."
"And the United States negotiated on the basis of the complaint which was presented to the GATT authorities."
"Therefore Commissioner, I would ask you to expand somewhat, on behalf of the Commission, with regard to your concerns."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for your benevolence."
"Yes, I have been benevolent and I do not want to set a precedent because second questions are not allowed."
"Mr President, as the Commissioner raised the point as to whether I too am against the expropriation of property, I should like to tell him that, when it comes to colonial property, I am in favour of the expropriation of property."
"The American installations in Cuba were colonial property and they were right to expropriate them."
"I would ask Members not to use this Question Time to establish a political, and sometimes ideological, dialogue with the Commissioners."
"This is not the time."
"Anyway, the Commissioner may reply to these atypical questions or interesting interventions, but it must be outside the Rules of Procedure, at your convenience."
"- I would certainly enjoy a polemical exchange with the honourable Member on some other occasion and to share with him, as a former colonial oppressor myself, our respective views of the imperial legacy, but perhaps I can respond to the honourable Member once again."
"It is absolutely clear that if, as we would like and as we have sought, Article 4 waiver is given, then we trigger the agreement of May 1998."
"If we do not get that waiver then the agreement does not come into operation."
"It still makes sense - and there has not been any of the behaviour yet which has required us to put in place a blocking statute or go to the WTO - if it is still possible for us to reach an agreement it would be in everybody' s best interest."
"If it is not possible to reach an agreement, then it is perfectly clear that we will have to go to the WTO panel."
"But for the time being I would still hope that we manage to reach an agreement."
"Question No 43 by (H-0650/99):"
"Subject: East Timor At its sitting of 5 October 1999 the European Parliament was informed by Commissioner Patten that the Commission attaches very high priority to the humanitarian aid and reconstruction support plan for East Timor."
"On the same occasion, Mr Patten spoke on the EU=s support for the actions of UNAMET and on the plans for sending a new evaluation mission to East Timor."
"Is the Commission in possession of fresh data relating to East Timor=s needs in the matter of support?"
"Can it now state more specifically how it intends to act on its undertaking to support the reconstruction of East Timor?"
"Let me deal first with humanitarian aid."
"ECHO' s on-going aid amounts to EUR 5 million in two tranches of EUR 2 million and EUR 3 million."
"In addition ECHO is preparing a further decision to provide a significant amount for additional humanitarian assistance."
"These projects will cover food distribution, logistic support, water and sanitation, medical assistance, protection and security for the returnees and the transport of returnees from Dili to their place of origin."
"An essential element of humanitarian aid consists of food supply."
"A few days ago, the Commission reached agreement with the World Food Programme to supply 10,920 tons of maize and 1,240 tons of vegetable oil."
"This aid will cost EUR 8.5 million."
"As regards our support for the UN administration the Commission intends to give EUR 10 million support to the new UN trust fund for East Timor."
"Consultations with Member States are already under way."
"The Commission should take a formal decision by the beginning of December."
"Another visible demonstration of the Commission' s priorities in helping East Timor is the forthcoming visit at the end of this month of my colleague in the Commission, Mr Nielson, to East and West Timor."
"As to the long-term prospects for rehabilitation the report of the Commission' s representative who participated in the World Bank-led assessment mission to East Timor will be evaluated as soon as he returns to Brussels tomorrow."
"The Commission will keep the European Parliament informed about this."
"I see, incidentally, from this afternoon' s news agency reports that the World Bank has calculated after its mission that between USD 260 million and USD 300 million would be needed for medium-term reconstruction in ruined East Timor and that it will be seeking most of the funds from donors in Tokyo next month."
"We will be attending that donors' conference."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on 5 October, when we addressed the subject of the reconstruction of East Timor and in your answer to the MEP Mário Soares, you said, in this Chamber, and I quote: ""We have to put our money where our mouth is"" ."
"And I must say that I did not doubt that that was your intention, because this Chamber is familiar with your CV, particularly your time in Hong Kong, which shows an unswerving commitment to the defence of human rights and of a democratic system that is not confined to Europe alone."
"Nevertheless Commissioner, I would still like to ask you a question."
"In its budget, Parliament voted, at first reading, for an invitation to the Commission to set up a task force to manage the aid for the reconstruction of East Timor."
"I would like to ask you if the Commission is actually going to set in motion this task force to organise all the aid efforts for East Timor."
"I think the honourable Member would think it sensible for us to have taken part in the World Bank assessment mission and to wait for our officials who have been taking part in that assessment mission to report before we actually come to the budgetary authorities and ask for specific amounts of money."
"But I have no doubt at all that we will be expected to be sizeable contributors to the reconstruction of East Timor, though I imagine the honourable Member would agree with me that others should be contributors as well and I imagine that the honourable Member would also think it sensible for us to try to draw on the lessons of reconstruction activities elsewhere, not least in Kosovo to ensure that the money we deploy in East Timor is spent as effectively and rapidly as possible."
"I have to say that it gives me very great confidence that Sergio Vieira de Mello is to be the UN administrator in East Timor - he is somebody that I worked with very closely in my previous occupation in Hong Kong dealing with the refugee and illegal immigrant problem there."
"He is a man of outstanding qualities and we will all look forward to supporting him in the very important work he has to do."
"I just add this to the honourable Member - there is also an obligation on us to give some assistance to the new government in Indonesia as it tries to make the transition from authoritarianism to democracy."
"There are appalling social and environmental problems there - I would like to be able to help as much as possible."
"Then I look at the size of our Asia programme which runs at around EUR 350 million per year and I scratch my head about how we are going to be able to provide the level of assistance required to what may well be one of the very largest and most important democracies in the world."
"So I think we have to do our bit - in fact more than our bit - in East Timor and that we must also help in Indonesia about which we look forward to putting forward a communication to the Council in the early months of next year."
"Question No 44 by (H-0608/99):"
"Subject: Protection of EU companies' interests in Kosovo The Greek Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) and the Italian company STET International, owners of 49% of Srbija Telekom, are being threatened and harassed in Kosovo by the KLA and >others= in a bid to oust the two companies B the sole legal owners of network rights in Kosovo B from the region, in breach of international agreements."
"At the same time, Mytilinaios AE, which has invested more than $ 52 million in the >RMHK TREPCA= mines, is being obstructed and subjected to pressure with the ultimate aim of depriving the company of its contractual and real property rights in the mines."
"Given that EU companies are involved and that there are indications of covert support from EU representatives for these aims, what practical measures have been taken to safeguard the interests of the above companies and what guarantees will there be that they can pursue their activities without hindrance so that they are not supplanted by other companies and organised criminal interests?"
"To date, the Commission has not actually received reports of any threats or harassment of EU companies with interests in Kosovo by the KLA; however, if that were to happen, it would be brought to the attention of UNMIK and KFOR immediately."
"UNMIK which is responsible for the interim civilian administration of Kosovo is devoting considerable energy and resources trying to revive the Kosovan economy."
"This includes the reestablishment of a legal and institutional framework as well as coordinating the very considerable amounts of donor assistance that are supporting the economy."
"There is currently little or no economic activity taking place in the Trebce industrial complex including the mines which are being guarded by KFOR."
"Commissioner, as to whether or not there are reports, I have before me a written reply by Mr Dickson to a written question on these matters which bears the stamps and seals of all the organisations."
"However, that is by the by."
"The point is, it is only to be expected that, in a region in turmoil, there will be no particularly official record of the action, legal or otherwise, of certain systems with no legal status or authority."
"What is certain is that, if you were to inquire right now into the state of telecommunications in Kosovo, the answer would automatically come to light."
"You know full well that telecommunications in Kosovo, as a part of Serbia, were jointly owned by the Greek Telecommunications Organisation and the Italian company STET International and you also know full well what the situation is now."
"This investment is not therefore being protected."
"You know full well that the TREPCA mines were owned and operated by Mytilinaios and you know what the situation is now."
"And you should also consider in this respect that when the taxpayers of the European Union are asked to fund the reconstruction of Kosovo, while companies already established there are basically being threatened and have no protection, then this is a contradiction in terms and I would ask you to see it as such."
"Can I make it absolutely plain to the honourable Member that if he has specific information about threats to a company, if he can let me have them, I will take them up as soon as possible with both UNMIK and KFOR, because I would regard those threats as being extremely serious."
"I will be delighted to take charge of those papers."
"The honourable Member is entirely correct to point to the importance of the telecommunications industry in the very construction of economic activity in Kosovo."
"It is important to the whole economic future of that part of the Balkans, and I will certainly take notice of what he said in my contacts with Bernard Kouchner and with the UNMIK authorities."
"I would remind Members that this Question Time is for asking supplementary questions, not to explain doctrine to the Commission."
"This may suit the Commission, I do not know."
"But it is only for questions."
"Commissioner, you said at one point in your reply that UNMIK was endeavouring to create a legal and institutional framework for Kosovo."
"I should like to remind you that Kosovo has a legal and institutional framework and that it is still part of the Federation of Yugoslavia and that this has been acknowledged in a resolution by the United Nations Organisation."
"Of course, it has not escaped our notice that KFOR is acting as an occupying force, but Kosovo is still, albeit formally, a separate part of Yugoslavia."
"In the meantime, there have been numerous accusations of a series of infringements by KFOR which calls this status into question."
"I would be grateful for your comments."
"Well the honourable Member has been extremely imaginative because he asked a question about something I did not say."
"I do not recall using the words 'legal framework' at all in my answer but maybe there was some problem in translation."
"However, let me deal with his question and say without any hesitation that Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council has complete authority, there is no attempt to dilute it, as far as I am concerned, it is the basis of our activity in Kosovo, and I do not wish to depart from 1244 and its application by one centimetre."
"As for KFOR, I must say that on my visit to Kosovo, I was impressed by the relationship between KFOR and the civil authorities."
"KFOR is doing its best in extremely difficult circumstances and it deserves, for example, all our support in trying to ensure that there is no repetition of the sort of atrocity against both sides that has unfortunately disfigured life in Kosovo in the past."
"KFOR I repeat has been working well with the civil authorities and I am sure that will continue."
"Question No 45 by (H-0619/99):"
"Subject: Implementation of the nitrate directive Is the Commission (in particular the Commissioners for the Environment and Agriculture) aware that the European directive on nitrates (91/676/EEC) provides no conclusive guarantees with regard to the quality of ground water, as the directive concentrates exclusively on nitrates from animal dung and thus overlooks a number of other sources of nitrate?"
"Does the Commission agree that at present it seems almost impossible to implement the directive in full and on time, as it will cause problems in nine Member States?"
"Does the Commission appreciate that there is no exact way of monitoring implementation of the directive, as various methods of measurement are used within the EU?"
"As the implementation of the nitrates directive is causing problems in so many Member States, is the Commission prepared to give renewed consideration to improvements and a phased implementation so that the required standards on nitrates can ultimately be achieved?"
"This question is about whether the nitrates directive overlooks a number of other sources of nitrates."
"It is about whether it is impossible to implement, it is about monitoring and there is also question about if the Commission is prepared to give renewed consideration to improvements."
"This is my answer."
"The nitrates directive considers not only nitrogen from animal manure, but also from chemical fertilisers both as regards quantities supplied, see Article 5 and Annex III, and methods and periods of spreading and that is in Annexes II and III."
"The Commission is aware of the difficulties faced by several Member States in the implementation of this directive, but considers it to be an important element of its policy to tackle water pollution."
"In this context the Commission will continue to press for full implementation of the directive as requested by the Parliament resolution of 20 October 1998."
"The Commission is preparing monitoring and reporting guidelines with Member States which will allow comparisons and the aggregation of results and maps from the year 2000 when Member States report on the impact of their first action programmes."
"A complete study of eutrophication and groundwater problems and vulnerable zones designation by Member States has already been achieved by the Commission."
"All the necessary tools for the sound management of nitrogen at field and watershed level can be found in the existing directive as soon as it is properly implemented in all intensive agriculture and livestock areas of Europe."
"I thank you, Commissioner, for your response."
"But her response does not answer my questions."
"I asked her whether, if it appears that a large number of Member States do not or cannot yet meet the objective of the directive on account of large discrepancies in nitrate sources, both animal and artificial, should a different approach then not be opted for?"
"I have not received a reply to this question."
"Neither have I received a response to my question regarding infringement proceedings."
"If it appears that out of the fifteen Member States, there are at least nine in respect of which infringement proceedings have been initiated and if the Commissioner presses for the implementation of the directive, what do we do then?"
"Do we then enforce the legal instrument, is this what you want?"
"Or would you withdraw this?"
"Or would you just continue pressing for it?"
"I would greatly appreciate it if I could have a clear answer to all these questions, as they have been submitted in writing, in addition to these supplements."
"Of course we will insist that the directive be implemented."
"Now you could, of course, wonder whether the Commission would consider a short-term revision of the directive."
"The Commission believes that the majority of measures that have to be taken by Member States, for example, transposition monitoring, designation and codes of good practice, action programmes and reporting are straightforward."
"Most of the measures of Annex II and III are very efficient in reducing losses of, for example, phosphorus from agriculture, and the future water framework directive will complete this with a tool of management plans at watershed level."
"So, there is no need for new interim directives or the revision of the existing ones; instead we need increased pressure for their effective implementation at vulnerable zones and farm level."
"I think the directive could not be clearer, the problem still exists and is increasing, so we just have to continue along the same path."
"We have increased our legal pressure - 11 countries are currently concerned by infringement procedures at high level - the Court of Justice has recently condemned Italy and Spain, and thanks to this pressure things are now moving in a positive way."
"All countries must now transpose the directive."
"A new designation of vulnerable zones has recently occurred for Spain, Greece, Italy and the UK and the action programme contents have been strengthened in a number of countries."
"A general improvement in the situation can thus be expected within the next few years."
"I share my doubts with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten regarding the Commissioner' s replies but I do not intend to enlarge on this."
"At first reading, this Parliament earmarked a sum of EUR 250 million for the budget to facilitate the implementation of the nitrate directive."
"Even if Parliament only partly approves this at second reading, how does the Commissioner intend to spend this money?"
"I assume at least that she will take Parliament seriously."
"Commissioner, you must explain how you are going to spend the money."
"This is always a difficult question to answer, especially before this Parliament."
"The other questions which Members want to ask, such as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s question, will have to be asked in the lobby in a bilateral fashion."
"As you know the lobby is very important to political life."
"In the Chamber, we are only going to answer this question."
"I am glad to answer that question."
"I know what is behind it of course and the Commission is aware of the important economic and social efforts required in Member States with highly intensive production to adapt the structures and practices in agriculture to the requirements of the directive."
"Those difficulties were already anticipated in 1991 when the directive was signed under the Dutch Presidency."
"That is why Member States were given five years to prepare for adaptation and four more to achieve it and ensure the necessary reconversions were undertaken in a progressive fashion."
"In spite of this, we have some problems, but a new delay would not change the social consequences of the necessary measures."
"So it is very important that the countries implement this directive."
"There is a variety of funding at national and EU level - such as agri-environment and Structural Funds - and this may be used to help with reconversion and in the management of its social impact for a transitory period."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten should know that we are running out of time."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you have ten seconds."
"I only want to establish that our questions are not being answered."
"In fact, what I would like to ask is: if eleven Member States are unable to implement a nitrate directive and the Commission instigates infringement proceedings, what conclusions would you draw from this?"
"I am just wondering about that."
"This dialogue will now carry on outside the chamber, in writing or in a bilateral fashion, unless the Commissioner wants to reply within fifteen seconds."
"If not we will be depriving the other Members and Commissioners of the chance to speak."
"You have 15 seconds, Commissioner."
"If we decide on a directive to protect the environment against eutrophication, if we see that this is a very serious problem and that it is a growing problem, we have to take action."
"We have decided on a directive and the directive should be implemented."
"There are, of course, problems which were foreseen nine years ago when the directive was decided."
"It has been a very slow process in some countries and much faster in others."
"But the Dutch Government has to take measures to implement this directive, and that is what it is all about."
"It is really important to realise that you cannot pick and choose what you like but you have to implement the directive."
"Now we see that things are moving thanks to the legal instruments available to us and we just have to continue, because otherwise we will see much bigger problems of eutrophication."
"In the interest of all the Members who have come here today to ask questions, there will be no points of order unless there is disorder and everybody will adhere to the Rules of Procedure."
"I must fulfil my obligations."
"The question which Mr Pohjamo has asked affords me the opportunity of reminding you, ladies and gentlemen, of the method we use to draw up the list of Objective 2 eligible regions, as well as the programming arrangements, complying with the Regulations for the Structural Funds."
"As far as the list of eligible regions is concerned, Mr Pohjamo, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that the Commission sent a letter to the Member States on 1 July 1999, asking them to present their proposals by 31 August 1999."
"The least I can say is that we had not received many proposals by the time the deadline expired."
"So, Mr Pohjamo, I understand the concern which you are expressing, one which has been expressed most forcefully elsewhere by Mr Hatzidakis, the chairman, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Is there a risk that the delays of some Member States in putting forward their proposals will penalise those who made efforts to respect the time limits better than the others?"
"It is precisely so that we do not penalise the Member States who managed to submit their proposals at an earlier stage and in due form, complying with the terms of the Regulations, that the Commission has decided to approve the list in terms of groups of countries."
"So the Commission' s decision on eligible regions for Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland was taken on 26 October."
"Let me remind you, however, that this decision is a procedural one, since the Member States must be consulted via the committees, in accordance with the Regulations, before the final decision of the Commission may be taken."
"And it is only after the final decision that the programming process may begin, in negotiation between the Commission and the Member States."
"On this subject, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say that the Commission shall exercise the utmost pragmatism in working in this programming."
"So, for example, as I recently indicated to the Greek authorities in Athens, in programming the future appropriations, we shall be taking into account in quite a substantial manner the tragic consequences of the recent earthquake."
"I may say the same, with reference to current events in France, regarding the equally tragic consequences of the floods which have just occurred in four French departments."
"We can adjust or adapt the total appropriations allocated to each of the countries of the Union in order to take current events, particularly when they have such disastrous consequences, into account."
"The Regulations stipulate a period of four months for the economic development plans to be submitted by the national authorities, and a further period of five months for these proposals to be adopted."
"It is therefore expected that the first Objective 2 programmes shall be approved towards the middle of the year 2000."
"An identical process shall be followed for the eight remaining Member States to which Objective 2 still applies."
"However, due to the extended time limits for the approval of the lists - delays, as I have said, which the Commission is not responsible for - the programmes should be adopted in the second half of the year 2000, for most of these eight Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, not one programme will be in force by the 1 January 2000."
"I would, nonetheless, like to reassure the Members that may be concerned about this by specifying that there will be no interruption in the investment activity at local level since the resources for the current term, which has not yet run its course, must be committed in full by 31 December 1999."
"The implementation of projects for the previous period, which is due to expire on 31 December, will be continued for the next two years."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply."
"It is extremely important that the programmes in the area under discussion commence immediately at the beginning of 2000."
"EU aid will have an important impact on the development of regional industry and, for that reason, there should be no interruption between the old programmes and the new."
"I would still like to check that I understood correctly that these new programmes can start to be implemented, with the risk taken at national level, right from the start of 2000, as long, obviously, as the proper applications have been made beforehand."
"I believe, Mr Pohjamo, that we understand each other well."
"As far as your own country is concerned, matters are in particularly good order, since the first proposals were covered by the procedural decision of the Commission, on 26 October."
"We are at the stage of consulting the committees, made up particularly of the other Member States, and I shall therefore be able, by the end of the year, to propose a final, official decision for the approval of the Objective 2 zoning plan for your country, and also, probably, for the other three countries which were covered by the Commission' s initial decision on 26 October."
"These were Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands."
"So it will indeed be possible to make the investment commitments within the first half of next year, as soon as we have arrived, together with the authorities of your country, at the negotiations on the programmes."
"I am, of course, obliged to comply with the Regulations of the Structural Funds, but I am in a position to reassure you as far as your own country is concerned, Mr Pohjamo."
"My interest is to assess the efficacy of the EU in giving development aid to any of the third world countries."
"So will the Commission answer my questions if I take one of the third world countries as a model and try to assess how effectual our aid is and what the delegation does?"
"Mr Khanbhai, I am sorry to say that only questions which are supplementary to the question may be asked."
"Yours is a universal and all-encompassing question and therefore it cannot be asked today."
"Commissioner, allow me to say, as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that what you have told us about Objective 2 is most reassuring and a step in the right direction."
"With reference to what you said about natural disasters in Greece and France, perhaps you would be so kind as to clarify what you meant."
"So far, all we know is that the legal services have been hesitant on the matter of aid, shall we say, for the areas stricken by the earthquake in Greece, as far as housing is concerned."
"The legal services have agreed to provide aid for public infrastructures but they were hesitant on housing."
"We know that, previously in Italy, aid was also granted for some housing damaged by earthquakes."
"Does your statement mean that the Commission has changed its position and that there will be aid under the Community Support Framework for people whose houses were damaged?"
"It would be a great pity if I could not get my message across, because I have some useful things to tell you."
"Mr Hatzidakis, there has been no change in the Commission' s position."
"In tragic circumstances, such as those which some years past affected Portugal or Italy and, more recently, Greece - which I recently visited twice, once, a month ago, with my fellow Commissioner, Anna Diamantopoulou, and again just a few days ago - we are basing our attitude on the same Regulations of the Structural Funds and we are being accountable."
"You cannot ask the Commission to do anything other than comply with the Regulations ourselves and ensure that they are complied with by others."
"But, at the same, different responses are possible within the terms of these Regulations, and this is what I confirmed to the Prime Minister of your country, Mr Simitis, and to the other government ministers whom I met."
"Damage to public property in Greece following the latest earthquake on 6 September, and I am speaking from memory, are evaluated at approximately EUR 2.5 billion."
"In order not to compromise the considerable efforts undertaken in that country, particularly in terms of achieving budgetary stability, in preparation for its entry into the euro system, Greece called upon external appropriations of approximately EUR 1.9 billion."
"We calculated that EUR 1 billion of public expenditure was eligible within the terms of the Regulations of the Structural Funds."
"Right now, without any change to the Regulations, and this is the best way, EUR 1 billion in public expenditure was eligible for European aid, within the framework of the total appropriations allocated to Greece."
"We are going to redistribute and redeploy these appropriations in order to carry out the works necessary in the aftermath of the earthquake, and these works shall be subsidised on average up to 80%."
"For the rest, your country is probably, in the near future, going to receive a loan in the amount of EUR 900 million at an extremely advantageous rate from the European Investment Bank."
"My impression, then, and I mention this because it involves the question of solidarity among all the countries of the Union, is that, following the earthquake in Greece, there has been a good response in relation to material damage."
"It is not possible, naturally, to repair the human damage and the loss of life."
"No more than it is possible to do so in the context of the floods which have just struck France and which have caused dozens of deaths."
"I simply wish to say that in such cases I shall adopt a pragmatic approach in order to be able to adapt the programming of Objective 1 or Objective 2, according to the requests made by national authorities, in order to aid reconstruction in these countries."
"This is indeed a matter for regional development."
"As regards Objective 2, Italy has had a great many problems if we are to believe the press reports about its initial list of eligible items and areas."
"There was, apparently, a conflict between the Commission' s interpretation and that of the Italian authorities."
"I know that you have had a meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance."
"Can you tell us what the state of affairs is?"
"Has Italy compromised the launch of Objective 2 or did this meeting result in a possible compromise between the respective positions of the Commission and the Italian Government?"
"Mr Dell' Alba, I mentioned that four countries out of the twelve countries concerned by Objective 2, were covered by the Commission' s first procedural decision."
"Of the remaining eight countries, the situation of the Federal Republic of Germany has been more or less finalised in the discussions which we are having."
"As far as the other seven, including Italy, are concerned, we still have to check, on the basis of the proposals received by my department, country by country, that the proposed zoning plan in fact meets all the criteria of the Regulations of the Structural Funds."
"This is what you must ask of the Commission, and this is what I strive to do in a pragmatic manner and in a spirit of cooperation with each of the Member States."
"We are having a rather specific and difficult discussion with Italy, given the zoning plan which we have received and which actually, in one specific respect, does not comply with one of the rules adopted by the Heads of State and Government at Berlin."
"I would like to specify, if I have time, that a great deal of flexibility for every Member State is acceptable, but, in the zoning plan which will be adopted definitively under Objective 2, we must find at least half of the population which was initially identified as resident in zones eligible according to Community criteria."
"The zoning plan which I have received does not completely meet that criterion."
"I therefore had a very serious discussion with Minister Amato several days ago, and we agreed to continue the discussion, in a constructive spirit, in order to reconcile our points of view."
"I may say that this meeting was a very positive one and that we shall continue to work, in the weeks to come, to come up with a zoning plan for Objective 2 from the various regions of Italy, which is compliant with the Regulations."
"Question No 47 by (H-0628/99):"
"Subject: Violence against women Measures designed to tackle violence against women are often of a curative nature and target women and girls, e.g. support for hostels where women can seek refuge with their children, and rehabilitation of victims of violence."
"Such measures are necessary but we must go beyond the symptoms and the effects of violence in order to overcome the problem."
"Combating violence calls for a dual strategy. Violence must be combated by addressing the structural causes of violence B by focusing on men=s attitudes and behaviour B and by legislation which prohibits all violence against women, including domestic violence."
"Several Member States do not have such legislation at the present time."
"What practical measures will the Commission take to bring about legislation banning all violence against women and to combat the structural causes of violence against women?"
"Mr President, the Commission fully agrees with Mrs Theorin' s concern about the problem of violence against women and the need to give support to the rehabilitation of victims and their families."
"The issue of making such violence a crime and punishing it really falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"All forms of violence, whether against men, women or children, are banned in all Member States by their respective criminal codes."
"The Council of the Union, in its joint action of 24 February 1997 relating to action against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children requests Member States to revise the legislation and the practices in force in these areas in order to guarantee that the kinds of behaviour I have just referred to are subject to effective criminal punishment."
"At the end of this year, the progress achieved by Member States in this joint action will be debated in the Council."
"Since 1997, the Commission has been responsible for implementing the Daphne programme, which is specifically designed to combat violence against women, adolescents and children and which will be succeeded by the Daphne - 2000-2203 programme (approved this very day), which has the same objective."
"Underlying these initiatives is the pressing need to defend human rights, especially those of women and children."
"By means of the action I have just mentioned, the Commission has supported a raft of initiatives relating to the structural causes of violence, particularly the practises and behaviour of men, as well as actions assisting and rehabilitating the victims. And the Commission will continue in its endeavour to develop initiatives to this effect."
"The Commission is also responsible for the STOP programme, the aim of which is to provide the necessary training and information for professionals, particularly judges, for police forces and for social services departments in the fight against the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of women."
"Our main concern, apart from continuing in this direction, is to implement the Tampere European Council' s decision to come up with definitions, prosecutions and punishments for crimes of trading in human beings and crimes of abuse against children."
"The background to my question is very clear indeed: 15-25% of all women are battered during pregnancy; 50% of all women who are murdered are murdered by their husbands or partners; violence is the biggest cause of harm inflicted upon women, responsible for more deaths and injury than robberies and car accidents combined; and only 2-3% of all rapists are sent to prison."
"It is unfortunately the case that assaults upon women within the family are not illegal in all countries."
"It is important that there should be legislation of this kind."
"At the same time, it is also incredibly important to understand that it is men' s behaviour and attitudes which must be changed."
"It is on this matter that I should like to see the Commission take action."
"What, specifically, is one prepared to do to ensure that this structural cause of violence, that it to say, men' s behaviour, is changed?"
"What is one prepared to do to ensure that those countries which do not have legislation outlawing domestic violence against women in fact obtain such legislation?"
"Mrs Theorin, my opinion is clear and unequivocal: domestic violence against women must be equally sanctioned by means of criminal punishment."
"And this punishment is really the responsibility of each Member State' s legal system."
"The time to assess the situation that you have just described will be when, before the end of the year, the Council evaluates the results of the 1997 joint action on combating violence against women."
"As you have said, Mrs Theorin, and I agree with you, there are many different causes of violence: there are social causes, cultural causes, economic causes, and, at times, even political attitudes are to blame."
"It is true that, not just at the national level but also at the Community level, the main strategy that can be developed is that of reporting incidents, alerting people and providing information, all of which must be done by non-governmental organisations; we feel that the aim to which we have dedicated ourselves is to raise the awareness of public authorities, the police, to whom complaints are made or not made, and the judges, who have to judge each specific case, so that they all understand the criminal significance of violence against women, even when it is perpetrated within the family."
"And I think that some of the future Daphne programme' s concrete strategies will respond precisely to this concern."
"I wonder, if the Commissioner would agree that education is vital in terms of tackling violence against women?"
"I would ask him if he is aware of the project pioneered by the City of Edinburgh district council which is entitled 'zero tolerance on violence against women' ."
"This has been taken up by many local authorities."
"The campaign emphasises that violence, whether it be for social, cultural or economic reasons, is unacceptable and should be treated as such by local authorities, social workers and the police."
"Would he look at this programme and consider disseminating it throughout the Member States as an example of best practice in tackling this very difficult, but nevertheless, important area?"
"I fully agree with the honourable Member of the House that we have to tackle the causes."
"All such programmes are very useful to the Commission in evaluating the effective results of the actions that we are supporting with tax-payers' money."
"We should not rely on the idea that all we need to do is change the law."
"That is not true."
"Changing the law is a very important instrument to fight violence against women and children, but we need to go further."
"That is why we are laying great emphasis on the programmes on judicial and police cooperation to make the authorities - the policemen who deal with such cases every day - more aware of how to handle these kinds of incidents."
"I know that the various cultures in the Member States differ in their handling of this issue."
"In some Member States there is a certain tendency to regard as less relevant violence within the family."
"We have to put great emphasis on the fact that violence against women is always punishable."
"Question No 48 by (H-0631/99):"
"Subject: 1983 Convention on Compensation to Victims of Violent Crime The Commission recently called for all Member States to ratify the 1983 Convention on Compensation to Victims of Violent Crime."
"Which Member States have already done so and what action does the Commission intend to take to ensure that all Member States ratify this Convention?"
"Mr President, the Commission recently presented a communication to the Council, to the European Parliament and to the Economic and Social Committee, on the theme ""Victims of crime in the European Union - a reflection on standards and measures to be adopted"" ."
"In this text, the Commission puts forward ideas for a debate on standards for treating victims of crime in the European Union."
"One of the fundamental ideas in the Commission' s communication is precisely the ratification by all Member States of the Convention of the 1983 Council of Europe, and I am able to inform you, Mr Cushnahan, that this convention has been ratified by Germany, Denmark, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"Some Member States have already signed this convention but have not yet concluded the ratification process in accordance with their own laws."
"This is the case of Belgium, Greece, and Portugal."
"Finally, four Member States have not yet signed the convention. They are Austria, Spain, Ireland and Italy."
"Before the presentation of any proposal for specific action in this area, on the basis of the communication I have mentioned, the Commission invited the Member States, at Council level, and the European Parliament to state their observations on the points addressed in the communication on protection for victims of crime."
"I can tell you that this communication, made at the Council of Ministers of Justice and Internal Affairs of 4 October, was received very positively."
"The Commission awaits the opinions of Parliament and the Member States in order to develop further proposals for action to implement the objectives of the communication to which I have just referred."
"I am sure you agree with me that a victim of serious crime endures great pain and suffering, and this is doubly traumatic in a foreign country."
"I very much welcome the Commission communication."
"I welcome the range of proposals, not only as regards compensation but also the emphasis on the need for the availability of medical, psychological and counselling services for victims of crime."
"This Convention is dated 1983."
"We have had the Amsterdam Treaty which talks about creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"We have had the Tampere Summit."
"While I recognise that you want to use this communication and debate in Parliament as an instrument to increase pressure on the Member States, I would urge that you create that pressure now and not just wait until this document goes through all the necessary channels in the EU."
"People have already waited long enough."
"You should increase the pressure on the seven Member States which have either failed to ratify or failed to sign the Convention."
"I fully agree with the honourable Member."
"If you examine Conclusion No 32 of the Tampere European Council, it is quite clear that we have a mandate to put forward concrete measures within the legal framework of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I hope that by the end of the year we can get reactions from Member States and this Parliament so that we can start immediately at the beginning of the year 2000 putting forward specific European legislation on this issue as well as continuing to put pressure for the ratification of the 1993 Convention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, are there any statistics on violent crime and, above all, on compensation payments within the European Union and, particularly, developments in recent years?"
"That is precisely the purpose of the evaluation that we intend to conduct with the Council by the end of this year."
"At the end of the year, we will not only be able to evaluate the progress of national legislation to protect victims of violent crime but also the concrete measures that each Member State is willing to implement."
"They include compensation, psychological and medical treatment, assistance to victims in debt collection, the transmission of decisions from one Member State to another in order to improve the protection of victims, or asking courts to accept the written testimonies of victims who cannot attend court cases against their aggressors because they now live in another Member State."
"All those aspects will, I hope, be considered by the end of the year and will form the basis of the initiative that the Commission intends to take in the year 2000."
"Question No 49 by (H-0633/99):"
"Subject: Andalusia and the EU's new border policies There is an ever-increasing demand in Andalusia for EU action to deal with the major problems that are appearing there, on what is one of the Union=s southern borders."
"Andalusia is a comparatively disadvantaged region which is faced on a daily basis with disturbances arising from extremely high levels of illegal immigration, while it lacks the proper means to tackle, alleviate or resolve these problems."
"These are not local problems of Andalusia as such: they derive from the Union=s borders, and the responsibility for dealing with them should therefore lie squarely with the Union."
"However, to date the costs arising have been borne almost exclusively by this Objective 1 region (which should be a beneficiary, not a provider of funds), and it has proved virtually impossible to plan the financing of effective border policies."
"The Tampere European Council did indeed raise these problems, but has this been reflected in any concrete measures?"
"Will action finally be taken on the demands concerning economic and social development in northern Morocco and interregional cooperation programmes?"
"What concrete measures does the Commission intend to adopt in the forthcoming months with a view to introducing practical improvements on the Union=s Andalusian frontier?"
"What EU budget resources are to be allocated, and via which specific programmes?"
"Questions to Mrs De Palacio"
"Mr President, the Tampere European Council set guidelines for a common policy on asylum and migration."
"Its conclusions define the elements of a global approach, which it is important to put into practice straight away."
"To this effect, the Commission will have a special responsibility, both with regard to providing appropriate initiatives and generally following up the implementation of guidelines through its ""scoreboard"" system."
"One of the main political conclusions of the Extraordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government targets the need, in aiming for a genuine migration policy, to move beyond the traditional limits of justice and internal affairs and to have recourse to a series of instruments within the scope of other Union policies, an idea that has been promoted by the Commission since 1994 and which has always merited the support of the European Parliament."
"The same thing applies to relations with third countries of origin and of transit."
"The European Council confirmed the renewal of the high level group' s mandate on asylum and immigration, whilst insisting that the plans already adopted be implemented."
"You all know that one of these plans concerns Morocco and includes numerous recommendations, particularly in the area of economic development, which are in line with the concerns expressed in Mrs Izquierdo Rojo' s question."
"Over the next few weeks, the Commission, in close collaboration with Member States, will be making an inventory of the measures currently in force or still to be adopted that are likely to contribute to the implementation of the measures to which I just referred."
"I do not think, then, that it can be considered that this initiative constitutes the Commission' s only contribution in this area."
"Indeed, the Commission has for several years paid special attention to the development of the provinces in Northern Morocco, at a time when technical and financial cooperation with the Kingdom of Morocco has been implemented."
"In this way, around half the funds of the MEDA programme were allocated to these northern provinces between 1996 and 1999, and this represents projects to a total value of EUR 330 million."
"Apart from this, under the third and fourth financial protocols as well as under other budget headings, several projects have been or are taking place in this region at a cost equivalent to more than EUR 80 million."
"In addition to this, the Community initiative INTERREG-II has already financed cooperation actions between Spain and Morocco during the current programming period, including a specific cross-border programme between Andalusia and Morocco."
"It is a matter of encouraging the development of cooperation between countries, under the auspices of the new Community initiative INTERREG-III for the period 2000-2006, which will continue to finance cross-border cooperation within the European Union and with third countries."
"In the case of the cross-border region of Spain and Morocco, it is incumbent upon both the Spanish and Moroccan authorities, in partnership with the Commission, to identify common priorities for action for the period 2000-2006."
"I am very grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his very encouraging reply and I hope to see that list of specific items which he has said we will have before long."
"However, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission has realised that there will have to be complementarity between the INTERREG and MEDA programmes so that the associated country - in this case Morocco - may have the financial means necessary for cooperation."
"I would ask the Commissioner to deal with this issue, so that it may be possible to promote complementarity between the INTERREG programme and the MEDA programme, because otherwise, Morocco will not have the financial means intended for cooperation."
"This is done with the CCEE countries and it will be necessary to do the same with this new form of cross-border cooperation."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I am in complete agreement with you and I believe that the conclusions of the Tampere European Council highlight the fact that there is a horizontal approach between pillars which includes immigration and asylum policies and the other policies of the European Union, amongst which we have development aid policy."
"I am sure that the Commission will guarantee the cohesion of the Union' s external and internal policy - of cross-border programmes and development aid programmes - and also that it is in the interest of the States benefiting from cross-border cooperation - Morocco and Spain - that proposals be put forward which will address the same concern."
"I believe that this new approach to the coordination of internal and external policies, and of the programmes which are related to one or other of those policies, may be a very positive step forward in terms of Union action in these fields."
"The border between Andalusia and Gibraltar has been the scene of absurd and inordinately long delays over the last several months."
"What steps is the Commission taking or going to take to ensure that travellers can freely and easily move across this internal EU border without undue formality?"
"I am most obliged to you for treating me so kindly and I can assure the honourable Member that as far as Gibraltar is concerned - I do not feel Morocco is particularly involved - the Commission is following very closely not only the situation on the border but also the dialogue between the UK and Spanish Governments on the Gibraltar situation."
"I sincerely feel that within a short period of time we will be able to take decisions on some of the complaints that have been put to the Commission about those delays."
"Meanwhile, I am very hopeful about the direct dialogue now under way between the United Kingdom and Spain."
"Question No 50 by (H-0606/99):"
"Subject: Transport policy/aviation Delays are becoming an increasingly common feature of air traffic in Europe."
"According to the latest IATA statistics, the number of air passengers in Europe has risen by 6% in 1999."
"This has been accompanied by a 74% increase in the number of delays."
"The EU is not prepared for the twofold increase in the number of aircraft movements that is set to take place over the next ten years."
"Events this summer gave an indication of the chaos that could soon be commonplace."
"There are currently 66 national and local air traffic control centres in Europe."
"What is needed is a common European airspace and a joint air traffic control system."
"Given that there is little time left, the Commission must act immediately."
"What does the Commission plan to do in order to prevent the air traffic chaos in Europe from getting even worse next year?"
"I have to say that both President Prodi in this Chamber, last July, and myself on other occasions, have stated that the air traffic situation in Europe is untenable."
"We really need to make progress in this area if we want to provide real solutions to the problems we are faced with."
"And I believe that all of you, as regular air passengers, know exactly what we are talking about."
"The Commission is completing a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the delays which have occurred in air traffic management."
"To this end, I intend to present an action plan specifically to promote real changes which can respond to the demands which we have to address."
"Without anticipating the Council' s final decision, it is clear that our objective is no less than that of creating a single European airspace: fifteen countries under one sky."
"How can we achieve this?"
"Firstly, there are measures under way which must be pursued and promoted, such as the European Community joining Eurocontrol, a process which will not only call for greater political responsibility on the part of the European Union but also that the last convention will be implemented and therefore measures may be adopted by majority voting, by majorities and not the systematic use of unanimous assent."
"We do not believe that this measure is a panacea, but we think that it is essential in responding to this issue."
"Secondly, in the area of Eurocontrol, and not only in that of Eurocontrol but also in other areas, we must guarantee efficiency and transparency in the operations of air service providers and furthermore clearly separate regulatory responsibilities from the provision of services."
"Air traffic management cannot be an exception in relation to the other public service sectors which have had to face up to the single market."
"There is a third aspect to be dealt with: better distribution of the civil and military use of the airspace of the fifteen countries."
"In that respect, there is a need for greater flexibility and greater cooperation in order improve management and the use of that airspace."
"The ambition is to try to prevent the chaos which, according to all the forecasts, we are inevitably going to suffer during the next summer season."
"To this end, I intend to deal with this issue at the next Ministerial meeting of the European Civil Aviation Authority Conference, which will take place on 28 January, and, as I mentioned before, the Commission' s communication on this subject will be presented to Parliament at the end of this year and to the Council of Transport Ministers, specifically at the meeting of 6 December."
"Allow me, first of all, to thank the Commissioner for her answer which I think sounds very positive."
"It is now really however a question of translating words into action."
"Where this is concerned, we naturally have high hopes of the Commission."
"It is a fact that air traffic over Europe has seen a period of very considerable delays."
"This is to a very large extent due to the fact that the number of flights is increasing very dramatically just now."
"This year alone, the increase has been close on 6%."
"If delays are to be avoided, what is now really required is the ability to take political action."
"It is only to be hoped that the Commission has this."
"The Commissioner is saying here that we need to ensure that we get a common system of air traffic control in Europe."
"I think that is extremely important."
"In the long term, we cannot have 66 different national or local bodies dealing with the matter. Instead, one body is needed."
"I therefore think it is good that the Commissioner is now talking along those lines."
"Allow me just to ask a short follow-up question. When does the Commissioner consider we are likely to have implemented such a system?"
"The intention is to obtain support firstly for the proposal which I am going to make - both to the Commission and in time, if the Commission accepts it, to the Council of Ministers and Parliament - so that we will not only proceed with the incorporation of the Commission into Eurocontrol, but will also forward in the area of the fifteen countries to try to achieve a single airspace and, therefore, common management of that single space by those fifteen countries."
"If I obtain the support of the Commission, the intention would be to promote a high level group in which the main civil authorities would participate, and the military would perhaps have to take part, in order to help the Commission to develop suitable guidelines."
"But that is not all."
"We would also need to promote a dialogue with the principal operators - not only air companies and users, but also air traffic controllers and all the airports etc. That is to say, all those operators who participate within the complex world of air traffic."
"As you have said, some of the delays can be attributed to air traffic control, to the management of air traffic, which accounts for more or less 50% of the delays, and the other 50% is shared between air companies and internal problems in the management of the airports themselves."
"But I believe that we should act on all fronts."
"We should act in the short term with urgent measures."
"This includes achieving distribution and greater flexibility in the management of airspace in its civil and military uses - and in certain countries this can be achieved with a certain speed, we have to promote it and we are working on it - and, also in the short term, intervening in the management by airports and air companies of their flight forecasts and the organisation of their flights, in order to improve the use and efficiency of airport slots."
"But we also have to act in the medium term, I insist, with a more ambitious measure; this single airspace and this common management of the single airspace by the fifteen Members."
"And then we will make it more extensive, within the framework of Eurocontrol as well. It will cover wider European areas given that a larger number of these countries are asking to join the Union and will become part of it in the years to come."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her very bold replies."
"Mr President, I would like to refer back to the questions."
"Regarding the demarcation which the Commissioner would like to introduce between civil and military aviation, could she manage this before the coming holiday season?"
"My second question concerns the proposals of the high level group, could this be possible in the short term?"
"Could a date be indicated for this, if possible?"
"Competence for the civil and military issue lies with the Member States and, therefore, what the Commission can do is urge the Member States to implement this greater cooperation, promote it and assist in any every possible way: we are working with the different Member States one by one."
"As for the high level group, if the Commission and the Council approve it - as I have already said, the Commission will foreseeably do so on the 24th of this month, and the Council on 6 December - the intention would be that it would start its work at the beginning of February or even at the end of January."
"It would be useful if a measure of this type could receive some kind of support from the European Council in Helsinki."
"Question No 51 by (H-0613/99):"
"Subject: Progress with reorganisation of Olympic Airways In October 1994, the Greek Government, in collaboration with the Commission, launched a programme to reorganise Olympic Airways."
"What are the causes of the problems involved in implementing this programme? What stage has been reached in talks with the Greek authorities and what are the plans for the immediate future?"
"I would ask the Commissioner to be as specific as possible - I know she is doing so - because we are out of time."
"Our controls, not in terms of air transport but in terms of speaking, have not worked properly."
"Questions to Mr Verheugen"
"The Commission, through its decision of 7 October 1994, authorised the granting of considerable aid for the reorganisation of Olympic Airways."
"As always, this authorisation implied certain obligations on the part of the company, obligations intended to guarantee the genuine recovery of the company and limit the impact on competition and the single market."
"Unfortunately, these obligations have not been fulfilled and, consequently, the Commission had to reopen the case in 1996."
"The Greek authorities once again made additional commitments so that new aid could be authorised during 1998 and thereby unblock the last batch of aid to Olympic Airways which is still pending."
"Nevertheless, the report on the reorganisation presented in April of this year indicated that the financial results of the company were below the forecasts."
"This led the Greek authorities to order the drawing up of a new reorganisation plan by a new team led by specialist managers."
"As soon as the Commission receives that new reorganisation plan - we hope that this will be during this month of November - we will examine the content of the new commitments and we hope that they will give sufficient guarantees to allow the granting of the funds which are still pending."
"Commissioner, it is clear from your reply that difficulties still surround Olympic Airways, as they have since 1994."
"In the meantime, Greece has granted the company several billion drachmas in state aid."
"And yet the problem persists."
"I think that the Greek taxpayer is entitled to know what difficulties the Commission has encountered with respect to Olympic Airways and what problems it has encountered, given that these problems have, at times, made it extremely hesitant with respect to the demands of the Greek authorities and, if I have understood your reply correctly, continue even now to make the Commission hesitant on the matter of the third instalment of aid for Olympic Airways."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a series of decisions were taken in 1994 - specifically to grant aid to various European companies - with the aim of carrying out the reorganisation of those companies which would allow, on the one hand, their possible privatisation but, in any case, to put a definitive end to the State subsidies and aid which, to a certain extent, distorted the single market and free competition between the different operators in the deregulated air market."
"This aid was given on the condition that the companies were managed commercially - and therefore that the administrations and authorities of those countries would not be involved - that a suitable process of reorganisation would be carried out and that, finally, we would have viable companies which could develop without the need for new public aid."
"The reality is that - according to the information provided by the Greek authorities themselves - there has been an excessive involvement of the Greek administration in the management of the company, and the commitments of 1998 should have put an end, once and for all, to this situation."
"The granting of aid other than that authorised, which has happened over recent years, has been aimed, above all, at the funding of the social element of the reorganisation plan, and specifically supplementary compensation for employees made redundant."
"Therefore, there was a reduction in the aid authorised in 1998, in such a way that the total allocation did not increase."
"It is considered that this aid for social purposes should be deducted from the total amount which was granted to Olympic Airways."
"And lastly, I have to say that the financial results of the company in 1998 are disappointing."
"They have led to the current Greek authorities taking a very important decision, specifically the appointment of a new board of directors, turning to experts from other companies - that is, Speedway, a subsidiary of British Airways - which must update the company' s recovery plan and which, I am sure, will be able to offer us over the next month, sufficient information and the necessary guarantees so that, once and for all, we can authorise the last batch of aid to Olympic Airways and ensure that it takes off correctly and takes to the air without any great problems."
"Thank you, Mrs De Palacio."
"Given the total lack of time, we are obliged to move on to the questions to Commissioner Verheugen."
"Therefore, Questions No 52 to 55 will be replied to in writing in the shortest time possible."
"I ask for the Members' forgiveness."
"Question No 56 by (H-0625/99):"
"Subject: Commission's efforts to further the applicant countries' preparations in the enlargement process The association of the Central and Eastern European countries with the EU and, thereby, their association with the internal market will entail competitive pressure precipitating structural changes in those countries."
"To achieve political and economic stability, enhance social welfare for the citizens of the applicant countries and prevent the risk of social dumping in the present Member States, the applicant countries will need to modernise their social security systems if enlargement is to be successful."
"The Union=s initiatives in this respect will in turn have a bearing on the applicant countries= ability to modernise and on our common interest in achieving an effective enlargement as quickly as possible."
"Can the Commission provide a progress report on the applicant countries= preparations for modernising their social security systems and can it also report on present and planned measures to further the applicant countries= efforts in this respect?"
"Mr President, the Commission is clear about the importance of the reform of social security systems in the applicant countries in the context of their accession to the EU."
"With the exception of the rights of itinerant workers and the coordination of regulations concerning them, the acquis communautaire relating to social security is not very extensive."
"As the Commission' s Communication of 14 July 1999 on the modernisation of social security systems shows, efforts are being made to further develop the acquis communautaire."
"The applicant countries must be incorporated into this process."
"In its annual reports, which were presented to the Council and Parliament on 13 October, the Commission draws up a balance in this regard for the situation in the applicant countries."
"The Commission establishes that although modernisation in the social sector and in health is generally only progressing slowly, efforts are being made to achieve strong social security nets."
"Changes have recently been made in the social security systems and health insurance systems in Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Bulgaria and Poland."
"These are considerable, but they are still not enough."
"This leads the Commission to continue to implement the reform programmes for the social security systems in the applicant countries."
"These programmes are known as Consensus 1 and Consensus 2."
"They are to be continued in addition to the technical aid which most of these countries have already received in the form of national PHARE appropriations."
"From the year 2000 the reform and modernisation of the social security systems in the applicant countries might also be supported with the Consensus 3 programme."
"As of this year, i.e. 1999, this sector will be given EUR 18.6 million in support."
"These funds are for institutional improvements in the social sector in the accession countries, the policy of partnerships playing an important role."
"Within the framework of accession partnerships the strengthening of administrative structures for coordinating social security in the States of Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Cyprus, Slovakia, Malta, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia has been given medium-term priority."
"The European Commission has also repeatedly pointed out to the applicant countries the useful role which social partners could play in the accession process and has also reminded them that greater consideration for social problems means that it is necessary to develop social dialogue in the applicant countries."
"I share the Commissioner' s view that these questions are important, that a lot remains to be done and that we ourselves must also modernise our social security systems and link the questions concerning enlargement of the Union to this process."
"I have a follow-up question which can partly be linked to what the Commissioner said just now in his answer and which concerns the role of the social partners in the labour market in, among other things, preventing social dumping."
"The question is this: is it true that the Commission is demanding of the applicant countries that they should establish some form of social dialogue, for example through the three-party cooperation which we have in the present Member States?"
"Are demands of this kind now being made of the applicant countries as part of the accession process?"
"The term ""promote"" is probably not appropriate in this context."
"We are negotiating here with sovereign states."
"The ways and means with which we interact with our partners are not such that I would like to use the term ""promote"" , particularly concerning something for which there is no acquis."
"We can of course expect, as it is the basis for association, that the accession candidates take on everything which is legally regulated in the European Union."
"However, what goes on in terms of social interaction is not legally regulated."
"In this case, political dialogue, which is also a part of the accession strategy, repeatedly makes reference to the need for intensive social dialogue."
"We have done this in the past and we will continue to do it in the future, in which regard I would also like to point out to you that in this matter the situation is very different, that is in no way do the majority of the accession candidates fall short of the standard of the Member States."
"Question No 57 by (H-0627/99):"
"Subject: Enlargement of the EU and the Schengen Agreement The applicant countries must adopt EU rules on visa requirements and border controls on accession to the EU, which will entail considerable changes for several of those countries, in particular the possibility of requiring visas and stricter border controls in regard to neighbouring countries."
"Has any analysis been made of the changes this will require of those applicant countries which have embarked on negotiations?"
"Is there a list of the neighbouring countries for whose citizens the current applicant countries will have to introduce a visa requirement?"
"Have any exemptions/transitional arrangements been discussed to facilitate the changes?"
"In connection with the opening of the accession negotiations on 31 March 1998, the Commission, in tandem with the applicant countries concerned, carried out an analytical evaluation of the EU' s acquis communautaire."
"The controls on external borders and the visa policy of the EU were treated within the framework of Chapter 24 of the accession negotiations concerning cooperation in the sectors of justice and internal affairs."
"The evaluation showed that further progress is to harmonise the acquis communautaire."
"An additional need for reform was also established in the course of the expert missions organised by the Commission, in which representatives of the administrative and justice authorities took part."
"The applicant countries are obliged to take on and apply the acquis communautaire of the EU at the time of accession."
"This also therefore applies to the visa list applicable at the time of accession, which the Council establishes after consultation with the European Parliament."
"Concerning the issue of transitional regulations which might be applied for by the applicant countries within the framework of this Chapter of the accession negotiations, the basic negotiating stance of the European Union is that such measures are only possible in exceptional cases and only for a limited period and scope."
"The transitional regulations must not entail any amendments to the provisions and policies of the Union, must not hinder their trouble-free implementation and must not have any significant impacts on competition."
"Thank you for your detailed answer."
"This is, in fact, quite a difficult and sensitive question which may also create a number of problems for those applicant countries which are compelled to introduce a more restrictive policy towards neighbouring countries which they would really like to be more open towards."
"My follow-up question concerns whether, in the present situation, any of the applicant countries has requested exemption from the list of countries in connection with which visas are required, whether the matter has in any particular case been very specifically discussed."
"I should also like to hear whether you consider it likely that it will be possible to remove internal border controls with the new Member States from the first day of their membership."
"But of course."
"That is the whole point, but under certain preconditions."
"Firstly, with regard to the visa obligation we do not want to allow any exceptions."
"The Council regulation is clear on this."
"If we make exceptions here, then we are giving up the basic principle of a uniform area of freedom, security and justice."
"I must point out at this juncture, as you have rightly said, that the subject is highly sensitive."
"The sensitivity is not just in the fact that it is difficult for the candidates to implement this."
"The greatest sensitivity is in the fact that I know a number of Member States which will not accept enlargement unless there is total clarity in this matter."
"We need not just the agreement of the candidate countries, but also of the Member States, and for most Member States this is a crucial point on which no compromise is possible."
"With regard to controls on external borders, the applicant countries expect that on accession they will take on and apply the acquis communautaire of the EU, as I have said."
"The controls on internal borders will only be abolished if the EU confirms that the applicant country can fully guarantee effective implementation of the acquis communautaire of the EU in this matter."
"However, your question was whether internal controls will disappear?"
"The answer is a definite yes."
"That is what it is all about!"
"Question No 58 by (H-0638/99):"
"Subject: Alignment of laws in the Czech Republic Is the Commission aware of a study concerning the slow pace at which the transposition and alignment of laws is proceeding in the Czech Republic, drawn up and addressed to it by four Czech opposition parties?"
"Mr Posselt, the Commission is aware of the study submitted by four Czech opposition parties on the alignment of laws in the Czech Republic."
"However, I must point out that this study was first presented to the press and to the Czech public before a copy was given to the EU delegation in Prague."
"I myself did not receive a copy, not even when I met the previous week in Prague with representatives of the parties which produced the study. Unfortunately, therefore, I cannot personally speak about the contents of this study."
"Mr President, I find that very interesting."
"I was told that this study had been sent to you personally."
"But irrespective of that I would like to say that I support these four opposition parties and also many social democrats who fully advocate European integration."
"I also regret the resignation of Mr Lansky, who worked hard in this matter, but I do see the danger of a debate arising in the Czech Republic and I would like to mention this to you."
"It has been said by another party which previously governed, a large opposition party, that there could be membership à la carte; there is talk of a status being accorded which is akin to that of Turkey, of a political discount, and I would like to ask you whether you consider such thinking plausible or whether you presuppose full implementation of the acquis communautaire."
"I must object to the element of doubt in your question as to whether I actually received the paper."
"If I tell you that it was not sent to me and that no mention was made of it at the discussions in Prague, then you must believe me."
"Good, then I am satisfied."
"It sounded otherwise."
"Regarding the question: I had a detailed discussion with the Chairpersons of the parties which you mentioned last week in Prague."
"I also had discussions with other leading members of these parties."
"I would not describe this in the harsh way that you did as the policy of the largest non-governing party in the Czech Republic, since that is who we are talking about."
"Nevertheless, it is known that the previous Prime Minister Klaus, who is the leader of this party, has different views on the nature of the European Union from the current government and most of the parties represented in the Czech parliament."
"From the point of view of the EU, I can only say that the same applies to the Czech Republic as to all other candidates."
"The strategy is that the applicant countries must and wish to become full members with full rights and with full responsibilities."
"The completely mistaken notion of membership à la carte, partial membership or anything else was at no time and in no place suggested by representatives of the Czech Republic in the negotiations with the Commission."
"We are negotiating with the Czech Republic as with all others."
"In connection with your question I would like to also point out that I have a certain hope that the extremely marked polarisation in the Czech Republic will prove surmountable."
"In any case, the result of my visit last week was that, interestingly, all the parties represented in the parliament, including the extreme right and the extreme left, publicly declared, on the occasion of my visit, that they support the government' s policy of European integration."
"It was very interesting to hear that they support this policy and, this is the crucial point, are prepared to rapidly develop processes which can ensure that the very complex procedure of aligning Czech laws can be carried out somewhat quicker in the future."
"Questions Nos 59 to 115 will be replied to in writing."
"Mr Posselt has the floor for a procedural motion."
"I would ask you to be concise and that another additional dialogue results from it."
"Mr President, I would just like to say on a personal note that it was the furthest thing from my mind to suggest that the Commissioner had not received the paper and had lied, although it was stated publicly in the Czech Republic that this study had been sent to you and that you had not yet responded."
"This was the reason for my question and I thank you for clearing up the matter."
"I did not mean to suggest anything."
"There must be reasons why you did not receive it, but I never suggested that you had lied!"
"We thank Mr Posselt for this clarification, which I hope the Commissioner has listened to very attentively."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, some Members of the House did not hear me yesterday speaking about the terrible floods which occurred in the departments of south-west France."
"I did actually do this, I said how affected we were by this tragedy and I added that, of course, we are going to ask the Commission to take appropriate action, both to provide assistance for the victims of these disasters and also to add to the arrangements set in place by the government concerned."
"I did, in fact, also mention the terrible earthquake in Turkey."
"I wished, then, to reiterate this message in your presence."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Barón Crespo wishes to make a comment."
"I was welcoming Mr Solana."
"Yes, of course, we shall be welcoming him to the House presently."
"You see, Mr Solana, what a welcome!"
"Are there any comments relating to the Minutes?"
"Madam President, in the vote on amendment 7 of Mr Smet' s report, it is recorded that I voted against. This is an error and my vote should be recorded as being in favour."
"Very well, Mr Nogueira Román, we shall make that correction."
"The three Members of the Greek Communist Party will be leaving the Chamber in protest at the presence today of Mr Solana who, as Secretary-General of NATO, is one of those chiefly responsible for the crimes committed against Yugoslavia, and because of the fact that he has been appointed ""Mr CFSP"" ."
"Mr Korakas, your comment has nothing to do with the Minutes."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, I am taking the floor in order to welcome Mr Solana, of course, but also to ask about the deadline for the submission of amendments with regard to the OLAF report which is on today' s agenda."
"As non-attached Members, we find it particularly difficult to collect the requisite signatures, as you know."
"We would therefore like to know when the deadline is for the submission of amendments to the Napolitano report."
"A period of 24 hours, as stipulated in the Rules of Procedure?"
"Yes, of course."
"Statement by Mr Solana"
"The next item is the statement by Mr Solana on the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We are particularly delighted, Mr Solana, to welcome you to this Chamber for the first time."
"We are extremely keen to establish a relationship of very close cooperation with you and it is with great pleasure that I now give you the floor."
"Thank you, Mr Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Thank you, once more, for attending the House in this capacity - since you have already attended in the past in another role - and thank you, too, for your contribution and for the desire which you have expressed and demonstrated, Mr Solana, for very close cooperation with this House."
"I am extremely pleased to be taking part for the first time in a debate in the European Parliament with the High Representative."
"We are all extremely fortunate that he is the man charged with the key responsibility for developing a more effective and coherent European security and defence policy."
"He has, as the House will know, a huge and wholly deserved international reputation for standing up for the values which have been responsible for the best of European history in this century and whose absence has been responsible for the worst of our history as well."
"The High Representative and I have spent a good deal of our first weeks in our respective jobs considering together the terrestrial problems 30,000 feet below our aircraft seats - so much travel."
"It reminds me that Lord Grey, the British Foreign Secretary for ten years at the beginning of the century, only ever went abroad once."
"If my history does not let me down, that visit was shortly followed by the outbreak of the first world war."
"I suppose Lord Grey was regarded as well-travelled."
"Perhaps with all the travelling we do these days we are better informed than he was, but perhaps we are not."
"I do not wish to repeat all the points which have been so well made by the High Representative, but since you have invited me to take part in this debate, something which I greatly welcome, I should like to say a few words about the Commission' s view of the building of a European security and defence policy."
"Security and defence, which are at the heart of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, are also properly and inevitably close to the hearts of Member States."
"As was clearly apparent at the historic meeting - it is the High Representative' s adjective and the correct one - at the beginning of this week of the General Affairs Council attended by defence ministers, Member States believe that enhanced cooperation in the security and defence area in the European Union will bring two major benefits."
"First, it will enable everyone to make better use of their resources and, secondly, it will mean that everyone packs a bigger punch precisely because Member States are working more closely together."
"These benefits are needed more than ever in the security field because more is expected of Europe today."
"More is expected of us by the rest of the world because of our economic success and because of our success too in building peaceful and stable democracies."
"More is expected of us, in my judgement, by our own citizens, who do not think of Europe just in terms of balance sheets and GDP figures."
"How could they possibly do so given the tumultuous political events of the last few years - tumultuous events ever since an American political scientist told us that history had ended."
"The European Union has to rise to the level of events."
"It is as simple as that and as difficult as that."
"The Amsterdam Treaty and the Cologne Declaration represent a formidable challenge."
"But we, in the Commission, want to play our part in helping to meet it."
"Of course we have no military role."
"The sight, on Monday evening, of so many military uniforms in the margins of the General Affairs Council came as an interesting cultural development."
"But what we do have in the Commission is the means and the experience to make an important contribution to the non-military dimension of security."
"The so-called Petersberg Tasks suggest a comprehensive package of crisis-management measures where Community instruments can interact with traditional diplomacy and, if necessary, the use of military force."
"Here we come to a crucial point."
"Sometimes the military dimension is essential and decisive."
"But the non-military dimension can also be crucial."
"After all, the nature of conflict has changed so radically during this bloody century."
"Eighty-five percent of the victims of the first world war were soldiers."
"Only 15% were civilians."
"The situation in conflicts today is almost the opposite."
"It is equally the case that with the increasing sophistication and interdependence of our societies, economic measures, the free flow of information and so on have become ever more important in conflict and its prevention."
"So the European Union has to envisage action right across the whole range of instruments at its disposal, both military and non-military."
"If you want to know just what we can contribute as a Community, look at the multitude of our operations in the Balkans."
"We are involved in obvious areas like humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and reconstruction."
"But the measures we can take with the aim of preventing conflict and human suffering include many other things as well, like law enforcement, institution-building and trade policy."
"Those are the sort of things we are supporting in Kosovo, to which we will be pledging at the donors conference in Brussels today another contribution of EUR 500 million from the Community."
"So what I want to make clear is that you do not have to strain or stretch your imagination, let alone strain or stretch the Treaties which determine our activities, to see the absolutely clear roles that can be played by the Commission and by Parliament."
"It is not just in south-east Europe that we have seen the need for coordinated military and civil crisis management both at Union level and between Member States."
"We can also see that in East Timor."
"We have to improve our ability as a Union and as Member States to manage crises and to contribute to those international organisations which are also active in this, alas, all too necessary area."
"The Helsinki European Council will discuss an integrated approach to conflict management and we are, as a Commission, making a full contribution to that discussion."
"Let me make a point that some may regard as rather prosaic."
"In conflict prevention and crisis management, time is of the essence."
"The new Commission has begun work to try to improve the effectiveness and speed of response of the instruments that we have in crisis situations."
"That is something which Parliament has frequently requested us to do, and absolutely rightly."
"It is a big job."
"In many respects, any progress we make in this area would represent by far the biggest contribution that I could make to our rather more heroic objectives."
"I hope that we can count on the continued support of Parliament in developing more flexible and more rapid procedures, and as the High Representative I am sure would readily agree, I lose no opportunity to make the same point to the Council."
"The Commission' s role in crisis management is clear, but our role goes beyond crisis management."
"A European security and defence policy cannot be developed in the absence of a competitive and open European defence industrial and technological base."
"This is also in the interests of the European Union' s partners."
"We in the Commission can contribute to this with a range of instruments in areas such as public procurement, the internal market, research and competition."
"I want to make one final point."
"Sometimes people talk about the potential institutional conflicts in the foreign and security tasks which lie ahead. I hope they will not take exception to these remarks but I think that the issues they are talking about are too important to allow them to get mangled by diplomatic lawyers."
"Plainly, we have to build on the institutional framework of the Union."
"Plainly, military and non-military matters cannot be neatly compartmentalised."
"Plainly, the Commission must play its full part in crisis management even when there is a military component, because there will also be a non-military component."
"Plainly, the new structures must enable the Commission to exercise its full right of initiative."
"Plainly, the Commission is not a college of amateur chiefs of staff and plainly, we want to work successfully with the High Representative and with Parliament to ensure that Europe has the security and defence policy that it needs and that its citizens want."
"And if there is another plainly left in the dictionary, it is this: so long as I have my present responsibilities, no cigarette paper, or perhaps after David Byrne' s announcement on tobacco yesterday I should say no piece of tissue paper, is going to separate the Commissioner for External Relations from the High Representative."
"Madam President, this is the first time that the Secretary-General and High Representative, who is also to be the Secretary-General of the West European Union, has been here with us in the Parliament."
"You bring with you, Mr Solana, exceptional credentials for these duties."
"You have been President-in-Office of the Council and Secretary-General of NATO."
"Our Group wishes you every success, both personally and in your work; if you are successful, it means success for us all and success for Europe."
"The European Christian Democrats and Conservatives wish you a warm welcome to your new duties."
"You said that if ever it was necessary you would attend Parliament."
"I am sure that by this you also mean the relevant committees, to wit the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"We would be highly delighted if there could be a form of cooperation with you which, although institutionally different, is on the same basis as that with the Commission, which has stated that it will attend Parliament and the committees whenever it is asked to by the Parliament."
"If you consider this to be necessary, then I believe we shall make good progress together."
"I would like to say a word of thank you to the other Group chairpersons who agreed last Thursday that the European Commission, represented here by Chris Patten, should be allowed to speak today."
"Under Article 18 of the EU Treaty, the European Commission must participate fully in the Common Foreign and Security Policy and for this reason our Group will always defend the interests of the Commission, which are also the interests of the European Union, and will always require that you work together prominently in the interest of Europe, as I think is wonderfully ensured by both individuals in question."
"There is no place for competition and mutual ambition; rather, we must work towards the common goal of a strong and competent Europe."
"With you as the Secretary-General of the West European Union and the West European Union integrated into the European Union, parliamentary supervision naturally takes on a new duty and, together with the national parliaments, which will retain a supervisory function, it is the European Parliament which must carry out this supervisory function."
"We therefore believe that the Assembly of the West European Union, which has played an important role in the past, must transfer these duties to the directly elected European Parliament."
"You mentioned some of the areas in which the European Union must operate, including Russia."
"The security of our continent will depend on how things unfold in Russia."
"We want a competent, democratic Russia, but we also believe that what is happening today in Chechnya is a disgrace for Russia and a disgrace for Europe."
"By its actions in Chechnya, in Grozny and other towns, and in the countryside of Chechnya, Russia is distancing itself from the values of Europe and I would urge you, Mr Solana, and Chris Patten, to make your voice heard today, tomorrow and in the coming days at the OSCE meeting in Istanbul."
"We must not remain silent!"
"Anyone who keeps silent now and fails to make his voice heard is answerable to men, to the Muslims of Chechnya."
"(Applause)Allow me to make a final comment on security and defence policy."
"We wish to have a European defence identity, but this must not mean that we uncouple ourselves from the USA."
"Rather, we must understand it as a distribution of duties and not as duplicity."
"We must ourselves be competent and, therefore, create the necessary preconditions in terms of transport, communication, news-gathering and modern satellites."
"We cannot simply leave everything to the Americans."
"It is also a matter of technology, as Chris Patten rightly said."
"This must not take place in opposition to America, but additionally."
"I think that if, as Europeans, we do our duty in this matter, we will generally strengthen the North Atlantic alliance and if, as Mr Solana and Mr Patten have said, we carry out these duties and you, Mr Solana, as the Commission does, undertake to seek dialogue with us whenever we consider it necessary, then my group will support you."
"In this regard I wish you every success in your work."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Secretary of the Council and High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Commissioner, firstly I would like to welcome the appearance of Mr Solana, in his three-fold capacity as Secretary-General of the Council, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary-General of the WEU, currently in pectore."
"I imagine that in terms of the Community budget, they will be three jobs for one salary."
"I wish you luck."
"I am not going to sing the praises of Javier Solana."
"We have shared a great friendship and many years of struggle, first for the freedom of my country and then for our integration into Europe."
"And I expect that the defence of democratic values which he displayed in earlier incarnations will accompany him and inspire him in his new task."
"For the first time the Council has a human face - and I hope this is permanent - and I am sure that Mr Solana will be able to confront this challenge, which I believe is important not only for the Council, but also for the development of the European Union as a whole."
"Since much has been said about his duty as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, I would like to mention an aspect which I consider to be important: our Common Foreign and Security Policy will be, fundamentally, a reflection and extension of our internal strength."
"Our ability to create a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and also a defence policy, will depend on how united we are on the consolidation of our strength."
"This means that Mr Solana will not only have to deal with the more immediate question of crisis prevention, but also - and he has some experience in this - that of our role in the world, that is to say, the United Nations, the Millennium Round and the future of the IMF and the FAO; it is also important in the sense that Europeans, in constructing Europe, are also doing something important for the future and stability of humanity."
"I believe that this consideration must inspire his activities and, at the same time, as Secretary of the Council, I hope it will allow him to help in the task of reforming and giving coherence to that institution which, at the moment, is perhaps the institution which most requires the impetus of rationalisation."
"Mr Solana has spoken at length on the security and defence question."
"I believe that he is the person who has shown himself, in this historic process, to be the most capable of seeing through the complex evolution which involves the development of a European identity in terms of defence, in which NATO itself and our North American partners are coming to accept the need for a strong European pillar, not only in the field of defence, but also in terms of the industrial dimension which must support it and also in the role of stabilising and consolidating democracy in Europe and the Mediterranean."
"To this end, I believe that he will have a decisive role to play at the upcoming OSCE meeting as regards the crisis in Chechnya."
"My colleagues will comment on these issues later."
"I would like to conclude my remarks by speaking of the need for close cooperation with the Commission - and I am not asking Mr Patten to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr Solana."
"We simply need them to understand each other perfectly."
"And with regard to the role of this Parliament, I believe that in recent years we have shown our capacity to help and collaborate and I understand that, from the point of view of the form that the dimension and development of the Union' s defence and security policy can and must take, we can play an important role in relation to the rest of the world."
"I believe that, on this occasion, we must offer our cooperation and show the most positive of attitudes."
"Madam President, I believe, as the other speakers have said, that this is a significant formal occasion today, because we have for the first time in plenary the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"It has been said that he has three jobs but only one salary."
"But an even greater marvel is that he has three such great, large, heavy hats and only one head to wear them on."
"High Representative, we wish you every success in this task."
"As regards your role, we hope, above all, that you may contribute to closing the gap between the aspirations and reality of European foreign policy."
"The challenge that you undertake is at the core of what we do."
"To take an example, in 1992 we as a Union drew up the Petersberg Tasks which offered comprehensive non-military and military security options."
"The aspirations set out in those Tasks were perhaps most rudely challenged by Kosovo where the gap between aspirations and reality was cruelly exposed by an absence of an appropriate operational substance."
"The highest priority for you now is to begin to give operational content and meaning to both the non-military and military challenges of Petersberg, not least, given the several hats you wear, particularly the military ones."
"My own group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is strongly committed to the general concept of developing a capacity for autonomous European action which correctly has been identified as a rapid response capability with the necessary logistical support."
"This will perhaps require some re-allocation of resources."
"This issue of cost will have to become a parallel priority in our debates."
"We are committed to a capability for autonomous EU action in my group."
"We are somewhat sceptical about the degree to which this should be autonomous of transatlantic relations."
"In so far as you have dealt with the issue in broad transatlantic terms, my group welcomes strongly that emphasis."
"A second point I would like to raise is the question of the European Union and the coordination of our aid policies and our foreign policies."
"I should like to say to both Mr Solana and Mr Patten that there is an enormous challenge to bring greater political coherence to this task."
"The Union or its Member States account for half of all the world' s humanitarian aid and half of all international development aid."
"The Union gives three-fifths of all aid to Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States."
"But we have nothing like a proportionate say and influence in terms of foreign policy."
"This is a core challenge that we look to you and to the Commission to resolve in terms of foreign policy."
"If we develop this operational capacity through the Petersberg Tasks, if we develop more coherence in aid and foreign policy, how can we then adopt more coherent policies in international fora?"
"We have a great density of institutional relations - we have touched on some of them in the debate already."
"In particular, I want to signal on behalf of my group an interest in the non-debate that waxes and wanes every so often about the reform of the UN Security Council."
"Without prejudice to the arrangements in existing Member States, it is a question that we must look at in due course."
"If we are really to have a non-military as well as military capacity, an effective voice at the Security Council table would be important especially in our outreach beyond Europe itself."
"This is therefore something we would put down as a marker."
"In his hearing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Solana talked about having a less declaratory and more active foreign policy."
"We agree whole-heartedly with that, and I would say one of the tests that we would have in the back of our minds as a group is this: in five years' time will we have exported stability to south-eastern Europe, or will we still be importing the consequences of instability?"
"This is for us a core challenge."
"Today is the tenth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia as it then was."
"I hope, Mr Solana, that you will use your role to give an added sense of political urgency to the task of enlargement, rather than to promote procrastination."
"I hope that you will use your voice to teach the lessons to be learned from the former Yugoslavia."
"It is an ambitious, difficult task."
"We wish you well."
"You will have the full support and goodwill of my group."
"Madam President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I believe the crisis in Kosovo showed, among other things, that international crisis management cannot be left to NATO alone in the world of the twenty-first century."
"In fact, the leading role played by the United States is not as unproblematic as some might think."
"It was found in Kosovo that military personnel can sometimes be wiser and more realistic than politicians, so we need not necessarily fear military personnel."
"On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I would say that the majority of our Group seem to have come to accept that the European Union could develop common crisis management strategies but we want to impose clear conditions and frameworks for this."
"Firstly, foreign policy must be consistent; its different aspects must form a coherent whole that leads us in the same, and not different, directions."
"Foreign policy must also be open."
"Mr Solana, I have to mention that I have personally fought against the Security Council, of which you are leader, in court for more than two years, using non-military means, to obtain a certain document which concerns compliance on the part of Member States with criteria relating to the export of weapons."
"I hope that you will increase transparency in the work of the Council in foreign policy also."
"Another condition that is very important is that the management of civil crises must be improved markedly."
"What you said is quite right: progress has been made in this area during the Finnish Presidency."
"Keep the two operations together."
"It is not necessarily a good thing to divide the tasks, with the High Representative taking responsibility for military crisis management and the member of the Commission for civil crisis management."
"They have to be kept together."
"Thirdly, we want to lay down the condition that each operation must be independent from the others, and decisions on it must be able to be taken separately."
"The Member States must be able to decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether they should become involved in these operations."
"The criteria must naturally be the same for all."
"We cannot accept a situation where different criteria have been applied in Kosovo and in Chechnya, for example."
"Finally, the main question here is how relations between the European Union and NATO will develop."
"Eleven of the present Member States belong to NATO, but four do not."
"We have to avoid a situation where the European Union is becoming an actual pillar of NATO in Europe."
"It is important that NATO and the European Union remain, in reality, distinct from one another."
"Such an asymmetric structure can help promote peace in the world."
"It does not imply weakness; it may also be a resource."
"Madam President, Mr Solana, I opposed the action of the Secretary-General of NATO."
"I welcome Mr CFSP' s taking office."
"In fulfilling your new role, you will find my group a demanding partner, extremely critical, if necessary, but deeply convinced that the European Union must be represented to a much greater extent, more active and more proactive, in the international arena."
"Wherever you go in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Asia, everywhere you can gauge the degree of expectation there is for a major ally, which is capable and resolved to assist them in extricating themselves from the demanding showdown against America which is arrogant and too powerful."
"What splendid challenges you could devote yourself to accepting on behalf of the Fifteen: establishing yourself as a protagonist in your own right in the Near East in order to contribute towards establishing a just and lasting peace, as now seems possible; launching the Lomé negotiations once again on new bases, integrating the concerns of our 71 partners in the south, in order to safeguard the spirit of this Convention which is unique in the world; addressing international financial institutions with an alternative opinion, for example, in favour of cancelling the debt of those countries which are today arrested in their development because of this infernal mechanism; starting a real international crusade in favour of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, at this time when there is great danger once again of proliferation; establishing yourself as the spokesperson, the standard-bearer for the enhancement of the United Nations' system again, ensuring that the UN Charter is respected, promoting a form of civilised international relations, forever doing away with war as the means of settling disputes, and, in the short term, if you please, putting an end to the intolerable inertia of the Union as regards the savage war in Chechnya by some means other than a few purely formal communiqués."
"Finally, I invite you, High Representative, to make a courageous and critical assessment of the war in the Balkans."
"In Kosovo, we face a serious policy failure, as one form of nationalism succeeds another, as one form of ethnic cleansing succeeds another, this time with the Union, the UN and NATO in attendance."
"In the rest of Yugoslavia, an Iraq-style scenario is in progress."
"The power, which is legitimately censured, is still firmly in place, while the population, which is unfairly penalised, is enduring a martyrdom which is morally unacceptable and politically dangerous."
"As for the region, it is anything but stabilised."
"These realities cannot fail to be of direct concern to you."
"So, do not take as the only lesson to be drawn from this terrible experience the need to be able to line up more troops, to increase military expenditure and to advance at the double towards the Europe of Defence within, what is more, the framework of NATO."
"I am not seeking to draw a veil over the military aspect of security, but the key factor, in my opinion, is that this strategy continues to be obsessed by military matters, at the expense of a major pan-European policy for the prevention of conflict capable of dealing with the tensions and splits of the post-Cold War period on this continent."
"To give just one illustration of this imbalance: tomorrow, as you very briefly mentioned, fifty European Heads of State are to meet in Istanbul at the OSCE Summit dedicated to drawing up a security charter for the twenty-first century."
"But how many people know about this?"
"How many people are talking about this?"
"The Council representative did not even consider the request I made for a debate in the European Parliament prior to this conference to be appropriate."
"Revitalising the OSCE, re-establishing it, making its debates open to the public of European society, that is one more grand design, which is, in my opinion, inseparable from the prospect of enlargement of the Union."
"This is the constructive message that I wished to convey to you today on behalf of my group."
"Mr Solana, you specifically referred to your recent meetings in Pristina as well as some suitable general points regarding the future Balkan Stability Pact and the future multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo."
"I should have liked to hear you give a more explicit account, Mr Solana, of the heart of this key matter, telling us how, within the CFSP, you intend to contribute to correcting, inasmuch as it is still possible, the most disastrous consequences for this continent of the actions which you at least paid for in Yugoslavia, if you did not order them, in your capacity as Secretary-General of NATO, and which we must confront today."
"How specifically do you plan to contribute towards assisting the civilian population, in a European country whose infrastructure we have destroyed, in getting through the ordeal of a winter which promises to be dreadful for them?"
"How do you plan, if there were still time for this, to contribute towards curbing the total exodus of Serbs from Kosovo, or to promoting their return?"
"It would indeed be iniquitous to be turning the prayer wheels for a multi-ethnic Kosovo if we are in fact letting it become mono-ethnic."
"How do you plan to contribute towards preventing the Federation of Yugoslavia being completely dismembered at a time when there is increasing pressure in favour of Kosovan independence following NATO' s intervention?"
"In brief, High Representative, how do you plan to ensure that the CFSP contributes towards a situation where the actual consequences of NATO intervention are not the exact opposite of the objectives assigned to it, to wit, a Yugoslavia which is dismembered and ruined, and which is still governed by Mr Milosevic, and a Kosovo which is extremist, mono-ethnic and independent?"
"The EU' s combined defence chief and foreign minister, Mr Solana, said very clearly and plainly that Monday' s meeting in Brussels was historic, for - as the representative said - the EU is taking up its rightful place on the world stage."
"In other words, the EU is to be equipped with a military capacity and to become a superpower."
"This is plain talking compared to what the press and what government offices are saying, especially in the non-aligned countries which are Members of the European Union."
"But is it a military superpower that the peoples of Europe need?"
"Both Mr Solana and Mr Patten, and most of the speakers, have revealed a sort of surrealistic Dr Strangelove-style logic surrounding this whole problem area, a logic which goes like this: shoot first and ask questions later."
"The trial run for the so-called peacemaking measures, which is of course one of those splendidly misleading euphemisms, may be seen in the Kosovo crisis and in the attack on Kosovo this spring."
"This is assumed to have been a success which has shown that NATO has a role which the EU should now take over because we can do so more cheaply and more efficiently than the Americans whom, moreover, we are supposed to follow through thick and thin."
"It was not a success."
"It was a disaster in every way."
"Several of the speakers, among them Mr Souchet, have touched on this point."
"In fact, something like the opposite of what was intended has been achieved."
"People have a distorted and hypocritical stance on the question of Kosovo' s constitutional status and status in international law, and the action in Kosovo shows first and foremost that the small nations have been made to join forces with the Allies."
"Their influence has been confined to that of being able to confirm decisions already taken by the large countries."
"It has been, in every respect, a total fiasco. In fact, it has been more than that: it has been a disaster."
"It is high time that the European peace movements were revitalised as a counterweight to the foolish militarisation that has been taking place in recent years, for which there is not much support to be found in this Chamber."
"Mr Alavanos, I shall give you a reply straight away."
"As Mr Solana has just said, he must take his leave in order to attend the OSCE Summit."
"I can, however, assure you that Mr Sasi will be present at the Question Time to the Council and I can guarantee that he is perfectly competent to do so."
"Madam President, the new political-military apparatus which Mr Solana is hoping and praying for is nothing but a watered down version of the European Defence Community which France discarded in 1954 in a far more threatening international context."
"Now that the Soviet Union has disappeared and danger, less clear-cut but just as formidable, today threatens from the south, the rivalries between the major Western powers have become more pronounced."
"Germany, rather like France in the 1960s, hopes to find in political Europe not only the opportunity to regain lost credibility but also the opportunity to find veiled resources of power politics."
"The real issue which is hidden behind the Europe of defence is actually access to nuclear weapons or, failing this, the removal in the long term of the French nuclear deterrent which, as everyone knows, exists when it is not shared."
"Although the United States did not seek the French supremacy to which it adapted extremely well, as Dr Kissinger wrote on several occasions, it would then adapt to the new situation by distancing itself from European affairs."
"So, the on-going interest in short-term results at the expense of the long term, a certain French President' s need for personal glorification, a score of zero, and all these discussions and other protocols of Nuremberg are in danger of upsetting the subtle geopolitical balance of power which has existed for decades between the United States, France, Great Britain and Germany."
"This tendency must be fought with all the necessary strength, particularly by the strict application of the rule of unanimity, without a legal get-out or differentiated cooperation."
"Before giving the floor to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, I would like to make an announcement on a question I was asked regarding the Napolitano report."
"For the time being we have the translation in five languages, but we have every hope of having the report in all the official languages by noon, which means we could set the deadline for the submission of amendments at 8 p.m. today."
"The text of the amendments would therefore be available tomorrow morning at 9 a.m."
"Madam President, this morning you guaranteed us 24 hours for the submission of amendments."
"In that case, we will have to bring the deadline forward to before 8 p.m. in order to have 24 hours before the time of the vote, at noon."
"If you would rather, we can try to organise things in this way."
"At the moment we are waiting for the report to be available in all languages."
"I think that is the first matter to deal with."
"At present only some of the languages are available."
"Madam President, I am sorry but the period of 24 hours starts from the time when the Members have the document in their own language, in this case at noon today."
"The time limit for amendments would then be set at noon tomorrow, if I understand correctly."
"You shall have your 24-hour period."
"We shall see how we may proceed."
"I am sorry but I really do not see how you can, Madam President."
"Madam President, I would also like to wish Mr Solana every success in this difficult task of creating a Common Foreign and Security Policy which is effective, visible and coherent."
"I had the opportunity to question him on this subject during his appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, as to what the political means would be - and I was thinking fundamentally of the Intergovernmental Conference - to make use of the next Intergovernmental Conference to the benefit of the CFSP."
"At that time, Mr Solana told me that he had not yet finished considering the issue and I would like to know whether he has made any progress in this respect."
"I would like to know, Mr Solana, what the political, economic and budgetary means are - bearing in mind the principle that ""he who pays is in charge"" , which you know very well from your time as Secretary-General of NATO - to create a force which can maintain peace and prevent situations as dramatic as those which we have seen recently in the Balkans."
"You have also spoken this morning of the problem of human rights."
"In this respect, I would like to know your opinion with regard to relations between the European Union and China, especially in light of the recent trade agreement between that country and the United States."
"And on the subject of the United States, I would like to ask you two very specific questions."
"Firstly: What is your opinion of President Clinton' s statement that Turkey should become a Member of the European Union?"
"And secondly: What do you think about the pressure which the United States administration is putting on some European companies - I am referring to the Spanish Sol Meliá chain and other companies such as the Club Méditérranée and the German company LTU - and what measures, in your opinion, should the European Union take?"
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to ask the High Representative, with regard to our policy and relations regarding Latin America, if you think that the new European Union priorities which have resulted from the Rio Summit would require new resources."
"I understand that your answer is yes and therefore: What do you feel about the decision of the Council of Ministers which, on the first reading of next year' s budget, has reduced the amounts to a level lower than the amounts for 1996?"
"What will you say in this respect to the Mercosur Ministers with whom I believe you are going to meet next week?"
"Do you think that the new priorities on Latin America have to be dealt with using fewer resources, in opposition to what this Parliament approved in the first reading?"
"Mr Solana, you will not be a Lord Grey in any sense; you are very welcome here."
"Mr Solana, wearing your two hats as ""Mr CFSP"" and Secretary- General of the WEU, you are going to have a great responsibility in our common endeavour to establish a European order of peace."
"First on the agenda is the matter of complying with the Cologne decisions on crisis management and conflict-prevention initiatives."
"These decisions also include the Member States' undertakings to establish a specific military capacity in such a way that the EU' s ability to take credible initiatives in accordance with the principles of the UN' s Charter is reinforced, and this without any Member State' s interests being compromised and without the EU' s taking on NATO' s basic tasks."
"Right now, a lot of energy is being spent on crisis management, something you talked a lot about."
"We are seeing more and more proposals on the way."
"Against this background, I should like to ask you the following question. You said that our citizens feel that we ought to be able to intervene in a crisis."
"Yes, but I think our citizens want us to be able to intervene before crises break out at all."
"My question is therefore as follows: do you share the view that measures to prevent conflict are at least as important as the crisis management which in fact kicks in at a stage where politics and diplomacy have failed?"
"What measures are you therefore going to take in the area of conflict prevention so that you can, as it were, start taking charge of preventing fires rather than turning out to fight them?"
"The Cologne decision ought not to lead to our one day finding ourselves in the same situation as my second home country, Switzerland, where, following studies of possible threats to the country over the next decade, the conclusion was reached that Switzerland is well equipped to deal with dangers which no longer exist."
"I would mention in this context that the Conflict Prevention Network (CPN), established by Michel Rocard on the initiative of the European Parliament, warned, long before the Kosovo conflict, that war was going to break out, and that a variety of visiting delegations from Parliament did the same thing."
"The CPN still exists, but the problem, then as now, is that there is no structure in the Commission or in the Council which can effectively utilise the experience and expertise of the CPN and others."
"Mister President, the fact that most Members of my group welcome the creation of a European defence identity has a lot - but not everything - to do with the lessons we have learnt from the Kosovo war and the insight that, unfortunately, in some cases, it is necessary to use armed force if there is a mass violation of human rights."
"Having said this, I would like to emphasise once more - this has fortunately already been done by many speakers - that, to my mind, the power of the European Union is, or should lie, in crisis management and the prevention of conflict."
"I am therefore grateful to Mr Patten who has emphatically drawn attention to this very issue."
"I think that he is right."
"I think that the power of the European Union - as already referred to by the previous speaker - lies in the fact that, before conflict spreads, every effort should be made to prevent this from happening."
"Within this context, I would again like to ask Mr Solana about his pledges in the Committee on Foreign Affairs following a feasibility study carried out by the European civil peace corps."
"He confirmed this at the time and I would like to hear from him again, as this is one of the very situations in which the European Union could be effective in the prevention of conflict."
"The question remains how autonomous this conduct of the European Union will be in future, how independent from the United States and how closely involved with Russia, for example."
"Your successor, Mr Robertson, has stated in a number of interviews that the EU' s conduct will largely remain restricted to minor, less significant conflicts."
"This remark has prompted three questions that I would like to ask here."
"The first one is: in your opinion, what bearing does this have on the deployment of nuclear weapons?"
"Would you agree with me that the EU' s involvement in smaller conflicts then renders nuclear weapons completely unusable and superfluous?"
"Secondly, you mentioned the reorganisation of funds and the making available of appropriate tools."
"Would you agree with me that, at present, the reorganisation of funds within the European Union is far more important than consideration being given to raising the ceiling on defence?"
"Thirdly, cooperation with Russia: Could you be more precise about how the European Union should bring this about, independently of NATO?"
"After all, if the majority of potential areas of conflict are either in or bordering Russia, does this not raise the dilemma of us creating something which we will only be able to use in practice with great difficulty, precisely because Russia is involved?"
"High Representative, the establishment of your post and, in particular, your appointment, have certainly created high expectations among those members of the public - and I think they are numerous - who think that Europe needs a Common Foreign and Security Policy if, as you said, it wants to be at all credible in areas other than trade or economic stature."
"It is therefore a question of high expectations and, I believe, also high hopes, especially if - as Commissioner Patten said - a synergy really will be created between the two institutions."
"Your task is certainly a very difficult one."
"I do not mean it is impossible, but a host of good wishes - which we all give you (they are free and cost absolutely nothing) - will certainly not suffice. Maybe you need something more tangible."
"The first steps, taken in the Council at least, do not seem particularly promising."
"I am referring to a fact that might be considered to be of secondary importance by many, but that I think is very significant: you thought Monday' s Council meeting a historic occasion for defence."
"Can this be true?"
"I, too, consider Monday' s Council meeting historic, but in a negative way and for other reasons. I refer to the incomprehensible attitude taken in respect of an initiative, promoted for once by the European Union, on the moratorium on capital punishment."
"If I have understood correctly, this time the Ministers have decided to be particularly thorough."
"They have decided to stand their ground and to withdraw the proposal for a moratorium, or at least to block it."
"They have decided to make a huge effort to be verbosely and verbally maximalist and extremist and are refusing to give ground or negotiate ..."
"Basically, they have decided to lose."
"This position is so astonishing that I wonder whether any of the Ministers have actually read the amendment and the facts, because this is completely incomprehensible, unless it is true, as some people suspect, that this strict, moralist position will serve to save the face of some of the great powers who are not especially interested in the proposed moratorium."
"It does not take much to realise, Commissioner, that what we should have done was to use serious negotiations to bring moderate countries which do not use capital punishment over to our side, countries which had taken positions and which were sensitive regarding the preamble - I repeat, the preamble - based on an article in the United Nations Charter."
"But why are we trying to amend the United Nations Charter, Commissioner?"
"What do we hope to gain with a proposal for a moratorium?"
"Are we trying to reform the Security Council or change the Charter?"
"None of this makes sense."
"If I may say so, what happened on Monday was disgraceful."
"As a consequence, the European Union will withdraw - so it seems - the proposal for a moratorium, or it will not even put it to the vote."
"Just think about it: a freeze on the proposal."
"And we want to talk about credibility?"
"The truth of the matter is that today, Mr Solana, Europe is very good at making empty, pompous announcements, but it is completely incapable of learning from history and seeing how and where we really can negotiate."
"So again, my heartfelt good wishes, but these in the form of a simple suggestion on the Common Foreign and Security policy: maybe using the process of economic and monetary union to reach diplomatic and military union would be a good way of transforming declarations of intent into more concrete steps."
"Mr President, Mr High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, I would also like to congratulate you very warmly on your new post as High Representative and wish you all the luck that your new post requires in order that it may be a success, both for you and, above all, for the European Union."
"And having said this in your language, I am afraid I will have to continue in German and I would ask you to put your headphones on."
"First of all, unlike many other speakers, I am not happy with the decision taken on Monday and, Mr Solana, as a former pacifist turned militarist, I would actually feel that your role within the WEU is a further compromising of neutral states."
"Now there are a significant number in my group from neutral and non-neutral countries alike who are actually very much against the whole idea of the creation of a European defence identity, and the debate within the neutral countries is being conducted in an extremely dishonest fashion."
"You yourself said that Monday was a historic occasion and that is true."
"It was a historic occasion."
"It was the first time that there was a formal meeting of defence ministers, and the decisions that were taken were historic."
"However, within the neutral states, the public is being misled."
"In fact, it is being brushed over as a non-event."
"For example, our Foreign Minister said that he was quite happy with the decisions taken: he said that the interests of neutral countries were taken on board and that they were met within the opinion which was submitted by the EU Political Committee."
"In that opinion, it states that your role will be confined to what is set out in the Treaty on the European Union and also on the decisions taken at the European Council meeting in Cologne."
"That actually is quite a broad perspective and anything can happen within that."
"Within the Western European Union the issue of the mutual defence guarantee is even stronger than within NATO; within the neutral countries the general opinion at the moment is that the mutual defence commitment does not apply."
"But, I believe and many people within the neutral countries believe that when further decisions are taken, eventually the mutual defence commitment will be applied."
"I also believe that, as Commissioner Patten mentioned, this involves basically the whole issue of a European arms industry."
"His statement gives credence to our fears about the creation of a European arms industry."
"The St Malo Summit concluded that the EU needed, and I quote, 'strengthened armed forces that can react rapidly to the new risks and which are supported by a strong and competitive European defence industry and technology' ."
"There are many Member States within the European Union which are not involved in the arms industry and do not want to be involved in the arms industry."
"These decisions and discussions are not taking place at an honest level within the Member States, and especially within the neutral countries: the public is being misled."
"Here, in this Parliament today, it was quite clear and most people were quite honest about it: they want a European defence identity, they want a competitive European arms industry and they want a European army; but the public in the Member States has not actually been consulted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint appearance here of both Javier Solana and Chris Patten is symbolic since they will enjoy joint success or, if they do not work together, joint failure."
"It is in our common interest that they succeed as this will also be our success and in this we must support them."
"It is also an indication that the new troika is finally starting to work."
"If I have understood things correctly, the Finnish Council Presidency has again sent the old troika to Russia."
"The new troika to which you both belong should also, in future, take on representation abroad."
"Since 1990 and the collapse of bloc confrontation, it has once again become possible to carry out conventional wars at regional level in Europe, which in turn facilitate the old classic struggle between ethnic groups, border disputes and the like, the old circle of violence."
"We Europeans have not yet found an answer to this, as the former Yugoslavia shows."
"The efforts which are now being made in the common security and defence initiative are an attempt to find the European answer, specifically in terms of prevention."
"However, prevention, Mr Sakellariou, only works if it is backed by a credible military force."
"For this reason, the two must be tied together."
"Only then can prevention be genuinely implemented and I hope that it will work accordingly."
"I think that, through joint efforts, it will be possible to achieve synergetic effects in gathering troops to combat crises with the aim of bringing about a common armaments agency."
"We all know about the meagreness of the budgets and I think that with these synergetic effects the aim can be achieved."
"We should not do this with independent expensive structures but, as far as possible, in accordance with the NATO Resolution adopted at Berlin in 1996, in tandem with NATO and with the NATO structures."
"This seems to me to be an important route because it strengthens transatlantic ties whilst at the same time creating our own European capability where it is needed."
"In my estimation, this would also mean that we will be able to carry out our duties jointly or separately, but not against our traditional partners."
"The European Union, with its common currency, common internal market and common legal system, has a common interest in also implementing a credible common security and defence policy."
"However, we must also realise that this picture cannot exist indefinitely in areas where there are varying degrees of security."
"For this reason, at the Intergovernmental Conference, we should seek to make article 5 of the WEU Treaty a protocol of the EU Treaty to which each state can accede and, specifically, on the basis of an independent sovereign resolution."
"This means that none of the neutral or non-allied states would be compelled to accede."
"However, everything would then fall under the umbrella of credibility and common interests and we could further develop matters on this basis such that the appointment of Mr Solana as Secretary-General of the West European Union and the involvement of that Union could be fully effected without us needing to make allowance for article 5."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, it is with very great pleasure that I can welcome you here in your new role, and I am delighted that in a few days you will be combining this role with that of Secretary-General of the WEU."
"This all augurs well, and represents real progress."
"An equally good augury is given by the desire for mutual cooperation expressed by yourself and by Mr Patten, who has also just made some very rational statements."
"Let me address you in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, regarding security and defence policy."
"This means I have listened to you with the utmost concentration."
"In brief, today, permit me to stress the timetable or, to be more specific, the rate of the innovations and reforms which you are responsible for."
"The Kosovo crisis has made Europeans aware of the gaps in the political and military resources available to them."
"Furthermore, they have become more than ever aware of the risks they are running in letting a system continue which was designed at the time of the Cold War and which is no longer in any way suitable for the instances of instability which are proliferating around Europe and even within Europe."
"This increased awareness provides an opportunity for innovation, as the Cologne Summit showed."
"But I am afraid that this window of opportunity may close again all too soon under the pressure of national conservatism and budgetary constraints."
"This is why my view is that things must get done quickly, as quickly as possible."
"Institutional reforms still need careful consideration, of course."
"It would be a mistake to rush."
"The same goes for the fundamental question of the respective roles of Europe and the United States."
"The solutions are not yet fully mature, but there are certainly already some practical steps which can be taken quickly."
"For example, the enlargement of the General Affairs Council to include Defence Ministers, a formula which was already tested last Monday; setting up a permanent political body, ""COPS"" , responsible for monitoring all matters relating to common foreign and security policy, including defence; setting up a Military Committee; creating a rapid deployment task force of approximately 50,000 men, and so on and so forth. And I should take care not to forget the task which the Finnish Presidency, quite rightly, considered to be of great significance: improving our non-military security resources, particularly for preventive purposes."
"All this may be achieved quickly on the lines of the guidelines established by the Fifteen."
"I think the old adage of testing the ground by walking on it would be particularly wise in this case, Mr Solana."
"The uncoordinated and therefore ineffective response of the EU to the crises in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo was a serious embarrassment."
"Thankfully, it would now seem that we are learning our lessons."
"This week' s discussions at the General Affairs Council are to be warmly welcomed."
"The intention to place the reinforcement of European security and defence policy high on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council is an appropriate one."
"The positive approach of a traditionally neutral country such as Austria to these developments is to be applauded and I urge all other neutral Member States, including my own, to follow their lead."
"Needless to say, I disagree with my Irish colleague, Mrs McKenna, because I believe that the establishment of an EU defence policy is as much an essential prerequisite of genuine European integration as the single currency."
"If you subscribe to one, you should support the other."
"Allied to these exciting developments is the emergence of a Franco-British proposal to establish a force of 40,000 by 2003 to cover all Petersberg Tasks on a permanent basis."
"Before I welcome this proposal, I wish to see removed the ambiguity that has arisen in the wake of the remarks made by the British Defence Secretary, Geoffrey Hoon, namely is it a Franco-British force or an EU force?"
"If the EU is to act as one in the future then the force must be an EU one with components from all Member States who wish to participate, and operating on the initiative and under the political control of the EU."
"I look forward to the Helsinki Council endorsing this vital principle and other elements which will strengthen the EU' s security and defence role."
"Mr President, may I start by paying Mr Solana a huge compliment?"
"Since he has taken office, the second pillar has been a hive of activity."
"The agenda is enormous."
"In actual fact, all EU political issues are dominated by foreign affairs and the Finnish Presidency is certainly taking great strides forwards."
"This is, in fact, worth two compliments if one considers the country' s historical neutrality."
"I would like to discuss European security policy and put a number of issues before Mr Solana, a number of questions which he may not be able to deal with today but which should be given priority in future, to my mind."
"First of all, I back the EU' s ambitions in this field."
"The European security and defence identity should and shall emerge."
"I will not enlarge upon the military aspect, the structure and the capacity required, but I would like to be informed of the extent of the so-called Petersberg Tasks because the answer to this question will determine a great deal."
"Does the Union focus on minor or major crises?"
"And if it focuses on minor crisis situations, what happens if a minor crisis escalates into a major one - because we all know that this is not unusual."
"According to the Washington Declaration, the European security and defence identity is open to all NATO countries."
"How does this relate to the EU' s ambition to be able to take unilateral decisions?"
"What is to be done about the NATO countries which are not within the EU, namely Norway, Turkey and the three countries in Central and Eastern Europe?"
"Many would like to know what will happen after your appointment as Secretary-General of the Western European Union."
"How can the WEU be fully integrated into the EU and what will then happen with the infamous article 5?"
"Although some people in the Netherlands would like to take over the British role when it comes to desperately hanging on to the Atlantic relationship, and I mean the former British role, this is surely not comparable with the issues at large in neutral, non-aligned EU Member States regarding the European security and defence identity."
"I can respect this opinion."
"But how can such respect be compatible with a progressive agenda when it comes to the European security and defence identity?"
"I know from my own experience that a broader approach to security and making conflict prevention a priority can be helpful here."
"The Union could make headway on this score by improving coordination between the first and second pillars."
"I would like to finish off with a pertinent question."
"I think that we all, but also you, the Council and the Commission, should be concerned about how Parliament can monitor the system which we are developing."
"I would like to discuss within Parliament, but also with you, the way in which we could, from within this Parliament, but also from within national parliaments, better monitor the coming into being of the European security and defence identity and the further elaboration thereof."
"First of all let me thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for their statements."
"It seems to me that in all this discussion of European security, two elements - defence capabilities and institutional arrangements - have been confused and one seems hostage to the other."
"Of course we welcome any commitments by European states to modernise their armed forces in order to redress the present well-known deficiencies."
"As Mr Solana knows from his previous appointment, many Allied states do not even fulfil their force commitments to NATO."
"These issues are already being addressed by the Alliance as part of the defence capabilities initiative."
"The British armed forces are world class but they have been desperately over-stretched over the past year."
"I am not sure from where, therefore, the UK Government intends to find and sustain its contribution to some new European rapid deployment force that it has proposed, unless this is just smoke and mirrors, or at the expense of commitments to NATO."
"I have to say that legitimate concerns about military capabilities are not resolved by the Europeanisation of defence, which responds to an essentially political agenda and is an aspect of the process of European political integration."
"The danger is that there will be pressure for the EU to become the organisation of first resort when next there is a crisis to be dealt with and that NATO would increasingly be relegated to a purely residual role as a collective defence organisation."
"NATO' s vitality and transatlantic solidarity will only be maintained if NATO remains closely and constantly engaged in current crisis management."
"Of course, as the Europeans are not proposing any additional forces, the capacity for EU autonomous action refers primarily to the political decision-making process."
"The key issue will be the interaction between the two centres of decision making, NATO and the EU, and the impact of this on the transatlantic relationship."
"Can we really afford strategically or financially duplicated staffs and committees, the proliferation of Euro forces and the wastefulness and confusion of subjecting our armed forces to two separate operational doctrines and planning regimes?"
"Encumbering the European Union with defence responsibilities will do little to encourage it to make more effective use of its valuable non-military crisis-management instruments, which could genuinely complement the military forces of NATO."
"This is where the EU' s emphasis should be as Mr Patten has indicated."
"Improved military capabilities within the well-tried structures of NATO, not institutional geometry in Euro headquarters, are what is needed."
"The requirement, the objective is for greater security effectiveness with the Europeans and North Americans each contributing more proportionately."
"Our armies should not be recruited to the process of political integration, dressed up in other clothes."
"Kosovo showed us four things above all else."
"Firstly, that the European Union is capable of maintaining a common front during a crisis."
"Secondly, the excellent work of President Artisari shows that the EU can take decisive diplomatic action."
"Thirdly, it also shows us that NATO works well, and indeed works best, when the United States is focused and gives clear leadership."
"But also it shows that when that leadership is absent Europe has to be able to have the capacity to act to preserve the security of its own continent."
"And, fourthly, it showed us that, despite the fact that we spend 70% of what the Americans spend on defence, we are almost entirely dependent on American equipment because we have something like 10% of their capacity."
"And part of that reason of course is that much of our military is based on the cold war principles of static defence and not the modern principles of rapid reaction."
"Unless we address that question then the whole issue of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and a European defence identity is no more than a day-dream."
"So, I welcome what has been said today, but I do have some questions and, unusually for these sorts of debates, I would actually like some answers."
"Does Mr Solana agree with me that what we need primarily is a European defence review to assess our capacities?"
"Does he agree with me that conscription is incompatible with a modern mobile force?"
"Does he agree with me that we need to have a Council of Defence Ministers if we are to address these questions?"
"And does he agree with me that we need to have convergence of defence expenditure by Member States?"
"He also addressed the question of non-EU NATO members."
"Is he saying, as I think he is, that Turkey is vital to the success of the European defence initiative and we should take that into account?"
"And to Mr Patten may I say I welcome what he said about armaments but will the Commission be following up its previous communications with decisive action in this field and does he agree with me that the Meteor Missile project is crucial to the future of a European defence industry?"
"I am sure Mr Solana will agree with me when I say that the current goals of those of us who have a greater or lesser responsibility with regard to the process of European integration far outweigh the most optimistic ambitions of the European leaders at the time, for example, when you presided over the General Affairs Council of the European Community."
"And within this framework you have taken on the important task of personifying the joint effort to put in place a foreign and security policy which concerns us all."
"As you reminded us the other day in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, you are at the other end of that telephone which Kissinger spoke of."
"And please be assured that, in your task, you can count on the stimulus and support of this House and my group in particular."
"I am convinced that you will not disappoint us."
"Since I am confident that you will make every effort to ensure that our foreign policy will respond to balanced criteria, which will, without doubt, confirm that you give priority to the political and economic convergence of all those countries which, like Spain, almost 25 years ago, are moving from an autocratic regime to a liberal regime and that you will ensure that peace will always reign on European soil. I am also sure that you will guarantee our prominent role throughout the Mediterranean region, another priority both in economic and in security terms, and that we will effectively safeguard our interests in Latin America, for example by ensuring compliance with the commitment made with the United States Government with regard to the application of the Helms-Burton law."
"I am surprised that Mr Solana did not mention it this morning, although I have no doubt whatsoever concerning his convictions in that regard."
"In any event, we wish him every success in his work."
"Mr Solana, we have recently witnessed a meeting between Castro and the Spanish leadership and we are all aware of the position of the United States of America."
"I would also conjecture that a leader of a European country went to Belgrade to see Milosevic."
"What would your comments be on these two events?"
"I am raising this issue not to make things difficult for you, because we do not carry out foreign policy based on conjecture, but to illustrate the context in which you should operate."
"You must not walk on a tightrope because, as we all know, tightrope-walkers are doomed to fall one day."
"There are two strategies before us."
"The first is for preventing tension and the second is for managing tension and crises whenever they arise."
"The latter involves a Europe which is politically absent but economically present; it is a strategy for simply monitoring crises, which leads nowhere."
"The former is a strategy for Europe and for peace, security and economic development."
"Fifty years on, we once again witnessed war on Europe' s doorstep with the recent crisis in Yugoslavia."
"It was a mistake with indeterminable repercussions."
"Now we are confronted with a new phase of developments and hostilities in the Caucasus region."
"I believe that there is a golden opportunity for you now in the Caucasus to prove yourself as a true Prometheus and not an Epimetheus."
"You are probably familiar with the Ancient Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and the story ""Prometheus Bound"" which took place in the Caucasus region where Zeus punished Prometheus and tied him up in chains as punishment for stealing fire from the thunderbolt and giving it to Man."
"I hope, Mr Solana, that you will, in any case, be a Prometheus, both in the Caucasus and in your forthcoming term of office, as that will serve the interests of Europe, of democracy and of human rights."
"Once again, I wish you every success."
"Mr President, in the little time that remains I will try to deal with two or three issues of a general nature concerning the questions and matters which you have raised during this sitting."
"But please allow me first of all to thank all those Members of the various parliamentary groups who have chosen to speak and have wished me, and wished us, luck in this enterprise."
"I can tell you that I will put all my commitment, all my energy and all my political experience into making a great success of this enterprise, in cooperation with all the other institutions."
"I believe that, as some speakers have expressed so clearly, the Europe that is moving into the 21st century is much better than the Europe that many of us dreamt of and it still perhaps has a journey to make for those of us who are dreamers."
"We are without doubt succeeding with the common currency, we have made progress in the economic field and the moment has come to make progress in the political field, and specifically in the field of foreign and security policy."
"And in this direction and in this effort you will find that I am working with you."
"I would like to make three points in an attempt to deal collectively with the many questions you have put to me: firstly, foreign policy in the strict sense."
"After the Cologne Summit, we now have new instruments - one relates to common strategies - which must, without any doubt whatsoever, lead to a profound change in the way we approach foreign policy."
"Common strategies - some of which are already defined - must mean the pooling of all the Union' s and the Member States' capacities in order to implement a policy."
"This has not happened before now."
"This has come about as a result of the decisions taken in Cologne and, specifically, it has happened in the common strategy with regard to Russia."
"That must be our centre of gravity in terms of action."
"The second question I wanted to refer to - because many of you have raised this concern - is the concern regarding the management and prevention of crises."
"I would like to say that I agree totally - and this was best expressed in the clear intervention by Mr Pierre Schori - that we do not only have to put an end to crises, but we should prevent them from the outset."
"That is what we are trying to do."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an early warning unit whose objective is to be attentive to what may happen so that we can prevent it happening and not have to act either militarily nor collectively if we are able to do everything possible by diplomatic means or by preventive means."
"Please allow me to share with you a very sad personal experience of mine."
"When we began to take action on the Bosnia crisis we developed a military plan involving the deployment of troops - remember that 60,000 troops were deployed in Bosnia - which came a long time before the civil plan which we should have implemented."
"That difference in momentum between the two plans had consequences which many of us regret to this day and which I personally regret."
"I would like, in line with what we have noted, any crisis management or peace-keeping operation to be planned according to a global view of its civil, police and military aspects."
"In this way we would be in a better situation in Kosovo now and, before that, in Bosnia."
"And finally I would like to make a brief comment on the current issue which has been addressed - and I imagine this will be of interest to you."
"This afternoon or tomorrow morning an important meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe begins."
"The honourable representative of the left group said that the OSCE must continue to be at the heart of pan-European security."
"And he also said this in relation to the crisis in Chechnya."
"In the hours to come we have a wonderful opportunity to try to make the OSCE into an important organisation and, at the same time, to persuade the Russian authorities to allow Europe to play a role which, up till now, it has not been allowed to play."
"There is a degree of contradiction on the part of the Russian authorities who show the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe the greatest affection - so to speak - and at the same time do not allow it to play its rightful role."
"I can tell you that, on the part of the European Union, tomorrow and the day after, we will do everything possible to enable the OSCE to play an important role, in accordance with its obligations, at a time when a new charter on security in Europe is about to be signed."
"It would be really absurd if, just as we are about to sign a new collective charter on security in Europe through the OSCE, that organisation is not able to do what it has to do in the conflict which is now taking place in the Caucasus."
"There have been a good number of questions and it would take too long to answer them all one by one."
"I can tell you that I have taken note of all of them, that I will answer all of them promptly, and that, as I said at the beginning, I will be available to you at all times to try to realise our common dream."
"Thank you for your support and your cooperation."
"We will be in contact over the coming months and years to enable us to make a success of this noble endeavour which we are all taking on with great enthusiasm."
"Thank you very much, Mr Solana."
"The debate is closed."
"WTO Millennium Round"
"The next item is the report (A5-0062/1999) by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The EU Approach to the WTO Millennium Round (COM(1999) 331 - C5-0155/1999 - 1999/2149(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the EU approach to the WTO Millennium Round is in line with the work of the previous Committee on External Economic Relations which adopted its position on each of the negotiating rounds in Marrakech, Singapore and Geneva with a large majority."
"The constant dialogue with the previous Commissioner, Sir Léon Britain, in 1998 and at the beginning of 1999 also contributed to many of the ideas of the European Parliament being incorporated in the Commission' s communication of 14.7.1999 and to these ideas being fully taken up in terms of content."
"The main concern in all this was always free and fair world trade in the interest of the European economy and those employed in it."
"We are therefore keeping to the tradition of our earlier work."
"At this point I would like to thank the current Commissioner, Mr Lamy, for his outstanding cooperation with the European Parliament during the last two months."
"Since the new Commission began its work, we have been engaged in intensive and, I consider, thus far highly successful dialogue."
"Today is about clarifying the comprehensive global negotiating approach from the perspective of the European Union, weighing it up and placing it in the political context of an overall strategy."
"The entire Millennium Round should be accompanied by recommendations of a specific nature which, formulated in accordance with Rule 97 paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, give us the opportunity to influence the work of the Millennium Round before the new Agreement is concluded, to play our part and to bring our weight to bear accordingly."
"A first series of recommendations could be made at the beginning of the year 2000 and we could return in detail to many of the proposals made recently in the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"The Council and the Commission should vigorously defend the full negotiating approach of the European Union in Seattle."
"In our report, we also demand that the Commission be successful in this matter and return with the right results."
"Our negotiating approach must mirror our importance as the largest trading region in the world and, at the same time, meet our responsibility for worldwide economic balance of interests, above all vis-à-vis developing countries."
"What should our focal points be in all this?"
"What is really important?"
"Should the expansion of the world trade system and the opening up of markets be the main focus or should the defence of our European economic and social model, of the social and ecological market economy and of the Community policies developed in the interest of citizens and consumers take a prominent position?"
"In my opinion we should do both, even if there is a certain tension between the two."
"Both objectives are of equal importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as was shown in Monday evening' s vote."
"We are now approaching a further opening up of the worldwide market."
"Tariffs must be further reduced and technical trade barriers should disappear."
"Our markets also should be further opened up to developing countries, in particular those which are least developed, and to the ACP countries."
"The understanding of citizens must be promoted and increased through greater transparency of the WTO rules and its crucially important dispute settlement system."
"On the other hand, the obligations of the European Union under other international agreements, for example the World Health Organisation or the international labour organisations, must also be made clear and be taken into account in the WTO negotiations."
"However, we are moving towards the inefficiency which results from overloading the WTO rules with objectives other than the principle objective of trade liberalisation and non-discrimination against contracting parties."
"So, for example, the basic working conditions and social clauses which were adopted in 1998 by the ILO must be kept current within the framework of a working forum drawn from the ILO and the WTO and must be brought into the discussion and taken into consideration without necessarily changing the WTO rules."
"If we assume that fair and free world trading has been the basis for the increase in prosperity of many countries and their people, and particularly developing countries, then we must also realise that, as the largest trading power in the world, the European Union has a basic interest in building on this success story and involving more and more peoples and countries globally."
"For this we need allies."
"We must link our interests with those of the pre-accession states in Europe, of our neighbours in Europe and of the developing countries, in particular the ACP countries."
"Furthermore, we need constant dialogue with the government, Congress and people of the United States, which will clarify our motives and build mutual understanding for a reasonable balance of interests with our partner."
"Through increased trade we will contribute to the extension of world peace, to prosperity and, if we organise ourselves properly, to greater social justice."
"The extent of our responsibility determines our strategy."
"It must be comprehensive, it must strive for balance in the benefits gained worldwide and it must be convincing for our partners."
"Market participants must have the easiest possible access to all markets in the world."
"The rules in force for this must be fair and must be based on the mutual granting of advantages and imposition of duties."
"The four basic freedoms of the internal market - the freedom to move, the free movement of goods, the freedom of services and the free movement of capital - must also be objectives which are valid worldwide."
"We are in favour of the conclusion of a Multilateral Environmental Agreement, which should then be taken into consideration within the framework of the WTO."
"In the area of services, which, above all for European suppliers, is the largest growth market, market access should be improved and new areas should be included, concerning which the European Parliament should certainly be clearly heard."
"We are in favour of the permanent integration and promotion of electronic commerce within the framework of GATT."
"The resolutions of the Uruguay Round on government procurement must be applied."
"Long term, a large number of the bilateral investment protection agreements within the framework of the World Trade Organisation must be replaced by comprehensive multilateral regulation."
"Competition within the liberated markets must become more effective and competition authorities must be set up accordingly."
"The European agricultural model of rural sustainable agriculture, which is based on the preservation of rural areas, the environment and our quality produce, as well as the production of foodstuffs, should be retained."
"Opposition should be met with reference to the rapidly increasing support practice of the US government."
"Finally, a further word on development cooperation: it must be updated and expanded within the framework of the ACP Partnership."
"The world trade system is based, in key areas, on the contribution of Europeans and Americans."
"In the 60s, at the same time as introducing the common external tariff, we also adopted, in the various Kennedy Rounds and others, a consistent policy worldwide of reducing tariffs and opening up markets."
"The result was the opening up of new markets in third countries, but also the opening up of our markets for other industrial states."
"By way of conclusion, may I thank the Secretariat, our advisers and all those in Parliament who have worked together on this report."
"We had very little time and our technical and other departments worked magnificently."
"Mr President, Europe' s new role in the world will be conditioned by external and security policy, but also by the tensions between social, economic and political needs."
"The world trade round is therefore exceptionally important in Europe speaking with a single voice in world trade negotiations so that social and environmentally-friendly growth can also gather pace through the contribution of world trade."
"Since 1990 there has been a worldwide increase in mergers and also the market power of transnational concerns."
"It is therefore very important that the Millennium Round creates multilateral rules against private restrictions in competition."
"An international competition system must create minimum norms so as to prevent anti-competitive behaviour such as the forming of price and area cartels, the misuse of a market-dominant position or vertical and horizontal competitive restrictions which distort competition."
"Part of these minimum norms must be the obligation for WTO Member States to bring their domestic competition law into line with multilateral agreements and minimum norms."
"This means that the Millennium Round must not create a global cartel authority."
"It must, however, subject domestic competition rules to monitoring."
"It would be contrary to the rules of GATT, CFSP and WTO if free and fair world trade between states were valid, but not for private economic players."
"Monopolies and cartels damage consumers and societies."
"The Microsoft case in the USA clearly demonstrated this."
"The increasing willingness for mergers between transnational companies and the impotence of the national state with regard to the formation of monopolies, oligopolies and cartels endanger the objectives of world trade to contribute to prosperity and peace worldwide."
"Furthermore, it is also particularly important that we realise that the decrease in growth in the world economy is also linked to the instability of the international finance system, which is characterised by vast, rapid and worldwide financial transactions and which has detached itself from the real economy, yet still affects investments, growth and employment."
"For this reason, the Millennium Round must contribute to coherence in the world economy between trade, economic, currency and financial policies."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Legal Committee, for which I had the pleasure of being rapporteur, I would like to warmly welcome the rapporteur' s well-balanced resolution."
"In my opinion, the rapporteur has succeeded in sending out three signals in the report: to our worldwide partners, a signal of the resolve of the European Union; to our people, a signal for a human face to globalisation; and to our citizens, a signal of the parliamentary dimension of the WTO process."
"In this resolution, the Parliament is giving the Commission full backing for Seattle."
"Our message to our partners is that we are solidly behind our negotiating leaders in Seattle - as solidly as the European Alps, I would say."
"All the participants should be aware of this."
"Our second signal is to the people who sceptically oppose globalisation."
"We want to give the markets a worldwide framework as well."
"We can and we desire to bring about globalisation."
"The market system will keep pace with its global development and so we are following a liberal and antiprotectionist tendency."
"The losers in globalisation or those who support it should know that they have an advocate."
"Finally, we would like to state quite clearly that this Millennium Round also has a parliamentary dimension."
"This is indispensable because it is no longer just about the reduction of tariffs and quotas; it is also about elementary matters such as social concern, environmental protection and fair competition."
"We should also make this clear to the non-governmental organisations."
"The place for political debate on the Millennium Round in Europe is the European Parliament."
"The governments are not negotiating this with non-governmental organisations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the closer we get to the Millennium Round, the greater the need for explaining to our people why exactly we want to have a new liberalisation round within the framework of the WTO."
"Each of us who has recently had anything to do with the non-governmental organisations has had to constantly hear that the major liberalisation step since the Uruguay Round has not been the absolute non plus ultra."
"And quite right!"
"There is greater dissatisfaction among the poorer countries because people are wondering where all the promised prosperity has gone, who has cashed in and how the poor have become even poorer."
"This is shown by the facts of the UNCTAD and OECD reports."
"This should not be the case!"
"It is not for me at this time to elaborate on the advantages which we will gain from the next liberalisation step."
"That will be done by my colleagues."
"It is my job to point out previous failings and our inability to provide social balance in the world."
"For this reason, we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs naturally stand up primarily for the personal situation of those affected and for their rights and bring this to the debate."
"This is of particular importance in the poorer countries especially; countries which have a worse democratic/political tendency."
"We want free world trade to be tied in with the basic questions of future policy, our future, the questions of social harmony and environmental concerns."
"We do not want to support any new protectionism - absolutely not; rather, we want the seven core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation to also be guaranteed for workers in the ACP and developing countries."
"Why the seven core Labour Standards?"
"These seven core Labour Standards are based on the four basic human rights in the workplace; the right of association and to organise freely and unhindered, the right to form trade unions, the right to freedom from forced labour and the right to a childhood."
"We still have five-year olds standing or sitting at the loom whilst their parents have no work."
"This is nothing new!"
"Or the right not to suffer discrimination on grounds of sex, religion, political persuasion or national or ethical background."
"We want these rights to also be afforded to workers in the poorer countries."
"At this very time when new partners such as China are joining us within the framework of the WTO, this is of particular importance."
"What I have been speaking about is the real concern of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, namely to provide the workers of these countries with a tool to defend themselves, the right to be able to defend themselves."
"This in itself can provide more social balance."
"This, Commissioner, also belongs on the negotiating table and is our concern."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the Millennium Round and its opening is to be a success, then we must immediately address and pin down some basic problems."
"These are of course areas - and I shall mention a few of them - determined by the Environment Committee where, in the past, we have found deficiencies, areas where there are loopholes, areas where we noticed snags and catches."
"I will now mention a few of the most important of these areas which the Environment Committee has determined and which it considers to be important."
"For example, as regards the precautionary principle, this must be clearly defined and we must have a definition as adopted at the Conference on the Environment and Development in Rio."
"This precautionary principle must be anchored in the WTO rules and regulations in a legally binding manner."
"Secondly, it must be possible to implement, for example, the Multilateral Environment Agreement without triggering conflicts with the WTO."
"Thirdly, the issue of providing information to consumers on preparation and production methods, commonly referred to as PPMs, and the possibility for Member States to take non-discriminatory measures."
"These issues must be included in the WTO negotiations."
"Allow me to say something on the dispute settlement procedure."
"The dispute settlement procedure, with which we have always had so many problems in the past, and many dispute procedures which we did have concerned the areas of environmental policy, consumer protection and animal protection, must become more transparent."
"It must ensure that scientific expertise is independent and unambiguous and then it must also be recognised."
"It must not be the case, as with hormones, that the European Union is able to provide scientific expertise on the danger of hormones whilst we are obliged to pay compensation."
"Such situations must not be repeated in the future."
"I have only mentioned a few of the most important points which my colleagues designate time and again as being important, because everyone will keep saying that in the World Trade Organisation environmental issues and consumer protection issues must be cited as a central theme."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs and my colleagues in the Industry Committee, and this does not go without saying and is not always the case, for incorporating many of the points which were determined in the Environment Committee in the final report, for including them in the amendments of the rapporteur and in the compromise amendments so that much of what the Environment Committee considers important for Seattle has been taken up in the report of Mr Schwaiger."
"Mr Lamy, I therefore now ask you and the Commission to take up these points which I have mentioned here, and also more comprehensive points, to cement these basic points in the opening round and to ensure that in the Millennium Round in the coming years we can further develop them so that the World Trade Organisation is what we would like it to be - a social, just, environmentally-friendly trade organisation which allows us to conduct trade whilst allowing our people and our environment to exist."
"Mr President, the experience of implementing the current WTO agreement for five years and the conflicts and disputes that it has created between countries shows that free and fair trade cannot be confined to straightforward issues of price ratios, subsidies and tariffs."
"For this reason, I would like to highlight four points for the forthcoming negotiations."
"Firstly, we must preserve the European farm model, which authorises precisely the plurality of functions that agriculture performs for society and which would be threatened if excessive liberalisation of the food processing industry were to take place."
"Secondly, we must establish a set of rules which are common to everyone with regard to areas currently not covered or insufficiently covered by the Marrakech Agreement, examples of which are health and hygiene standards, the effects on the environment and on health caused by certain methods of intensive production and the respect for consumers' feelings."
"Thirdly, we must ensure that the designations of origin of the Community' s traditional products are respected so that we do not see more of the real piracy that is taking place with impunity with regard to Community brand names, as is happening in South Africa, as a matter of fact, with regard to Port, Sherry, Ouzo and Grappa."
"As far as this is concerned, I think that the decision taken on Monday 15 November by the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs constitutes a dangerous retreat and a dangerous act of hesitation in view of the negotiations that are about to take place."
"Fourthly, we need to ensure that all subsidies allocated to the agricultural policies' different objectives are classified according to the same criteria."
"A scenario that must not be repeated, for example, is the classification of European export restrictions as yellow box, as a result of which, they have to be reduced in six years, whereas American export credits, which are exactly the same, are not subjected to any restrictions at all."
"To conclude, it is important to mention the fact that the Europeans have, for a while, been taking a more offensive stand in the negotiations on the WTO' s agricultural project."
"Firstly, because we have implemented two major reforms in the space of seven years - a huge effort - and secondly, because unlike the sacrifices European farmers have been forced to make, the United States of America has increased its subsidies by USD 15 billion in the last two years in blatant contradiction of the line of arrogant propaganda that they are currently taking against the CAP."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Schwaiger for producing an extremely complex report and, in particular, Erica Mann, also for coordinating much of the work in producing amendments to the report."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport takes the view that as regards Seattle we need a holistic approach to audiovisual services."
"In Europe, the audiovisual services involve the cultural industries and also have a huge impact on our economy."
"Our cultural industries have nevertheless been seen, as I said last month, as an addendum to many of the serious trade issues that are going to be discussed at Seattle."
"However, I think that we must grasp the nettle and acknowledge that cultural industries are no longer an addendum to these discussions."
"They will in fact occupy a pivotal position, a pivotal role in the world economy and as such should be treated as a driver of the economy rather than as an afterthought."
"Now given this, the Committee on Culture thinks it is particularly important that the structural framework in which we now operate should be seriously examined."
"It is important nevertheless, given some of the incapacities and deficiencies that exist in the world market, that we maintain the position adopted at the Uruguay Round."
"This is in order to give us an even playing field across the world market, in terms of the cultural industry."
"While we maintain that it is important to look at the intermediate and the long term and to look at the way in which the networks are now impacting across different sectors, the complexity of these networks means that we also need to look at new instruments to deal with the global economy insofar as the structural industries are concerned."
"Mr President, as a farmer I declare an interest. I join in the praise for the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, who has put much work into this excellent report."
"As draftsman for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, my interest is naturally on the effect a new WTO round will have on developing nations."
"A week ago I was convinced that, with hard bargaining, there was some hope a deal could be struck to give a fair balance between providing reasonable protection to the EU industries and agriculture on the one hand and market access for developing countries' goods on the other."
"Now that an agreement has been reached between the USA and China, I wonder what chance small nations like Lesotho or Swaziland have in a globalised free trade market."
"Only strong regional cooperation will give them a chance of survival."
"This round on liberalisation of trade takes place at a time when the gap between developed and less-developed countries is continuing to grow."
"In fact, for large numbers of people in the least-developed countries, there are no benefits."
"The agenda of the Millennium Round comprises only agriculture and services, but the Commission rightly wants a much more comprehensive round."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, the EU will be unable to avoid further concessions in market access."
"The EU cannot pay compensation to its agricultural producers and at the same time block market access for third countries."
"But, in return, the developing countries must improve their core environmental standards and accept that this is not yet another form of protectionism."
"The Development Committee wants to see WTO rules that do not hamper eco-labelling schemes and green public purchasing."
"It also calls for a joint standing working party on trade, globalisation and labour issues to be set up by the ILO and the WTO."
"It calls for an in-depth revision of the TRIPS Agreement and stresses that the patenting of life must definitely be excluded from the TRIPS Agreement."
"It wants to see animal welfare included in discussions."
"The EU must not be bullied by the USA into accepting an agreement that is detrimental to the developing world."
"US domination of the WTO must end."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that, as Mr Schwaiger' s report shows, there is broad consensus among us in the Union on the aims of the forthcoming WTO round."
"We want a broadly based round, increased liberalisation of world trade and, in particular, strengthening of the rule-based system."
"We want to take the interests of developing countries into account and pay special attention to environmental issues and the fundamental rights of workers."
"It is also very important for the Commission and the Council to have the support of Parliament for these aims."
"I would also like to say here that the Commission and Mr Lamy have done much excellent work to prepare us for the WTO round."
"However, in this connection, I do think that it would be most appropriate to attempt to offer a brief explanation on the current situation in Geneva."
"The actual drafting of the ministerial decision for Seattle has at last got under way."
"The various sections of the decision are being examined daily in Geneva."
"Each subject is discussed at the Directors' meeting chaired by Mr Mchumo, Chairman of the WTO General Council, and at the restricted 'green room' meetings chaired by Director-General Moore."
"To speed up the preparations, meetings of technical experts have also begun."
"The EU, under the leadership of the Commission, for its part, has had talks in a smaller group which has produced texts as alternatives to the main points in the ministerial decision."
"This is a decisive time for the preparations."
"There are twelve days left until the commencement of the Seattle meeting."
"We only have until Friday or the weekend to work on the decision."
"The aim is to have a Seattle draft decision with as few points as possible in parentheses or open for discussion."
"It is to be supposed, however, that many decisions will remain to be taken at the Ministerial Conference itself."
"No significant breakthroughs have yet been made regarding the wording of the decision."
"The Ministerial Conference at Lausanne and the meeting between Mr Clinton and Mr Prodi a couple of weeks ago did not provide the political impetus for the preparations that was hoped for."
"It must be admitted that, although in general a crisis is needed in trade talks before any significant breakthroughs are achieved, the situation in Geneva is, at present, more difficult than anticipated."
"I must say that I am genuinely concerned about the situation as it is at present."
"There are still very great differences of opinion regarding the main question: the overall extent of the round."
"The EU and ten or so other WTO members are still very much alone in their call for a broadly based round of talks."
"Most of the WTO members seem to be satisfied with a more condensed agenda, to include, in addition to issues of agriculture and services, access to the markets for industrial products, and one or two other matters."
"Agriculture will be the most difficult area in the talks, and the one that is most likely to end in deadlock."
"The Cairns countries and the USA are calling on the EU to show greater flexibility in agriculture for them to agree to a mandate for a broadly based round."
"To make headway in the debate on this subject we require flexibility on all sides - including ourselves in the Union."
"The second matter that has proved a difficult area of negotiation concerns the implementation of the agreements made at the Uruguay round."
"There would seem to be even greater consensus among the WTO members that the proposals on implementation should be divided, on the one hand, into those questions that can be resolved at Seattle and, on the other, those for which a post-Seattle agenda is necessary."
"At present the broadest consensus would appear to be on the issue of least developed countries."
"Likewise, consensus among the Member States is growing in the areas of trade in services and intellectual property."
"Regarding the so-called new subject areas, the negotiation position is still completely open."
"There has been an attempt not to totally exclude talks on investment and competition, but instead the working parties set up should, by the next meeting of ministers, determine what opportunities there will be to discuss these subjects."
"New subjects would not, however, be included in the negotiations package."
"The EU' s proposal for standards for working life did not receive the backing of the WTO members in the General Council."
"Only the USA supported it."
"A good number of the members want to keep to the decisions of the meeting of ministers at Singapore."
"It remains to be seen how the issue at Geneva will progress, and what sort of decision, if any, can be expected at Seattle."
"The EU has not finally made up its mind whether to include workers' standards in the decision or in a separate decision at Seattle."
"We shall continue with our efforts to convince developing countries in this matter."
"Something of key importance to the success of the preparations is how the EU and the USA can achieve better mutual understanding with regard to each other' s goals."
"As I have already said, the meeting a couple of weeks ago between Mr Prodi and Mr Clinton cannot be regarded as a breakthrough, although it did show a desire on both sides to try and reach solutions."
"What was important for the Union was the wording of the common declaration whereby agriculture and services alone will not guarantee the success of the round."
"The work being done at Geneva thus continues at breakneck speed."
"The EU is still pressing ahead with a broadly based agenda."
"Bargaining over aims and goals in all matters we shall leave for Seattle."
"It is important that we maintain communications with the other parties - in particular, the United States."
"The country to hold the Presidency and the Member States support the work of the Commission to enhance the Geneva process."
"Mr President, on Monday the General Affairs Council adopted the short, separate conclusions concerning preparations by the Ministerial Conference."
"In the Council, ministers expressed their concerns regarding the state of the Geneva talks and urged the Commission to continue with its efforts to ensure that there is a broadly based round."
"In the conclusions of the Council there is a reference to the WTO conclusions adopted on 26 October and a reiteration of support for our aim to have a broadly based round."
"Only a broadly based round will guarantee a fair outcome for all members."
"In addition, the Council stressed the need to be open to the proposals of other countries, especially those from developing countries."
"The Member States also gave their support to the Commission in the last-minute preparations."
"Mr President, the WTO has certainly succeeded in significantly increasing international trade and worldwide economic production and in removing trade barriers."
"But what about increasing quality of life, participation in growth development and the creation of new, socially acceptable jobs?"
"In order to reduce the gap between the worst and best developed national economies there must also be agreed social and environmental standards as well as consumer and health protection."
"This is not a playground for illusionists; in fact, the opposite."
"Here we are trying to gain the acceptance of the general public."
"We must succeed in making an exception of those states which, for the sake of short-term gains, permit or even induce production which is damaging to the environment and cements social grievances."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is agreed that states which meet basic social and environmental standards should be especially protected during integration into the world economy."
"We must bring about a situation where it becomes more difficult to sell products unless they have markings such as ""resources obtained with care"" or ""produced in an environmentally-friendly manner"" or ""guaranteed not manufactured by children"" . We want to persuade consumers to prefer such products."
"The WTO rules and regulations must be amended such that these voluntary declarations may no longer be hindered."
"Two further points belong on the agenda in Seattle: firstly, investment agreements on the basis of the ILO declaration on multinational companies and the corresponding OECD guidelines in which workers' rights are taken into account; secondly, the setting up of a permanent forum between the WTO and the ILO to consider the acceptance of basic workers' rights, i.e. the abolition of forced and slave labour, the outlawing of child labour and prohibition of discrimination."
"The excellent report by Konrad Schwaiger, which deserves consensus and a majority, makes clear that this is about more than just trade policy; it is about the participation of all countries on the basis of equal rights, social progress and the enforcement of human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on Monday the committee approved the report of Mr Schwaiger with a large majority and I must say how pleased I am with the overall way in which Mr Schwaiger has lead the debate."
"He has shown great openness which has, in turn, lead to us putting forward compromises which are not really compromises in the sense that they do not negate positions defended by individual groups; rather, we have genuinely fought and wrestled to find a European compromise, a European formulation which fully supports the position of the Council and of the Commission."
"This is what it is all about."
"I am very grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for pointing out the overall difficulties which exist in opening this new negotiating round in Seattle."
"We ought to be realistic and not fool ourselves: it will not be easy, in Seattle and beyond, to steer the course which we plan and hope to follow in Europe, particularly where it goes against the interests of our negotiating partners."
"Nevertheless, I wish you, Commissioner Lamy, and all those who are involved, the best of luck."
"I can assure you that you have the support of my group."
"We will give you our unqualified support."
"However, the difficult opening also means, and we should not fool ourselves, that the old consensus which influenced the interplay between open world trade and binding trade rules and which always assumed that there was an essentially positive influence on national developments has since begun to crumble."
"Even in the rich countries, in particular the United States, which have profited most from open markets, the increasing number of international competitors within the framework of the World Trade Organisation has lead, ironically I might add, to growing scepticism and concern that globalisation is also bringing with it impoverishment, destruction of the environment and the loss of national sovereignty."
"And with the loss of foreign policy as a whole, the temptation is also growing to accept foreign economy as a replacement."
"The Socialist Group unreservedly supports the efforts of the Commission and the Council for a comprehensive negotiating round."
"Only this strategy can ensure that all the issues which have a European interest are truly given full consideration."
"Only in this way will it eventually become clear where the advantages and disadvantages for European states and European citizens lie."
"This is why we are also in favour of a single undertaking process."
"Nothing is decided until all the issues are on the table."
"It is also necessary for the Parliament to be fully informed and involved."
"This is particularly important because so many issues, especially new issues, as many of my colleagues have already mentioned, are of an extremely emotive nature, for example, the issues of how we can include investments in the scope of the world trade round, new rules on competition, social and working standards and much more."
"Parliament must be fully involved."
"The citizens and non-governmental organisations and companies of the European Union will follow negotiations in Seattle more intently than ever before and will focus their attention on the questions of whether world trade is generally becoming fairer, more socially-conscious and more well-balanced and whether it can take into account the interests of every party."
"The feelings against an untamed globalisation process, which are marked by a basic scepticism, will come to the fore during the negotiations."
"It is therefore necessary for us social democrats to make clear where the opportunities lie and where the globalisation process can have a more positive influence in the future."
"But we shouldn' t fool ourselves: less WTO does not automatically mean less globalisation."
"That is an illusion!"
"It means less globalisation which can be influenced."
"In this respect, I would once again like to make it absolutely clear that the Commission and the Council have our support."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, on his outstanding efforts in forging a broad cross-party approach to this hugely important issue, which will have consequences for us all for many years to come."
"The ELDR remains unambiguously supportive of further trade liberalisation, of the strengthening of the multilateral trade system and of a broadly based negotiation covering a wide range of existing and new trade matters."
"Our hope is that this report, when adopted by Parliament tomorrow, will serve as a clear signal of our political backing for a comprehensive round at a crucial stage in the preparations for Seattle."
"This Parliament also has a central role in allaying legitimate public fears about the consequences of globalisation."
"In some quarters a misplaced view has arisen that the WTO is a malign agent for all the negative effects of globalisation."
"In truth, without the WTO we would be unable to construct the global legal and regulatory architecture which is indispensable to any coherent political response to globalisation."
"Without the WTO the law of the jungle and the power of might over right would prevail - hardly an outcome the critics of the WTO would welcome."
"For these reasons we have been active in tabling a series of amendments to the report, pushing for the development of new WTO rules in areas such as the environment, now directly affected by international trade policy."
"We have supported all efforts to strengthen the place of developing countries in the world trade system, not least by underlining the inescapable need for continued reform of the EU' s common agricultural policy."
"We have also pushed, and will continue to do so, to ensure the WTO is more transparent and the European Commission more accountable to the European Parliament in the conduct of trade policy."
"This must include, as a minimum, an automatic Parliamentary right to subject any WTO deal to assent and much greater access to the negotiating briefs discussed within the Council."
"At the same time the ELDR has resisted all attempts to burden this report with a shopping list of sector-specific requests."
"That is why tomorrow we will vote against those sections of the report which call for exceptional treatment for particular sectors."
"We must accept the consequences of our support for a comprehensive trade round."
"Comprehensive means all-encompassing; it does not mean riddled with exceptions."
"Finally, a word on China."
"Late on Sunday night a bilateral deal was struck between the US and China on China' s accession to the WTO."
"China' s entry into the WTO will, arguably, have as far-reaching an effect as anything which will take place in Seattle."
"It is impossible to separate the question of China' s accession to the WTO from our wider consideration of the EU' s position in Seattle."
"The EU is in a delicate position as the last major WTO player not to have concluded a deal with China."
"An optimistic interpretation would suggest that Europe is now in a strong position to exploit and build on the concessions already secured from China by Washington."
"However, the fact that European Commission negotiating officials were reported a mere week before the US deal as discounting the likelihood of Chinese accession any time soon may suggest that the European Union has not been negotiating as convincingly as might be hoped."
"There is clearly a risk that Europe will now be forced into a corner in the talks with China."
"The ELDR has always strongly supported Chinese accession to the WTO but not at the cost of legitimate European interests, which do not always converge with American commercial interests."
"I therefore call on the Commission to give an urgent account of the Chinese accession talks to Parliament, and particularly as to how they may affect our preparations for Seattle, so that Parliament can vote tomorrow on Mr Schwaiger' s report in full command of all the relevant facts."
"With these important caveats in mind, I would like to confirm the ELDR' s broad support for Mr Schwaiger' s work and reiterate our warm thanks to him."
"Mr President, in his introduction Mr Schwaiger says that the goal of the World Trade Organisation is free trade."
"But trade is not an end in itself."
"It is a means to an end."
"That end must be sustainable development."
"So even if the volume of world trade has increased 17-fold, what use is that unless it benefits poor people and promotes sustainable development?"
"The uncomfortable truth is that there are losers as well as winners from international trade."
"Many of the losers are poor people who find their land taken away from them by large commercial firms or their livelihoods destroyed by new and often unfair competition from cheaper imports."
"That is why our Group believes that before we rush headlong into yet more trade rounds in Seattle we first need a comprehensive impact assessment of the social and environmental effects of the liberalisation that has already taken place as a result of the last Uruguay Round of trade negotiations."
"We also need much bolder action to ensure poor people genuinely benefit from world trade."
"Frankly, that is where this report is still inadequate."
"We need tariff-free access for least-developed countries, not only for virtually all products - that is a phrase that leaves a giant loophole for the EU to continue protecting its own agriculture - but for all products from those countries."
"We need an end to the hugely damaging dumping of subsidised agricultural exports on developing country markets."
"We need industrialised countries to make legally binding their commitments to give special and differential treatment to poorer countries."
"But, above all, when we see evidence that world trade rules are destroying poor people' s livelihoods or damaging the environment we need to change the rules."
"Let me say very clearly that free trade is not the same as fair trade."
"Nothing demonstrates that more clearly than the case of the Caribbean banana farmers, some of the most vulnerable producers in the world, whose access to the EU markets has now been ruled against WTO rules, as a result of which they face a devastation of their livelihoods."
"So, I repeat, if world trade rules are destroying people' s livelihoods and damaging the environment or animal welfare we need to change the rules."
"Mr President, we are all aware that in Seattle the stakes are high and of exceptional importance for the lives of the world' s citizens."
"It is not a question of technical matters that might concern groups of specialists from ministries of foreign trade."
"This is also evident from the fervour of the debate underway in Parliament, although it is still weak in decision-making power, but there have been new events in recent years that are taking supremacy away from the specialists."
"In Seattle, at the same time as the governmental meeting, thousands of NGOs will meet, thousands of men and women from civil society who are calling urgently for the WTO not to become one of the seats of that global government, based on the growth and supremacy of the most unbridled free trade, which does not take into account the growing poverty of the population of the least industrialised and weakest countries, the destruction of the environment, the protection of natural and human resources or the differences and diversities within each country, all in the name of globalisation, which is continuing to create wealth for a few and poverty for many."
"It is an exceptional fact of democracy that thousands of men and women have debated together and demonstrated in favour of a different kind of economy, directly linked to daily life and democracy, because the fact that 134 governments are members of the WTO does not in itself guarantee transparency or democracy in decision-making processes because, over and above formal statutes, what really exists is the contractual power exercised by the strongest governments and multinationals."
"Because of these fundamental considerations, we do not agree with the Schwaiger report, although we acknowledge his thoroughness."
"We would like the European Parliament to adopt a clear, firm stand to the effect that the right to dignity, health, a home, freedom and the elimination of poverty is more important than free trade and profits."
"With regard to the United States' frantic rush to defend its own interests, we of course recognise that Europe is maintaining a position concerned with the defence of more human traditions, but we do not feel this is enough: it is not enough to state high-sounding principles - we must put them into practice."
"Many things in the Schwaiger report are positive: the defence of our agriculture, cultural diversity and more besides, but I will limit myself, because of time restrictions, to only mentioning some of the fundamental issues."
"The issue of agreements on intellectual property rights is very important."
"We agree with the NGOs and many countries which have suffered through these agreements that there should be a moratorium to renegotiate them."
"Just think of India, whose legislation does not provide for copyright on medicines or foodstuffs; yet India produces herbs that are used by multinationals and ourselves to treat illnesses; or Mandela' s South Africa, where, in retaliation for his attempt to make treatment for AIDS victims more accessible, the WTO imposed a withdrawal of cheaper medicines."
"We support the south African countries' request not to negotiate whether plants and animals or human cells can be genetically modified and patented, which would take money from the weak and make multinationals bigger."
"We also consider the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety fundamental, because we do not want to be overrun with genetically modified food, and we therefore think it necessary to reverse the burden of proof and we consider that the experts must really be independent of the interests of governments or multinationals."
"We want to safeguard workers' rights, the right to strike, and apply codes of conduct that this Parliament..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, if the Commission had not already accustomed us to this sort of vagueness conducive to the extension of its own power, the Schwaiger report would plunge us into a sea of confusion."
"Of course, the thinking displayed by the Commission and taken up in the report offers no grounds for concern."
"There, one can detect only extremely virtuous motives, as on every occasion when general principles and noble ideas are being aired."
"However, it is the overzealousness which is demonstrated, and which the Schwaiger report faithfully echoes, which prompts legitimate suspicions, especially if we choose to recall that these same principles have only recently been flouted in connection with bananas, GMOs and hormone-treated beef, on which the European Union, represented by the Commission, suffered a defeat which came about so quickly as to pass unnoticed."
"Given this recent precedent, and pending a proper assessment of the previous round, we thought it prudent to wait before throwing ourselves headlong into negotiations whose value still remains to be proven and where the rules of the game are apparently not the same for the European Union and for our main partner and competitor, the United States."
"But if the Commission is eager to commit the European Union to these negotiations, it is because, once committed, the Member States cease to be free agents."
"The Commission is claiming their support on the grounds that they have already exercised their sovereign prerogatives during the preliminary negotiations."
"What is the truth of the matter? The Commission has been granted a mandate which is already the result of an intergovernmental compromise."
"Yet it must be able to negotiate, and thus make concessions on that basis."
"How can agreements be reached?"
"Is there a list of no-go areas and another of designated victims?"
"If the Commission' s wishes are granted, the WTO' s remit will embrace practically all human activities and will create a world in which everything is an item of merchandise, including our public services and our culture."
"Can we seriously ignore the fact that the specific characteristics of our education, public health or welfare systems would not survive this?"
"If the plan described here cannot be modified now or in future, what strategy is the Commission going to adopt?"
"President Clinton' s Trade Representative, Mrs Barshefsky, who successfully fought Washington' s battles on bananas, GMOs and American beef, has sought the help of the American business community, which has provided her with a 31-page document detailing the desiderata of their industries."
"Do we have anything similar to set against this?"
"We believe that only the Member States are in a position to frame appropriate policies which would properly safeguard our interests in this area."
"Mr President, we find the report by our fellow Member, Mr Schwaiger, regarding the WTO Millennium Round, completely satisfactory, since it goes in the direction of respect for differences, be they cultural or economic."
"I wish to congratulate him on this considerable work on a subject as complex and polemical as the WTO."
"In this Chamber we have already clearly expressed our concerns and reservations with regard to this new round of negotiations."
"I am, however, pleased that French demands regarding cultural diversity and social standards have been taken into account."
"Like the rapporteur, we share the concern of defending the specificity of the pluralist European farm model, based on family farms, which are often subjected to significant geographical and environmental constraints."
"In the face of globalisation, it is essential to take account of these differences which considerably change the rules of the economic game, with drastic consequences in social terms."
"The urgent need to establish a more democratic negotiating system, operating in a more transparent way, seems justified, in my view."
"It is indeed essential for parliaments to be involved in on-going consultation, with real respect for the procedures."
"We are indeed very concerned about the Council and the Commission' s remarkable capacity to withhold information."
"I also deplore the fact that the recommendations made to the Commission regarding small and medium-sized enterprises were limited to customs duties."
"All procedures for these small and medium-sized enterprises should be simplified, since these are the only businesses capable of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs."
"Finally, I appreciate the fact that Mr Schwaiger stressed the precautionary principle, in order to integrate environmental policies into trade policies, and I share his concern regarding the risks of a putative eco-protectionism which has nothing to do with the protection of citizens' health."
"Mr President, Mr Schwaiger, I would like to thank your for dealing with this complex matter so thoroughly and for seeking to forge a path towards a broad consensus."
"It makes no sense in this WTO Round to negotiate according to the motto ""I might not know where I' m going, but I' ll be the first to get there!"" ."
"It is about citizens profiting in the long term from the globalisation and liberalisation of trade."
"It is therefore a personal concern of mine that the outcome of the negotiations should be understood and accepted by the people."
"In Europe today we have extremely high standards, both with regard to environmental and consumer protection and to social protection of workers."
"During the course of the forthcoming negotiations, these must not be dismantled, nor undermined."
"Our trade partners must be persuaded of the importance of these matters."
"I support the call to apply the precautionary principle and sustainability in all sectors."
"In the agricultural sector specifically, the results of Berlin must be the absolute lower limit in the negotiations since the situation of small rural family enterprises and of farmers in difficult geographical areas should not be disregarded."
"In the matter of social standards we cannot afford any shipwreck."
"I am therefore pragmatic."
"I am concerned that in reality the contents of the 1998 ILO Conference will crop up."
"We should not make the mistake of alarming our negotiating partners with such massive demands."
"I therefore advocate the institutionalisation of the cooperation of the WTO and the ILO."
"Liberalisation has clearly had positive effects."
"However, it cannot be the case that at the end of the day the rich get richer and the poor get poorer!"
"In this negotiating round Europe must truly speak with a single voice if we wish to assert ourselves against the USA."
"However, this voice must not just be the position of the powerful or of a few globalisation fanatics, but must represent the interests of the small and medium-sized companies which form the backbone of our economic strength."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor to remind you once more that, since the start of this parliamentary term, the Radical Members have not been taking part either in the votes in the House or in the committees: this is to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Members to the fact that some of the Members are denied the chance to contribute to parliamentary life on the same grounds and by the same means as the other Members."
"The indifference with which the Presidency and the Members have been listening, for around four months, to our protest and have been passively accepting the situation is a clear sign of the contradiction between their convictions and democratic practice."
"Mr President, once again I support what Mr Turco just said."
"I, too, as a member of the Italian Social Movement, am on strike, and will therefore not be taking part in any of the votes."
"Yesterday I announced that I will be abstaining from voting for the whole session - and you can read this in the verbatim report of yesterday' s sitting - and this is for the reasons that Mr Turco has explained so lucidly."
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0056/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action (the Daphne Programme) (2000-2003) on preventive measures to fight violence against children, young persons and women (9150/1/1999 - C5-0181/1999 - 1998/0192(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Avilés Perea)"
"Before proceeding to the votes, in accordance with Rule 80(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I would ask the Commission to clarify its position regarding the amendments."
"Mr President, the Commission was able to accept the six proposed amendments."
"Now there are just four."
"Having accepted all six, I therefore accept the four, Mr President."
"(Parliament adopted the common position thus amended)"
"Report (A5-0052/1999) by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the system of the European Union' s own resources (COM(1999) 333 - C5-0092/1999 - 1999/0139(CNS))"
"Mr President, I would like to raise three issues with regard to this report."
"Firstly, I have been given a voting list on which Amendment No 9 is not identified as an amendment by the Committee on Budgets."
"I would like this mistake to be rectified, at least on the voting list that has been attributed to my political group."
"Secondly, there is an Amendment No 31 that only existed in the German version until yesterday afternoon, and the Portuguese and English language versions contradict each other. The Portuguese version talks of the GNP whereas the English version talks about the GDP."
"These are two completely different financial concepts which have completely different financial consequences. I have no idea what this amendment means."
"Thirdly, I would like the Bureau to explain to me why it intends to proceed to a vote on Amendment No 31 when Amendment No 9 is established in our Rules of Procedure, Rule 130(2); in other words, why this amendment is moving further away from the original."
"As for your first question, Mr Casaca, I must tell you that Amendment No 9 is a Commission amendment: it appears on the ballot paper and in the correct way."
"The base text is in German."
"The reference text, which we are voting on, is the German one."
"As for Amendment No 31, it is a compromise amendment tabled by the rapporteur, and therefore must be voted on first."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I should like your clarification that when you are looking around the Chamber and judging how many people vote for or against, you are not taking into account any political preference."
"I am sure you are not, but I would hate my British Socialist colleagues to be embarrassed by the way they have just voted, in some cases against the UK budget rebate."
"Mr Heaton-Harris, if you have doubts about what I announced then you must ask for an electronic confirmation of the outcome of the vote, as other Members do when they have doubts."
"It is quite simple."
"The last remark you made, though, was offensive."

"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Recommendation for second reading of the Avilés Perea report (A5-0056/1999)"
"Mr President, in my opinion, it was very important for the European Parliament and the Council to reach a decision on the Daphne programme for 2000-2003."
"To guarantee compliance with the common Treaty we should take a positive view of this kind of project."
"In order to achieve a high level of health we must attend to physical, mental and social needs."
"Violence against women and domestic violence are multidimensional problems, which have serious and wide-ranging effects on health."
"This is not only about violations of human rights, but about barriers to equality and development."
"The fear of violence and harassment is a hindrance to children, young people and women, making it difficult for them to participate fully in normal social life."
"Violence is also responsible for considerable economic, social and health costs to individuals, Member States and the whole Community."
"We must also remember that yesterday, in this House, an agreement on the rights of children was discussed."
"This agreement, too, emphasises a child' s right to a safe life and the recognition of his or her human dignity."
"In my country, Finland, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has launched a project for 1998 - 2002 to prevent violence against women; the endorsement of the Daphne programme was very important also from this standpoint."
"The project will focus on violence against women, a reinforcement of the attitudes towards violence, a reduction in the level of violence as well as the development and enhancement of services for victims and the perpetrators of violence."
"One way to achieve these goals is to develop international cooperation, relying on an exchange of good working methods and experience, and on networking, especially within the EU."
"Weeding out violence will only be possible through continued efforts."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today been delighted to vote in favour of Mrs Avilés Perea' s report on the Daphne programme."
"Violence is an infringement of fundamental human rights, which we should oppose."
"Efforts to combat violence against children, young people and women ought to have a high priority in our work."
"It is an important political signal we are here today to send out."
"- (FR) The European Parliament and, more particularly, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, whose work I wish to acknowledge, have played a primordial role in raising awareness about violence against women and children on the European scale."
"This scourge of society, alas, takes different forms."
"It goes from prostitution, the trafficking of women and children, which is revolting to most citizens, to domestic violence, a phenomenon which is tolerated or ignored since it occurs within the private sphere!"
"A great many initiatives have been undertaken already in this field, resulting in creating an increase in collective awareness on the subject."
"This favourable background must be exploited and actions must be increased in order to finally eliminate all these forms of violence."
"The Daphne programme bears witness to this desire to tackle the problem in a coordinated fashion at Member States level, while integrating candidate countries."
"It represents an essential tool in the fight against violence of this type."
"While there is general agreement in acknowledging that violence against women transcends all national barriers without distinction as to class, culture and/or age, there is nonetheless no structured mechanism which makes it possible to gain an objective idea of the extent of the problem within the European Union."
"Indeed, the systematic recording of acts of violence against women is a very recent phenomenon in some countries, whereas in others there is no systematic record at all."
"However, the medium-term action programme will no doubt prove extremely useful to decision makers and will feed into political decisions and practices in this field."
"This programme will have the goal of reinforcing the scope of local, regional and national actions by establishing networks, information exchange, best practice and cooperation, and by increasing public awareness."
"The Council has included more than half of our amendments in its common position."
"We should be pleased with this."
"The Council' s text in fact makes reference to health in its physical, mental and social aspects and to quality of life, as well as to violence as an infringement of human rights."
"It is explicitly stipulated that victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation shall be covered by the programme."
"We must, certainly, deplore the fact that the duration of the programme has been reduced to four years instead of five, as envisaged originally."
"The budget allocated (EUR 20 million) is also insufficient to tackle a problem as far-reaching as this."
"In spite of these reservations, I shall today be voting in favour of the compromise text proposed by the Council."
"If we wish to eradicate the phenomenon of violence which blights our society, we must make a firm commitment right now."
"The implementation of this programme must not be delayed further."
"- Madam President, I, of course, welcome the introduction of the new EU Daphne Programme."
"This Daphne Programme will be put in place for the period 2000-2004."
"Its primary function relates to the introduction of measures to combat violence against children, young persons and women."
"This commands the overwhelming support of non-governmental organisations and women' s groups within the European Union."
"Total funding will amount to £20 million and this will be allocated in two principal areas - the exchange of information and cooperation at Community level and the raising of public awareness."
"The Daphne Programme will aim to promote information campaigns on potential risks of violence and ways of avoiding them, encourage pilot projects and innovative measures and help to create a Community information source to assist NGOs."
"I support this programme because of its social values."
"However, rehabilitation programmes for children, young people and women must be an intrinsic part of this new initiative."
"On a broader level, I support the debate taking place today on the need to promote equality in our society."
"It is important in the context of the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 that measures under the various EU programmes be screened so as to guarantee that they comply with all national and EU legislation in the field of equal opportunities."
"The enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year also substantially strengthens the legal basis for Community action in favour of the equality between men and women."
"Equality between men and women is also at the heart of new European Employment Policies."
"The European Commission, of course, analyses very carefully all action plans on employment which are forwarded to us on an annual basis by the EU Member States so as to ensure that comprehensive and streamlined measures to promote equality in our society are supported."
"- (FR) This Daphne programme is one which we, all of us, wished for, we, the Members of the European Parliament, but also all the organisations, both non-governmental and other types of organisations, and associations working in the delicate area of violence against children, young people and women."
"The Council has curtailed the duration of the programme - 4 years instead of the 5 originally envisaged, but the budgetary allocation remains the same."
"The rapporteur did an excellent job of negotiating with the Council, with the outcome that our three key amendments were accepted both by the Commission and by the Council."
"These amendments primarily concern the necessary reference to the concept of the physical and emotional integrity of the individual and thus to the concept of dignity, such that inflicting physical, sexual or psychological violence is tantamount to depriving that person of their human rights. Secondly, the definition of ""public health"" , as defined by the WHO, i.e. not only the absence of disease or infirmity, but a state of physical, mental and social well being is taken up in the report."
"Thirdly, the encouragement to be given to organisations and associations in general working in this sector is stressed. Fourthly, last but not least, reference is made to public and media information and awareness on these painful social matters."
"There are, then, great expectations, and it is imperative for our House to vote on this matter and, according to the rules of codecision, we must mobilise the 314 votes necessary for the Daphne programme to be adopted."
"This is why I can do no more than urge you to vote in favour of this report, unanimously, to avoid further procedural delays (conciliation), and to enable it to come into force in January 2000."
". (PT) It is well known that in the European Union, there are still high levels of violence against children, young people and women, which is a violation of their rights to life, to security, to freedom, to dignity and to physical and mental well-being, as well as a serious threat to the physical and mental health of the victims of violence."
"It is therefore very important that this report has been adopted and our only regret is about the ups and downs throughout the process that have led to its delay, given that it follows the Beijing Conference of 1995."
"We hope that the Daphne 2000-2003 Community action programme will at last be adopted and implemented so that we can support measures designed to prevent violence being perpetrated against children, young people and women."
"Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the budgetary funds that have been set aside for this are so low."
"We hope that they will soon be increased given the gravity of the situation and the fact that there is a vital need to contribute to reducing the suffering that violence continues to cause."
"Haug report (A5-0052/1999)"
"Mr President, Mrs Haug' s report on the European Union' s system of own resources seems rather contradictory to us, and that is why we are opposed to it."
"On the one hand, it declares excellent principles of economy, particularly the idea that the Union' s own resources must be limited to 1.27% of the GNPs of the Member States, a ceiling which the Commission proposal rightly sought to circumvent surreptitiously."
"This position is perhaps due to the rapporteur' s German nationality and the special situation of Germany but, in any case, she is right on this point and we support her on this."
"On the other hand, however, the self-same rapporteur contradicts her own desire for economy by calling, on the lines of the Berlin Council of March 1999, for the creation of new autonomous own resources, i.e. to put it plainly, European taxes."
"I recall that the Pasqua-de Villiers list, on which I stood as a candidate, deplored the Berlin conclusions during the election campaign, but that our rivals managed to cover it up."
"Thus, according to the Berlin Council, and today according to the Haug report, the resources of the European budget should henceforth be made up totally or partially not of State contributions but of direct taxes levied on citizens."
"At the same time, we must expect the power of decision regarding these taxes to be passed quickly from the Council to the European Parliament."
"This development would be in contradiction to our vision of a Union which is an association of states, to which the Members freely pay annual contributions."
"But this is not just a matter of institutional philosophy, it is a practical matter, too."
"Every year we are witness to confrontation over the budget because the Council seeks to resist the extravagant overbidding of the Commission, often with the support of Parliament."
"If we create a European tax, the Council will gradually lose its capacity to resist, and we shall be giving the crucial advantage to those institutions which push to increase the budget. I must therefore appeal to our German friends."
"Please understand that, in arguing in favour of a European tax, in the long term you are betraying that very desire for economy which you defend so ferociously in the short term."
"And since I heard it said in the debate, by Mr Bourlanges, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference was to decide upon the creation of a European tax, I would say, on the other hand, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, that if the IGC is to discuss this matter, it must decide upon the creation of a system that is clear, transparent, fair and, above all, closely supervised by national democracies, by which I mean an annual contribution from Member States based on a percentage of their GNP, which is identical for all Member States."
"- (SV) We are voting against Amendment No 6 but for Mrs Haug' s report as a whole because we think that the way in which the EU' s own resources are constructed ought to be reformed."
"We agree that we ought to have a more direct link between the European Union and its citizens when it comes to financing the EU' s budget and that we ought to be increasing the Union' s economic independence step by step."
"In view of the lack of confidence in the European Union, as evidenced by, among other things, the low turnout at the election, and in view of the importance of preserving the EU' s character as a union both of citizens and of Member States, we consider that it would be wrong to aim now for a financially autonomous EU or one which is totally independent of contributions from the Member States."
"Nor do we consider that the financing of the EU should lead to an increased burden for tax payers."
"- (SV) The EU will be faced with having to make very large financial investments when, in different rounds, ten or more countries from Eastern and Central Europe and from the Baltic region become members."
"Against this background, there is occasion for discussing the EU' s financial requirements if this process is to be managed successfully."
"At present, the EU is not entitled to raise taxes itself, nor, as we see it, should it be entitled to do so in the future either."
"The Haug report does not involve our automatically introducing taxation by the EU, but it opens the door for taxation of this kind, which is bad enough."
"How, then, is the enlargement of the EU to be financed?"
"Yes, the alternative to new income from taxation is still that of reduced costs."
"This will involve better prioritising and concentrating on the major and crucial questions."
"The enlargement of the EU is one such priority."
"As long as almost half the EU' s budget goes on subsidising agriculture and as long as five sixths of it, including the structural funds, goes on subsidies of one kind or another, there can be no doubt that changes still need to be made."
"We have voted against the Haug report."
"We see the report in terms of a desire on the part of the Committee on Budgets to furnish the European Union with its own right of taxation."
"This is in conflict with the general opinion prevalent within the EU and runs counter to the will of the Member States."
"We understand this as another attempt by the European Parliament, characterised as it is by federalist sentiment, to take further powers away from the Member States."
"In connection with Agenda 2000 and in the course of the Berlin Summit, the EU had the chance to implement a reform which would have distributed the financial burdens properly and fairly."
"However, this chance was missed by the EU, which did not wish to carry out adequate and thorough reforms of agricultural policy and of the contributions to the structural funds."
"These are a burden upon most of the expenditure under the EU' s budget."
"To introduce ""autonomous own resources"" as the Committee on Budgets wishes to, would also require the EU to establish its own tax administration."
"This week, the Court of Auditors has reported that at least 40 billion disappeared from the budget last year."
"In light of this, it appears extraordinarily provocative to propose that the EU be given its own right of taxation."
"- (SV) The enlargement of the EU in the direction of Eastern and Central Europe brings the European Union' s financial requirements to the fore."
"The EU is not at present entitled to raise taxes itself, nor should it be entitled to do so in the future either."
"The Haug report does not involve our automatically introducing taxation by the EU, but it opens the way for a debate on the subject."
"Enlargement ought to be financed mainly by means of reduced costs."
"This would involve better prioritising and concentrating on the major and crucial questions."
"The enlargement of the EU is one such priority."
"As long as almost half the EU' s budget goes on subsidising agriculture and as long as five sixths of it, including the structural funds, goes on subsidies of one kind or another, there can be no doubt that changes still need to be made."
"At the Berlin Summit, the Council reached an agreement on the amendment of the own resources decision."
"We agree with the thrust of this decision."
"By maintaining the own resources ceiling at 1.27% of GNP, the Council sustains the necessary budget discipline within the EU."
"Another major bonus resulting from the Berlin Agreement is the attention that was devoted to the unfair distribution of the load over the Member States."
"The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and Austria are the Member States currently contributing a disproportionately large sum in relation to their national income, in order to finance the EU."
"A number of amendments, such as adjusting the financing of the UK rebate and increasing from 10 to 25% the deductions on traditional own resources, reduce the contributions of these Member States to the EU."
"Following a compromise which was reached with great difficulty, we can accept these adjustments, but they are certainly not what you would call attractive."
"At present, they are accommodating the four Member States in question."
"They do not, however, offer structural solutions to the problem of net contributions."
"It would have been better if a solution had been found in the form of a generic correction mechanism, for example, by introducing a band for national contributions to the EU."
"We were unable to back the Haug report because it proposes a number of essential amendments which are incompatible with our convictions."
"The report, for example, advocates rendering the Union less dependent on Member State contributions."
"The rapporteur' s ultimate goal is complete financial autonomy with regard to the Member States."
"We, however, support a continuous involvement of the national parliaments in financing the EU."
"In addition, we voted against the rapporteur' s amendment in which he rejects the increase in the deductions on traditional own resources."
"This puts enormous pressure on the equilibrium of the Berlin Agreement."
"To the Netherlands, which has managed to secure this increase in order to reduce its net payer' s position, this is unacceptable."
"- (NL) In principle, I am of the opinion that the own resources decision should be based on equivalence and fairness between the Member States who all should play according to the same rules."
"This is why I am rather disgruntled about the decisions reached by the European Council of Berlin, with Europe as the big loser."
"The requirement that the Member States should be treated equally should be embodied in the present proposal from the Commission."
"The starting point of the Haug report was that the position of March last, namely that all exemption provisions should be dispensed with, should now be substantiated."
"Amendment 31, part 2, and amendment 32, however, mitigate this position with the addition of the term ""from now on"" ."
"In other words, the Member States can keep what they managed to secure in Berlin for now."
"The purport of Amendments Nos 12 and 33 is to revise the collection costs down to 10% with regard to the amounts established after 31 December 2000, which can be supplemented by a flexible premium as a function of the results achieved by the Member States when collecting the traditional own resources and fraud control measures."
"I agree with this, in principle."
"The Member States must assume responsibility for collecting their traditional own resources."
"What does rather disturb me is the impact that this amendment has on the decisions taken at the European Council of Berlin."
"Berlin was a compromise which managed to accommodate every Member State."
"In order to compensate both Belgium and the Netherlands for the additional cost which ensued from the gradual replacement of the VAT contribution in favour of the GNP contribution, the collection costs were increased to 25%."
"This concession is now cancelled whilst the other benefits are maintained."
"In this way, a new inequality is created to the detriment of two Member States, namely Belgium and the Netherlands."
"As such, I voted against these two amendments."
"- As chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I am duty bound to vote for the amendments from the committee."
"In the committee I voted against those amendments which jeopardised the UK abatement."
"Had I been voting as a Labour backbencher in the plenary I would have voted in a similar way as I did in committee."
"It is my responsibility as chairman to uphold the position of the committee and therefore I voted for the Haug report."
"Averoff report (A5-0055/1999)"
"The Council of Ministers' proposal for a regulation, on which we are to vote today, seeks to implement a number of amendments necessitated by the decision of the European Council of Heads of State and Government in Berlin in March."
"The European Commission is, however, taking advantage of this opportunity to introduce new regulations which represent a new vision of budgetary discipline and which extend its administrative powers, and this is something we cannot accept."
"It has also been proposed that these regulations be henceforth given the legal form of a decision rather than a regulation."
"The French members of our Group are opposed to this amendment of the legal character of the legislation, insofar as a regulation makes it easier to take into account the impact of budgetary discipline on Member States and on Community institutions."
"The Commission' s initial proposal indeed met with unanimous opposition within the Committee on Budgets."
"In the context of the proposal before us there is another aspect which also strengthens the powers given to the European Commission: the possibility of reducing the amount of direct aid or suspending the payment of monthly advances."
"Well, as soon as it is envisaged that the reduced or suspended amounts are to be paid out of the Community budget, in the next financial year at the latest, this intervention will necessarily take the form of yet stricter measures in subsequent years, with the risk of endangering the principles of the common agricultural policy."
"So, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group are opposed to the proposal for a regulation, and also to Mr Averoff' s report."
"To observe the financial ceilings for agricultural policy, stipulated in Agenda 2000, it is necessary that the regulations on budgetary discipline are tightened."
"The draft regulation contains proposals for instruments to intervene if agricultural expenditure threatens to exceed the ceilings."
"For example, in these proposals, the Commission is granted the authority to postpone payments to Member States at the end of the financial year."
"We largely agree with the proposed instruments."
"The rapporteur has drafted an excellent report on this matter."
"He endorses the necessity for more budgetary discipline."
"In addition, the report emphasises, rightly so, that any savings should not affect the principles of the CAP, as they have been approved in Agenda 2000."
"The EU has adopted a policy for the next 7 years which has also raised the necessary expectations within the sector."
"Departures therefrom may not occur without any valid reason."
"Within this framework, we are also in agreement with the amendment which advocates the possibility of transferring unused appropriations to the next financial year."
"This may provide the help we need to find the necessary appropriations within the Agenda 2000 ceiling."
"However, we did not back the amendment in which the agricultural expenditure for accession is kept outside the agricultural guideline for entry purposes."
"There is a wide margin between the agricultural guideline and the financial perspectives for the current Member States."
"This margin could be used for accession in due course."
"Lechner report (A5-0060/1999)"
"- (DA) Out of respect for the Danish reservation in the legal sphere, the Danish Social Democrats have declined to vote in the final vote concerning the Directive."
"The Nordic Green Left (NGL), which consists of the Nordic members of the Group of the European United Left, has today voted in favour of the report concerning the service of legal documents in civil and commercial matters."
"The purpose of the proposal is to ensure the protected and regulated forwarding of legal documents between the Member States' legal authorities, and this is something we can fully support."
"The Nordic Green Left rejects, however, the idea that the proposal should be in the form of a regulation."
"The Nordic Green Left prefers a convention."
"In that way, the proposal would not be directly binding in the Member States, but it would be up to the countries themselves to decide whether they wanted to participate in the convention or not."
"Gebhardt report (A5-0057/1999)"
"- (DA) Out of respect for the Danish reservation in the legal sphere, the Danish Social Democrats have declined to vote in the final vote concerning the Directive."
"The Nordic Green Left (NGL), which consists of the Nordic members of the Group of the European United Left, has today voted in favour of the report concerning the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters concerning the custody of children born of the same parents."
"We have done so because the aim of the proposal is to recognise decisions by the Member States and to protect children' s interests in connection with divorces across national frontiers, and this is something we can fully support."
"The Nordic Green Left rejects, however, the idea that the proposal should be in the form of a regulation."
"The Nordic Green Left prefers a convention."
"In that way, the proposal would not be directly binding in the Member States, but it would be up to the countries themselves to decide whether they wanted to participate in the convention or not."
". Mr President, I welcome all measures designed to reduce pain and suffering in divorce cases, especially when children are involved."
"These Commission proposals help address some of the holes of the Hague Convention, which is badly in need of updating."
"As EU legislation makes it easier for citizens to live and work across Europe, so the number of cross-border marriages, and unfortunately divorces, is increasing too."
"I, like my colleagues, receive an increasing number of letters from constituents asking for help in divorce cases involving partners from different Member States."
"Often there are children involved and a seemingly never-ending custody battle ensues."
"Furthermore, rulings, when made, can often be difficult to enforce."
"Given the current legal jungle, some parents are even driven to break the law and, deplorably, snatch children from their ex-partners."
"These proposals, however, will begin to replace heartbreak with hope."
"By simplifying procedures and making judgements under EU agreements on matrimonial matters legally binding and directly applicable in all Member States, justice will be speeded up and an end brought to such long, drawn-out and heart-rending cases."
"MEPs cannot pretend they can put a stop to the pain caused by separation and divorce, but they can at least try to put a stop to the legal circus that can often accompany it. The welfare of children must come first, not the welfare of lawyers."
"On one occasion during the last parliamentary term, one of my explanations of vote was not approved because I was not in the Chamber."
"It was a question of a written explanation of vote, and the reason for the non-approval was that, if you had explanations of vote to deliver, you should be there in the Chamber, even if the explanations were in writing, so that the President could see that explanations of vote were in fact to be delivered."
"I am taking this matter up because I think it is important that we have some accepted form of procedure in view of what happened in my own case during the last parliamentary term."
"A lot of names have been read out now, you see."
"There are a lot of Members of the European Parliament who very often take part in the votes but always, without fail, make explanations of vote."
"That is why I am wondering: is it necessary to remain in the Chamber so that you can be seen to be there?"
"Or can you proceed in this fairly lax way and continually add a whole lot of texts to the minutes about what you think or do not think?"
"Mr Carlsson, Members normally ask if they can make a written explanation of vote, they confirm it at the end of the vote, and once it has been confirmed, most of them leave the Chamber."
"Your request is, in fact, legitimate, because the Rules of Procedure stipulate that Members who announce they wish to make a written explanation of vote must be present."
"We shall see if we can give you a more precise, written answer to your query."
"Mr President, I made a point of order with regard to the Haug report because the original version is in German and, unfortunately, I do not speak German, and the English version said something quite contradictory to the Portuguese version concerning Amendment No 31."
"Mr President, when you presented the amendment to the vote, you read out ""gross national product"" , in other words, what you read out agrees with the Portuguese version."
"I had to wait until the end of the vote to ask my German colleagues what was in fact written in the German version and they confirmed to me that ""BSP"" means ""gross domestic product"" ."
"This shows in fact that there is a contradiction, which is why I drew your attention to it."
"Given this contradiction, I feel that what you read out, which is ""gross national product"" must be right and not what was written in the original version which is ""gross domestic product"" , which is quite different."
"In these circumstances, I think that this amendment should not be considered valid, given that it was voted on without knowing about the most essential part of this amendment which is this concept of ""GDP"" or ""GNP"" ."
"This is not a mere technical detail but is something that has extraordinarily important financial consequences."
"Mr Casaca, I did indeed read out ""gross national product"" because the Italian version contained the acronym GNP, which means, as I said, gross national product."
"Nevertheless, the services have informed me - and I confirm this information - that the original version, the authoritative version, is the German version, and therefore the versions in the other languages will be brought into line with the German one, with the consequences you pointed out."
"This is the response that I have to give you: the original version, the authoritative version, is the German one."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, there has just been a very significant piece of news: the peace process in Northern Ireland, despite the difficulties which have surrounded it, has taken a step forward today with the decision by the IRA to hold negotiations with the Disarmament Commission."
"The Parliament, which has played an important role in this process, as well as taking pleasure from the developments in Northern Ireland, should involve itself in the efforts to ensure that the other two violent conflicts in the European Union - that in Corsica and, above all, that in the Basque Country - move along the road to a definitive peace."
"I would ask all the groups and Members of this House to assist in this effort towards dialogue so that these peace processes within the Union may reach a positive solution, as so fortunately appears to be the case, at last, in Ireland."
"Thank you, Mr Knörr Borràs. Your statement has been noted."
"Mr President, I also felt you might wish to know of the very welcome development in the Northern Ireland peace process today: the announcement by the IRA that it intends to appoint a representative to coordinate the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons with General John de Chastelain."
"This news is very welcome, as it means that the Good Friday Agreement can be fully implemented and government structures or an executive set up."
"You know that the European Parliament has, over the past twenty years, given every political and financial support to encourage peace in Northern Ireland."
"At last we dare to hope that lasting peace can now be guaranteed democratically."
"Thank you, Mrs Doyle, for bringing Parliament up to date."
"Situation in Chechnya"
"The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the situation in Chechnya."
"Mr President, I was just reflecting for a moment on those points of order. I am sure that Members of Parliament can imagine my own feelings about events in the last forty-eight hours in Northern Ireland."
"I think we have a better chance for peace than has existed for some time and I for one would salute the courage of those parties and party leaders who have made these encouraging developments possible."
"We must all keep our fingers crossed and, where appropriate, perhaps pray."
"To move to the debate: I am extremely pleased to be able to participate in this important debate and I must say that I am very grateful to the business managers for arranging the timing before my departure to the OSCE Summit."
"I hope the House will not regard it as a discourtesy if I am obliged to leave just before the end of the debate but I have to get to Istanbul, not least for a meeting on the Stability Pact."
"The debate provides a useful opportunity for me to inform the House of our most recent contacts with the Russian authorities over events in Chechnya."
"At the same time, I shall be able to participate in the discussions in Istanbul on these issues with a much clearer understanding of the views of the European Parliament."
"I think it is fair to say that there is general consensus in the European Union - the Council, the Parliament and the Commission - on the following two propositions: firstly, whatever the understandable outrage about the appalling acts of terrorism in Moscow, in the northern Caucasus and elsewhere - which, as someone whose country has had all too much experience of terrorism, I totally condemn - Russian action over recent weeks has involved repeated disproportionate military force, repeated disregard for the need to seek a political solution and repeated disregard for the tragic human consequences."
"Secondly, most people (I think this is also true across the European Union) agree that it would be a historic error to begin the next century by locking Russia out of European affairs as we did at the beginning of this century."
"Because we want to avoid repeating the mistakes made after 1917, the European Union has been genuinely seeking a strategic partnership with Russia."
"The concrete proof is the dialogue that we have built up under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the common strategy adopted at the Cologne European Council."
"It is equally obvious that the unfolding situation in Chechnya puts our relations with Russia under considerable strain."
"The Russian authorities must understand that their present action has an impact on their acceptance by the international community and on Russia' s credibility as a political and economic partner."
"They seek to justify their action in terms of domestic public opinion."
"It is the same story when they refuse to give ground on the European Union' s legitimate trade concerns despite the EUR 10 billion trade surplus they now enjoy with us."
"But we live in democratic countries with democratic institutions like this Parliament."
"We too are affected by the strength of public opinion which is understandably horrified by what is happening in Chechnya and worried about simply standing on the sidelines."
"So far, our response has been to try to exert growing diplomatic and political pressure on the Russians."
"We have taken every opportunity to get the message across at all levels."
"I participated in the ministerial troika led by Foreign Minister Halonen in early October."
"The subject dominated the European Union-Russia Summit on 22 October and it dominated our discussion at the General Affairs Council on Monday."
"At each stage the language has been hardened and the operational proposals reinforced."
"The message from the Council this week could not be more clear."
"The European Union has condemned outright all disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya and urged the Russian government to observe its commitments under humanitarian law."
"There is no alternative to seeking a negotiated settlement based on a dialogue with the elected leaders of the northern Caucasus, including Chechnya."
"The Council stressed that imposing a military solution in Chechnya would be a major political mistake."
"What will be the situation in one month, two months, a year or two years from now?"
"There is apparently no long-term Russian strategy to ensure lasting peace."
"More specifically, the Council urged a role for the OSCE and asked that a branch office of the OSCE assistance group to Chechnya should be immediately opened in Nazran and Ingushetia."
"The Council concluded that the Istanbul Summit this Thursday and Friday could be used, inter alia, to drive home these messages to the Russian authorities."
"I am obviously willing to return to Parliament after Istanbul to report on the message we delivered and the reaction we received."
"Increasingly I am being asked whether the European Union should step up the pressure by moving beyond strong words to more direct action."
"What might this involve?"
"Some suggest cutting off financial assistance under the TACIS programme."
"Would this, I ask, put a stop to military action?"
"There would be no direct impact on Russia' s public finances because the money is all channelled through contractors mainly in the European Union."
"But it would undermine the process of economic and social modernisation that we have been pressing for so hard."
"What about suspending food aid?"
"The existing scheme is nearing an end."
"By September over 90% of supplies had already been delivered to Russia."
"It is now for the Russian authorities to ensure distribution."
"The priority for us is to check that the proceeds of the scheme are properly used to repay pension arrears and for other social projects."
"As for the future, we have anyway very grave doubts about the need and the economic rationale for any new food aid schemes."
"Recent events in Chechnya add a strong political argument against meeting any new Russian request for food aid."
"I told Madeline Albright last week that I did not believe that this Parliament would countenance any further delivery of new food aid this winter to Russia."
"There have also been suggestions of withholding IMF assistance and EBRD lending."
"These are obviously issues beyond the direct competence of the European Union, but would it be in our interests to provoke a political backlash against the international community in the run-up to the Duma elections in December?"
"The OSCE meeting in Istanbul provides an opportunity for progress, although I cannot claim to be very optimistic."
"The Russians have made it plain that domestic public opinion is dominating other considerations in their handling of the crisis."
"Our job must be to persuade them their present short-sighted approach will never deliver lasting peace in the Caucasus, and we need to be swift and generous in providing the humanitarian assistance that is so badly needed as winter sets in."
"We will be more effective on both these fronts while channels of communication remain open."
"I am therefore, like the Presidency and the High Representative, in close contact with Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister."
"We met in Helsinki last week in the margins of the Northern Dimension Conference and we have since spoken on the telephone."
"On the urgent humanitarian situation, I have repeatedly stressed the need to ensure adequate access and security for international aid agencies."
"Some progress has been possible through recent assessment missions by outside experts and donors."
"This has allowed a better estimate of the extent of humanitarian aid needs."
"There appear to be up to 200,000 Chechen refugees now in Ingushetia, most of them staying with families there, the remainder living in tents."
"Meanwhile a large number of people are waiting to cross the border and many have returned to Chechnya, either to the area occupied by the Russian military or to that still under control of the Chechen fighters."
"In total, we are talking about up to half a million people to a greater or lesser extent in need of humanitarian assistance."
"The needs of the local population in Ingushetia who have been hosting the refugees must also be taken into account."
"Identifying needs is only one part of the problem."
"The physical delivery of assistance is another."
"Continuing security worries have limited assistance efforts so far."
"From the Commission ECHO has committed close to one million euros to the work of the UNHCR."
"The large-scale assistance urgently required in this region cannot be delivered through remote control with donors excessively dependent on the Russian Ministry for Emergencies."
"We must therefore maintain pressure on the Russian authorities to do much more to facilitate access for international donors and to look after their safety."
"Finally, I should say that Mr Ivanov has suggested in his conversations with me that an intensification of the contacts between the European Parliament and the Duma might be helpful, including perhaps a visit to Moscow by a representative group of your Members."
"Obviously you would want to see for yourselves what was going on and make your own judgements."
"I know that under the admirable leadership of Mrs Krehl, your Delegation for relations with Russia is among the most active in the Parliament, but I would urge you to consider Mr Ivanov' s suggestion seriously."
"The Commission is keen to see a constructive relationship between the Russian Federation and the European Union."
"We have a shared interest in the future security and prosperity of our continent."
"But I have to say that the present crisis in Chechnya is putting a severe strain on the partnership we have been trying to build."
"On the other hand, we all know that it is only by trying to maintain that partnership that we have any chance of getting the Russians to heed our message, that is the awful dilemma that we face."
"The Russians must recognise that they cannot dismiss our concerns out of hand."
"We want closer friendship and understanding but they must recognise that those things are a two-way street."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner Patten has given a very analytical and well considered presentation on this issue."
"We can fully agree with the points he raised."
"This autumn we have followed daily, with growing concern, the continued military action in Chechnya."
"Of particular worry is the fact that the Russian government has still not - despite its promises - begun to look for a political solution to the crisis but, instead, relies solely on military action."
"Moscow' s political goals regarding Chechnya in the longer term are still obscure."
"I appreciate the European Parliament' s interest in the situation in Chechnya."
"I would now briefly like to tell you of our assessment, firstly of the military crisis in Chechnya and, secondly of the humanitarian crisis there."
"Thirdly, I will speak about the action taken thus far by the European Union and the international community, and the aims we have for Chechnya."
"Militarily, Russia controls just under half the Chechen territory, and is advancing systematically."
"On Friday last week, Russia took the city of Gudermes and may also in time take Grozny."
"Russia' s apparent aim is to bring the whole of Chechnya back under Russian control."
"For Prime Minister Putin, the war has also so far been an internal political success."
"During the autumn the European Union has repeated its concern regarding the disproportionate use of force in Chechnya."
"This has caused a number of civilian victims and an ever-continuing increase in the number of internal refugees."
"The use of force against civilians is prohibited under international humanitarian law."
"Through its action, Russia is in violation of the Geneva Convention and the Additional Protocol."
"Indiscriminate bombing has been responsible for many civilian victims."
"The European Union has underlined the need for rapid de-escalation of the conflict and urged Russia to commence negotiations for a lasting solution to the problem."
"It is clear that a basically political conflict cannot be solved militarily."
"Mr Sasi, I must interrupt the proceedings for a few moments in order to check whether or not there is some reason for the alarm which we can hear."
"(The sitting was suspended at 3.20 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.)"
"Mr Sasi, please excuse us for this technical hitch, and please continue your statement on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr Sasi, Commissioner, it is with relief that my fellow Members and myself welcomed the statement from the European Union' s Foreign Affairs Council the day before yesterday, forcefully condemning the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya."
"It is with relief that we heard this morning the very firm position adopted on the matter by Mr Solana and his undertaking to bring his weight to bear, as of this afternoon in Istanbul, in order to ensure that international law and human dignity is respected in this part of the world, and it is with relief that we have just heard you tell us, Mr Patten, that you are shortly to add your contribution to that of Mr Solana in this area."
"We were, in fact, in the majority in this House in condemning the methods adopted by the Russian army to quash under fire any sort of potential resistance to its advance without taking into consideration the losses thereby caused among the civilian population."
"We were also in the majority in deploring, together with the majority of public opinion in Europe, the striking contrast between the din of the bombing and the sustained silence of the governments of the European Union."
"I can bear witness to this because yesterday, I chaired a meeting of all the groups of this Parliament where a draft joint resolution was finalised which, unlike others, will not be a compromise text and will in no way be a compromise between divergent positions, but will indeed be a synthesis enriched by the proposals of each of the political families united in a common desire to offer Parliament' s contribution to a political solution of the tragic situation currently causing bloodshed in Chechnya."
"In this resolution, which I have no doubt will be massively supported by my fellow Members, we are adding our voices to those of the Council in condemning the action currently being taken and in requesting that negotiations are initiated directly with the elected representatives of the population of Chechnya."
"Together with you, we are requesting that the necessary humanitarian aid be deployed immediately, in order to provide assistance to the hundreds of thousands of people displaced due to this conflict, but we are requesting, Mr Patten, that provision is made for the suspension of economic aid to Russia, initially, if Russia continues with its indiscriminate attacks upon the civilian population and does not seek a negotiated settlement."
"I fully understand, and we hope with all our hearts that the task of negotiation which you are going to enter into, together with Mr Solana, will be successful."
"We also propose, and we are agreed upon this, I am sure, that a conference should be held, and that Parliament should participate in this conference."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the stand taken by Mr Patten and Mr Sasi and compliment Mr Morillon, Mr Cohn-Bendit and others on this very strong motion we put together yesterday."
"It is important to underline what we say in the motion for a resolution, namely that we are committed to strengthening the partnership with Russia because we realise that there will be no stable, peaceful Europe without a stable and democratic Russia."
"We also underline the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation."
"But it is the strategic partnership agreement that also gives us formal grounds, apart from our reactions as human beings, to question what is going on."
"The Tacis agreement states specifically that Tacis assistance is provided on the basis of certain shared economic and political values and practices."
"This is why we have also raised the issue of Tacis here."
"We do it against the background that some weeks ago the Russian Duma gave Mr Putin an increase of USD 1 billion for the war effort in Chechnya."
"Therefore we also demand the highest degree of transparency on the part of any financial institutions or donors of funds to Russia."
"We also urge the Council and the Commission to consider freezing all new contracts under the Tacis programme, except the democracy line."
"This is a warning."
"We are not only concerned about the question of Chechnya; we are outraged, horrified."
"We want to add our voice and express our strong concern about what is going on and use the weight we have in Parliament, which we can do, among other things, through the Tacis programme."
"Mr President, the stand on Chechnya drafted by the political groups of the European Parliament is, in my opinion, well prepared."
"The clear basis of the resolution is the support for Russian territorial integrity."
"The Russian government is also supported to the extent that we condemn terrorism in all its forms."
"On the other hand, we also condemn the excessive use of force and we are calling for a political solution to be sought for the Chechen question."
"In addition, we wish to emphasise that the civilian population must be protected and the refugees taken good care of."
"Our position complies with the resolutions we adopted earlier and it is also in harmony with the policy pursued by Western countries."
"On the other hand, the line adopted by Parliament apparently contradicts public opinion among the citizens of the Member States."
"The European Parliament' s policy on Chechnya is encumbered by the fact that Western countries have themselves acted in such a way that they have lost the moral authority to clearly condemn the blunders Russia is presently accused of."
"This is shown, for example, in the article by Prime Minister Putin, recently published in the Herald Tribune, in which he defends his government' s action with reference to examples offered by Western countries."
"The particular burden that the West bears now is the war against Yugoslavia."
"The bombing began without sufficient consideration being given to the objectives and consequences."
"In Kosovo a war of independence was going on, associated with violence against the civilian population."
"The West interposed in this war with a bombing campaign against one side, and on behalf of the other, although they had not approved the objectives of the side on behalf of which they had started the war."
"As no one wanted or was able to use ground troops in the war, the bombing meant that a humanitarian and political crisis became a humanitarian and political catastrophe."
"If Western policy were consistent, these countries would now be considering the defence of Chechnya, even through military means, but nobody even thinks about it."
"Now it is considered that Russia has the right to defend its own country' s unity, even through the use of very harsh measures."
"On the other hand, Russia is now appealing to the notion that it has the right to use military force to achieve its own important political aims in the same way as Western countries did in Yugoslavia."
"Despite our own moral burden, the European Union must use all its authority to solve the Chechen crisis according to the guidelines the representatives of the Council and the Commission have laid down here."
"As we develop a common foreign, security and defence policy for the Union, we must see to it that it has a sound moral basis."
"Only in that way will we have the authority to insist that others should act in accordance with these principles."
"Mr President, Russian tanks are currently crushing a nation, just as they already crushed and attempted to crush the people of Hungary in 1956, of Germany in 1963, and we can give other examples, up to Prague in 1968."
"Let us forget the hypocrisy and the double talk."
"The Russian policy being carried out in Chechnya is an old tactic."
"It is founded upon the Stalinist policy which shoved whole populations behind the Urals, without the right to return home, twenty or thirty years ago."
"And if we say that we do not wish to exclude Russia from Europe, that is true."
"But when the Russians say that this is an internal problem, we must tell them that today we all live in the same world, with shared values."
"And it is in the name of such values that we declare that we have an entitlement to political intervention, humanitarian intervention, in the face of this Russian barbarism."
"Yes, there has been terrorism."
"But who committed these acts of terrorism in Moscow?"
"Do we know?"
"Russian history claimed that Katyn was an atrocity committed by the Germans, until it was discovered that it was in fact committed by the Russians."
"I do not know who committed the terrible criminal acts in Russia, but I do know that the women and children of Chechnya who are being massacred today surely did not commit acts of terrorism."
"This is why, when we Europeans say that we are freezing aid to Russia, it is not with the intention of excluding Russia, but of integrating it into a shared system of values."
"Let us not give in to the blackmail which says ""if we do not help Yeltsin or Putin, then we will have worse"", for what could be worse than the annihilation of Grozny and the annihilation of Chechnya?"
"Do you think that Mr Lebed or any other crazy man would do something other than this?"
"This is why I am asking the Council and the Commission to be honest in saying to the Russians that if they do not change their policy, then we shall change our aid policy."
"Obviously, we shall provide the Russians with food aid, but we shall not assist a government which looks just like the old Russian Government."
"The fact is, Mr Putin looks just like all the members and chairmen of the KGB."
"I wished to say this in the presence of Mr Armatov, the Chechen Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will have, as he listens to us, an idea of what democracy in Europe is."
"Mr President, I am extremely worried that worldwide there are increasing attempts to resolve conflicts using military means."
"Russia is no exception in this, which is particularly painful for the European Left; it is acting as it sees fit and no differently from NATO in Yugoslavia. I consider the applause which you gave Mr Solana this morning and now the applause for the speech made by Mr Cohn-Bendit to be opportunism of the worst kind."
"I simply must say this!"
"To reverse the trend, that is away from the military and towards conflict prevention and peaceful conflict settlement, is the crucial challenge facing this European Parliament."
"We have logically assessed the war in Chechnya and we have also deferred our decision on further expansion of cooperation with Russia."
"We expect the same of the Council."
"Yesterday' s declaration by the Council is a positive sign but it is too late."
"It is to be hoped that the Council does not need as long to follow up our proposal to freeze the expansion of relations and the TACIS programmes for Russia until such time as the weapons finally fall silent."
"The attacks on refugees and residential areas, the closing of the borders and the hindrance of international aid organisations providing humanitarian aid not only contravene the Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians in war zones and other international obligations but are quite simply inhuman and totally unacceptable."
"I consider it self-evident and indispensable that the European Union increase its humanitarian aid for the people of this region."
"However, we must not release Russia from its responsibility to protect and provide for refugees and itself to care for the people in the war zone."
"The same also applies for the reconstruction of the country."
"Mr President, discussing Chechnya today reminds us of Kosovo and makes us wonder about that famous duty to interfere on humanitarian grounds, that principle which is, unfortunately, as vague as it is noble."
"Indeed, it is used with excessive discretionary power, often owing to specific political or economic interests."
"The principle of humanitarian intervention has, until now, failed miserably because Milosevic' s regime is still firmly in power in a country that has gone backwards in time and economics by at least thirty years, while the majority of the Albanian people have returned to their land and 10% of Kosovar Serbs and all the gypsy peoples have been forced into exile."
"In Chechnya, the situation is even worse."
"Two months ago, the Russian army entered Chechnya, a land which had already been destroyed in human and economic terms and drained three years ago with more than 100,000 dead."
"Today, we hear of the civilian population being shelled, which has caused over 3,000 deaths and turned 200,000 people into refugees."
"And all of this while the so-called ""virtuous"" international community justifies the Russian intervention on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and the International Monetary Fund bankrolls unsecured funds to Yeltsin, despite the billions of dollars misappropriated by the Russian authorities."
"It is true that Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation, but the Russian troops do not have the authority to legally massacre men, women and children."
"The international community, our Union, is duty-bound, if it is truly committed to safeguarding human rights, not to remain passive."
"The region has been ravaged by war and, in the meantime, the European Union is increasing its commitment to humanitarian aid and funding for the TRASECA project to link the Black Sea and Central Asia."
"And the fuel factor - gas and oil - has played an important part in the Chechen crisis."
"American companies are interested in Caspian Sea oil as an alternative to Persian Gulf oil."
"They asked the Department of State to draw up a strategic map of possible routes: the most important would be the section between the Caspian Sea and the Turkish port of Ceyhan, which affects the route between Baku and the Russian port of Novorossisk."
"Thus, in 1994, the Russian army intervened to show that Russia controlled the operational oil pipelines allowing the Caspian Sea production to be exported so it would not risk being excluded from the power play dominated by America."
"The Union must have one single objective: to contribute to re-establishing peace, to find a new status for Chechnya, as laid down in the agreement signed between Russia and Chechnya on 31 August 1996, and it must also remember that if Europe wants to defend human rights, it cannot continue to endorse the fact that Russia believes force and the army to be the only political tools."
"Mr President, why is President Yeltsin now repeating what he once described as the biggest blunder of his political career of 1994/1996: a large-scale military intervention in Chechnya?"
"And why does the Russian military apparatus provoke the Trans-Caucasian republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan by making wild accusations regarding cooperation with Chechen ""separatists and terrorists"" ?"
"Both operations are pretty disastrous anyway, both for the Russian Federation and the Caucasus."
"Under the quasi-legitimate banner of ""fighting terrorism and violent separatism"" , the Kremlin is itself terrorising the Chechen people and is stimulating the very terrorist, fundamentalist elements amongst them."
"It is likely that the Russian punitive expedition in Chechnya is largely founded on internal political and military motives other than the purging of ""Chechen Wahabi headhunters"" ."
"To the fraudulent ""family"" of President Yeltsin, this is a true gift by way of a diversionary tactic."
"At the same time, the deeply aggrieved Russian army leadership can undertake bloody revenge for the humiliating defeat against the Chechen freedom fighters of only a few years ago."
"Moreover, the horrifying war scene in the Caucasus offers the average Russian politician the chance par excellence to beat the popular national drum, especially in the run-up to the Duma elections."
"The trouble-stirring from Moscow in the Caucasus is undoubtedly the result of the competitive rivalry with the West regarding the energy treasures of the Caspian Basin and is indicative of a revival of the imperial idea."
"In this light, the Chechen tragedy is merely the overture for a larger, regional crisis."
"Does Moscow have as little to fear from the West, including the European Union, now, as it did during the first, degrading showdown with Grozny?"
"Why not block all credit to Russia, for example?!"
"Mr President, just as the previous speaker stated, the last few weeks have shown that the actual scale of things in the Caucasus is considerably greater and also encompasses the entire Caspian Sea."
"Of course, in the current phase of the war in and around Chechnya we need to see damage limitation as the most important issue and to provide the swiftest possible emergency aid for the population."
"However, whilst the real interests in the Caucasus are not openly declared and remain undisclosed the attempts at resolution will not work."
"Each person interprets the causes of the war using the arguments which best suit his own theory."
"There is no admission that this area is one of the largest stores of raw materials in the world and that many multinational interests are focused on this area."
"So long as greed for these possessions and for the resources in this area remains unconquered - and this applies equally to Europe and many other states - the conflicts in this region will not be resolved and, long term, we also have to consider finding a major, comprehensive solution to this problem."
"Mr President, I cannot share the opinion of Mr Väyrynen that this Parliament does not have enough credibility."
"Two months ago we took up a clear position as a single international institution, albeit not every individual in the House."
"I am pleased that everyone has now come on board and that the Council and Commission also now support what we in this House clearly declared on this matter with a small majority two months ago."
"However, we have now moved on considerably, having come to realise that it is not enough to direct threatening words at the Russians."
"Rather, we must reach conclusions."
"We must stop financing this war, which is a bloody, colonial war for oil and an especially bloody form of electoral campaigning."
"This means, Commissioner, that we must stop financial payments, including TACIS funds."
"On the other hand, we must clearly say to our partner that, as far as we are concerned, a partner is no longer a partner when he becomes a murderer."
"This should also be obvious between states."
"I would also like to clear up a few myths."
"No mention is ever made of the democratically elected government of Chechnya."
"This is not another internal affair for Russia."
"This government was elected under the supervision of the OSCE on the basis of a cease-fire agreement which the OSCE brokered."
"We must resolutely support this government against the breach of this agreement by Moscow, which is a contravention of international law and which has come about as a result of the fact that Moscow has restored a KGB puppet parliament, which was in place in Moscow before the agreement, in order to have a comfortable negotiating partner."
"We must also clear up the myth that this is a response to terrorism."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit is right: we do not know who carried out the bomb attacks in Moscow, which we condemn."
"Much points to bogus machinations."
"We must state quite clearly that anyone dropping bombs on civilians is not fighting terrorists; rather he is inciting terrorists by traumatising whole generations which will suffer the consequences of this particularly brutal form of colonialism."
"We therefore need a wholly clear and energetic policy and not the assertions of alibis which we have had in recent months, including from our governments."
"I would like to urge the Council and the Commission to use the same clear language at tomorrow' s OSCE Summit as the European Parliament has used in its resolution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have had the opportunity in the last few days to speak both with the Russians, in the person of Mr Rishkov from the Duma, and with Mr Achmadov from the Chechens."
"The overall picture which emerges is incredibly complicated."
"The Russians want to successfully conclude this military intervention using full force, whatever it costs."
"They deny that there are civilian fatalities."
"They say that the Chechen refugees, more than 300,000, are not facing a difficult situation. More and more, Russian politicians are using the Chechen conflict as an instrument of electoral campaign; and with some success."
"95% of the Russian population support the war in Chechnya."
"However, it is also true that Russia is claiming in principle that the entire Chechen population are terrorists and as a European Parliament we cannot and must not accept this."
"We therefore demand political dialogue and a political solution and commit ourselves to the means of pressure we have at our disposal, even the blocking of new TACIS projects or the refusal to provide food aid to Russia."
"Humanitarian aid yes, democratic projects yes, but nothing more!"
"Even though we acknowledge that the debate and negotiations on Russian non-compliance with trade agreements and the steel agreement will then become extremely difficult for the European Union, terrorism cannot, and must not, be waged against an entire population using military might."
"In this regard, an entirely different discussion, indeed an entirely different issue comes to the fore: The European Parliament has always made it clear in all its resolutions that Chechnya is a part of the Russian Federation."
"I cannot quite understand therefore how an appointed Chechen Foreign Minister who, under international law, should not even exist, can hold an official discussion with the President of the European Parliament."
"I consider this to be an extremely difficult decision."
"I agree that the groups should have access to information, and I was very grateful that I was able to speak on this matter with Mr Achmadov, but in the past there have not been official appointments of this type in this House."
"This is a very unusual occurrence."
"Mr President, through the disgraceful policies being pursued today in Chechnya, the Russian Government is rigidly following the example set by the governments of the United States and of the Member States of the European Union just a few months back."
"It is continuing to use excessive violence and to bomb civilians, both indiscriminately and with impunity, because it has neither the patience nor the stamina to find a political solution to the existing problems."
"Just as the others did!"
"We are not convinced by the criticism being levelled at them either."
"We are even less convinced by you saying that you cannot safeguard the rights of minorities in Kosovo, and that you cannot guarantee the integrity of Yugoslavia."
"How will you go about convincing Russia that you can guarantee its integrity and how will you persuade it to respect human rights?"
"The whole thing is a shambles, blind hypocrisy."
"Only those who uphold the rights and respect the integrity of the states of both the Yugoslavian and Russian Federations can convince us of the rights of those persecuted Chechens who are suffering greatly today."
"Only them! Nobody else!"
"Mr President, I would like to add just two points to the comments made by Mr Morillon, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mr Posselt and Mr Schori, which I completely endorse."
"We should remember that the Soviet Union of the time stirred up the processes of decolonisation, even when it was not always clear that the populations concerned actually wanted decolonisation."
"Today, then, we are facing an empire, the only one, which has saved on the expense of decolonisation."
"Historically, there is no doubt that the Russian Empire in fact colonised a large part of the Caucasus, i.e. non- Russian peoples."
"This is the first thing."
"I say this as a Federalist, and as somewhat not in favour of the multiplication of states."
"In the second place, and I am addressing Mr Patten and the Council in particular, the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, have a policy in the Caucasus, the region which Chechnya is part of."
"It must, as a matter of urgency, have a policy which guarantees stability, not only for Chechnya, but also for Chechnya in relation to Georgia, in relation to Azerbaijan, in relation to Armenia."
"We know the problems there are particularly in this last country."
"It follows that a real European policy is urgently needed in this region."
"Mr President, the Russian government will be tempted to draw parallels between our action against Serbia to end the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and their action against Chechen crime."
"This is strangely voiced at the extreme left of this Parliament."
"I personally think that this comparison is rather far-fetched, but it is useful to remind ourselves of the discrepancies."
"Our action and that of NATO in Kosovo and Serbia was undertaken with an extremely selective application of the least possible violence, sparing the civilian population as much as possible."
"Therein lies the huge difference between our action and the action Russia is taking in Chechnya at the moment."
"It is useful that the extreme left should remind us of this difference, although quite unintended."
"Also, human life appears to be of no consequence and refugees are of no concern. Long lines of refugees are kept waiting at the border and international aid organisations fail to offer real help due to a lack of cooperation."
"This is another clear difference and it is really good that the extreme left have underscored these huge differences between Russia' s action in Chechnya and that of NATO in Kosovo."
"Mr President, it is essential that clear-cut measures be taken and that we give the Russian population some sort of message."
"Indeed, we received the delegation from the Russian Parliament here and we noticed that there is, in fact, a common opinion amongst the Russian representatives there and they were not all from the same party."
"This stood out to us."
"We will have therefore have to give the Russian population a message which is loud and clear so that they might start to question the events in Chechnya and their government' s action."
"I am sure we will need to bring some pressure to bear in Russia if we are to put an end to these Russian crimes once again."
"This is why I think, following on from what Mr Patten said during his hearing, that it is bad doing business with states which violate human rights on a massive scale - he was talking about China in response to a question raised by us - and that it is in fact beneficial to consider financial-economic measures when it comes to giving a clear message."
"We may be able to call on our friends from the Council of Europe too to consider a suspension."
"Mr President, I think we as a Parliament should take a clear stance and express our support for the Chechen population and, for this reason, it is important to my mind that the President of the European Parliament meet the Chechen Foreign Minister in order to explain our stance."
"Mr President, I do not need to repeat what the Commission and the Council have said on the situation in Chechnya."
"I would just like to emphasise one area which can serve as a justification for our joint resolution on Chechnya: the suffering of the civilian population; the hundreds of fatalities; the 200,000 refugees and their plight given the onset of winter; the overreaction of the Russian government and the indiscriminate bombing of the civilian population."
"I have the impression that this is not a legitimate war against terrorist activity, but a political power struggle at the cost of the population."
"For this reason our Parliament must clearly say what it wants and what it doesn' t want."
"I shall summarise: firstly, we are not disputing the right of the Russian government to fight the brutal terrorism in Dagestan."
"Secondly, we in no way wish to jeopardise the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation."
"Thirdly, however, we cannot condone aeroplanes bombing the civilian population!"
"I condemn these bombings, just as months ago I condemned the bombings of Novi Sad, Belgrade and Nis, which were described as ""collateral damage"" ."
"Mr President, what we are experiencing in the second Chechen war is a double tragedy, firstly because the Chechen people are the victims and secondly because the current Russian policy in the Caucasus will not lead to a solution to the problems, but will only aggravate them."
"We are witnessing a destabilisation of the region which will have long-term consequences."
"Today, so I have heard, a Georgian village is reported to have been bombed by Russian planes."
"This means that there is a danger that this conflict will not remain a purely Russian conflict, but will perhaps extend beyond the Russian borders."
"This would then undoubtedly be a problem and a further matter for the world community and, of course, the European Union to deal with."
"I believe that in recent plenary part-sessions since the summer, this Parliament has tackled the problem of the second Chechen war in great detail, as indeed it has had to."
"We have taken up a very clear position."
"We will also, by the mutual consent of all groups, take up a position in the resolution before us today."
"This is necessary and right!"
"However, I also share the view of Commissioner Patten that we must not in any way end communication with the Russians."
"If we want to persuade, if we want to exert influence, then this can only be done by intensifying discussions with our Russian partners."
"We were visited last week, as Mr Oostlander previously stated, by a Russian parliamentary delegation."
"I can only say, and this is the major problem with this second Chechen war, that contrary to the first Chechen war the Russian parties in the Duma are nearly all united and, unfortunately, support the policy of the Putin government."
"This makes it perfectly clear how important dialogue is and what we need to do."
"I think that the idea which was put forward here of possibly improving contact with the Russian Parliament through an ad-hoc delegation is an important one."
"And I also think that, since the Russians have asked us to act as electoral supervisors in the elections to the Duma, we must seriously consider whether to satisfy this request from the Parliament because this might be a further contribution to dialogue and to the development of more democracy and perhaps also better politics in Russia."
"Mr President, the situation regarding the refugees is intolerable, and it is not Russia' s internal affair."
"Russia is creating a massive humanitarian catastrophe with its action against soldiers and terrorists that have carried out inhumane deeds."
"However, we must remember that nobody has mentioned here that a separate Muslim state was being created between the Caspian and Black Seas."
"That is a much larger issue, and one we have to bear in mind."
"Cutting ourselves off from Russia prior to the elections would be very unwise, as we want to lend our support to Russia' s democratic strengths."
"When we cut ourselves off before, it led to Stalinism and dictatorship."
"I support the idea of a visit to Moscow in December, in connection with the elections, as I have proposed, and that we press for a pan-Caucasus peace conference to solve other problems apart from this particular one, as there are military operations going on in half a dozen states in the Caucasus, and the threat of the operations spreading is quite apparent."
"Mr President, I am wondering whether these documents are morally right, especially as I think they are rather useless."
"The documents on the Caucasus and Chechnya contain the same elements found in the Council of Europe' s document that was dismissed two weeks ago."
"It therefore appears to be a mandatory exercise in rhetoric, with the usual array of fine principles and high hopes."
"The European Union expresses its concerns, stresses this and admonishes that, requests a dialogue that it knows is impossible and limits itself to condemning - and this is the first point I would like to talk about - just one thing: the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of force in Chechnya."
"So you could say then, that a little bit of war is alright, as long as it is not disproportionate."
"But tell me, what is a disproportionate war?"
"The second point is the following: the bombing strategy following NATO' s example is supposedly a response to the terrorist bombs in various Russian cities."
"Is there any evidence, are there any suspicions that these bombs were planted by Chechens?"
"What investigation confirms this?"
"Is it reasonable to kill thousands of people and turn 200,000 people into refugees based on a mere suspicion of guilt?"
"The European Union is asking for a negotiated solution - and if anyone really believes in the possibility of negotiations they are living in cloud cuckoo land - while the Russians in the Caucasus are making a distinction between the bad guys - those who are asking for independence - perhaps making them out to be Muslims, and the good guys, or rather only those people who are collaborating with them."
"So where is the dialogue?"
"I must notify the House that Commissioner Patten has had to leave us in order to catch his flight to Istanbul in order to attend the OSCE meeting, as scheduled."
"I am therefore going to give the floor to the Council in order to conclude the statements which, I am sure, will be followed with a great deal of interest by the citizens of Chechnya who are today present in the visitors' gallery."
"Mr President, we have had an excellent debate on this matter here in Parliament."
"In my opinion, Parliament' s concern is the right message the Union has to send out."
"All of us, the Commission, the Council and Parliament agree on this situation."
"It is important that we all send Russia a signal, and a clear one at that, that violence perpetrated against the civilian population must stop, that talks with legally elected representatives in Chechnya must commence, that humanitarian aid is needed, and that its access to the region must be allowed, with the OSCE having the main role to play in finding a solution to the crisis."
"I can assure you that the Presidency of the Council will act with determination to achieve these aims."
"At the same time I wish Commissioner Patten success in the talks at Istanbul."
"Mr President, I should just like to ask you to convey our thanks to the President of Parliament for receiving the representative of a government elected under the supervision of the OSCE who is also established in the area of the Council of Europe and who was elected under the Russian constitution."
"Your statement has been noted, Mr Posselt."
"I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m."
"WTO Millennium Round (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0062/1999) by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The EU Approach to the WTO Millennium Round (COM(1999)331 - C5-0155/1999 - 1999/2149(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that the need to develop trade as effectively as possible and the new challenges posed by globalisation, as well as the need to consolidate a balanced commercial system which will contribute to sustainable development and whose benefits will also extend to the less developed countries, require a strengthening of the rules which govern international trade."
"Hence the importance of the coming conference in Seattle and the timeliness and suitability of the proposals in the Commission' s communication as regards the upcoming negotiations."
"In fact, given the challenges before us, it is clear that the next Round cannot be limited to simply widening the regulatory framework, however important that may be, nor must it only ensure that trade liberalisation contributes to economic and social growth in the less developed countries, although I share fully in that desire. Rather, it must also establish rules which will lead to the opening up of markets and guarantee compliance with them."
"We have to bear in mind that for European industry - and I am thinking in particular of the textile sector - access to the markets of the developed countries and emerging economies on reciprocal terms is a fundamental priority."
"To this end it is essential that the Commission achieves the harmonisation of tariffs and the elimination of tariff peaks and tariff progression, as well as the removal of all technical barriers to trade, on the understanding that the less developed countries should be guaranteed free access to the international market for all their products so that they can also benefit from trade liberalisation."
"And now, Commissioner, I would like to ask you firstly if you can confirm your intention not to accept, on the agenda of the negotiations, any reconsideration of the agreement on the textile sector as regards the clothing industry and, secondly, how you consider that China' s membership of the World Trade Organisation will affect the European textile industry, bearing in mind that that country is the world' s foremost exporter of textile products."
"Finally, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report and his desire to reach the widest possible consensus on a subject as important as the coming Millennium Round, which we depend on to consolidate a balanced trading system which will ensure, on a global level, an economic order based on social justice."
"Mr President, Mr Lamy, this morning the President-in-Office of the Council reminded us of the importance of the agriculture portfolio in the WTO negotiations, and I thank him for this."
"You already know that farmers in Europe are going to have to make great efforts to adapt in order to apply the Berlin compromise which, last March, represented the acceptable balance for the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"You know that developing countries must be able to count on Europe in order to guarantee the legitimate rapid expansion of their own agriculture which is often the major sector in their economic development."
"You know that the United States is demonstrating today that the market alone finds it difficult to guarantee agricultural revenue."
"You must also know, then, that we are counting specifically on you to ensure that the WTO negotiations result in the outcome that we expect."
"Regarding access to the market, how is it possible not to recognise that Europe is not the well-defended fortress that it is unjustly accused of being, since we are the leading importer worldwide with a deficit trade balance in the food processing sector?"
"This reality, Commissioner, must make it possible for you to campaign so that markets are opened up and tariff barriers are reduced according to gradual processes, varying according to sector."
"As for market protection mechanisms, if they must be adjusted, should they not be retained or reinforced for particular countries, and I refer to developing countries in particular?"
"Regarding internal support, how is it possible not to make the most of the fact that Agenda 2000 is leading to a significant reduction in the overall extent of support, at a time when the United States are adopting a policy which goes in the opposite direction?"
"This situation must make it possible for you to ensure that the blue box and the green box accepted at Marrakech are retained, and that the peace clause is renewed."
"Regarding export subsidies, how is it possible not to capitalise on the strategy of reduction which we are undertaking with the new common agricultural policy?"
"This development must give you the possibility of demanding transparency and handling of the various forms of export aid used by our competitors."
"Commissioner, the Berlin Agreement was drawn up in order to give the European Union real room for manoeuvre in the Millennium Round."
"We have no doubt that you will be able to make use of this by building on the concept of multi-functionality which makes it possible to meet the various expectations of our societies as regards food quality, employment and sustainable rural development, the protection and conservation of the natural heritage and also regarding the balance between regions."
"This approach must afford Europe the opportunity to be open to interesting possibilities of alliance."
"This is why we are counting on you to take the offensive in these negotiations, in which you may count on our critical support."
"Mr President, I shall very briefly set out the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party' s points of view on agriculture in anticipation of the World Trade Organisation negotiations."
"The fact is that it is an increase in demand on the world market which is the most reliable guarantee of profitable European agriculture in the future."
"It is a much more reliable guarantee than stubborn persistence with our own protective system."
"Moreover, it is a liberalisation of world trade and improved competition which can lead to increased growth in the new industrialised countries and in populous developing countries."
"It is this which can mobilise the world' s huge need for food and convert it into a level of demand with great purchasing power."
"Naturally, we shall retain the European model."
"We shall take account, perhaps to a still greater extent, of the environment, public health, animal protection and multi-functionality - that is to say diversity - in the countryside and in agriculture."
"I think it is this and an open-minded attitude to the development of the information society which will be priorities in discussing the future shape of Europe."
"It is important, and a responsibility on our part, to pursue the questions of increased growth throughout the world in the World Trade Organisation negotiations."
"That is why I think that it is so important to say that demand is a more important consideration than the particular system we have here at home."
"Mr President, Mr Schwaiger, true, your report is very comprehensive, but it is rather too non-committal, and there are a number of points it fails to address."
"What, for example, has come of the demand for an analysis of the WTO' s influence so far upon, for example, developing countries, the environment, the EU and existing treaties before we get into the next round of negotiations?"
"To say, Commissioner Lamy, that there were no tools or methods for doing this and that these would first have had to be developed is simply laughable."
"In revising the uniquely constituted Lomé Conventions, the refrain is always that that these ought not to remain in that form and that they are not WTO specific."
"What we should be demanding, however, is that the ground rules governing world trade must be focused upon the needs of people here in Europe and in developing countries."
"They must be enlisted in the service of sustainability and of social needs and not of the interests of corporations and their shareholders."
"This must be the main requirement and not a new round of liberalisation which serves only to incite people worldwide to compete for the lowest wages under the worst social and ecological conditions."
"In our opinion, the WTO needs to be fundamentally reformed before there are any further negotiations at all."
"Our goal must be nothing less than a fairer and socially and ecologically more responsible form of world trade which honours the interdependence of nations."
"Mr President, on the eve of the Seattle Conference, I still think it unfortunate that we are going into a fresh round of negotiations before making a serious assessment of the one before."
"The fact that millions of individuals are affected by the consequences of the decisions which are to be taken there does, however, make this necessary."
"Those in favour of the liberalisation of trade as the driving force for prosperity are all the less willing to undertake such a report, since there can be no real denial that the situation has become worse in recent years, and inequalities between underdeveloped countries and advanced countries, as well as the development of inequalities even within developed countries, have intensified."
"When wealth is concentrated at one extreme and there is an increase in unemployment at the other, one may well wonder if the WTO has not primarily served to institutionalise the law of the jungle."
"As a matter of urgency, a new concept of trade between nations must be promoted, based on solidarity, cooperation, democracy and the promotion of employment and social rights."
"However, so that all of this does not simply remain a vain hope, decisions must be taken, I believe, in three areas."
"Firstly, formalise the principle whereby these negotiations must be of use to disadvantaged countries and populations, affirming the right of the European Union and the Member States to defend their development policy and specific agreements with the ACP and the refusal to let the Lomé Conventions be challenged by the WTO."
"Secondly, insist on the primacy of the interests of peoples in preference to commercial and financial criteria."
"I have three proposals relating to this. Of course, they are not comprehensive."
"Firstly, subject WTO regulations to the international charter and conventions governing matters of human rights and social, health and environmental issues."
"In saying this, I am thinking of Kyoto, Peking and Copenhagen."
"Next, refuse to continue to liberalise services and, on the contrary, assist the development of cooperation of public services in education, health and transport."
"Finally, maintain the principle of cultural exception, affording the European Union and the Member States the possibility of preserving their capability of freely determining their audiovisual cultural policy in the name of development of a thriving and enriching diversity."
"One more proposal: establish the precautionary principle for the environment, health and food safety as an absolute priority."
"Finally, the third area. Radical democratisation of the structures of the WTO is essential."
"There must be democratic supervision of the negotiations and of the implementation of agreements."
"The presence of NGOs, representatives of society and of trade unions, with the status of observers, must be accepted in these negotiations."
"What is more, all the points negotiated at the WTO must be ratified by the European Parliament and by national parliaments."
"Today the WTO itself is decreeing the laws, monitoring their application, and settling disputes."
"I think it is not possible to be both judge and judged."
"The dispute settlement body must be radically modified."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very objective report."
"In the short time available, I want to add my voice to that of those in this Parliament who insist on greater protection of Europe' s vital interests in the forthcoming world trade talks."
"We in this House have put our cards on the table in the Agenda 2000 agreement and must not allow or accept any dilution of that agreement by the United States of America."
"I say that in particular from an agricultural perspective."
"Part of the motivation behind Agenda 2000 is to conform in a credible way with world trade rules and in the process, of course, to make Europe a key player in world trade - and the Americans will not want that."
"We enter this new round of talks with the benefits of hindsight and in the knowledge that the United States, in reaching its negotiating position, will have, as in the past, researched the hidden agenda of establishing ways to deviate from that agreement to help its own producers, while at the same time demanding that Europe adhere rigidly to its requirements."
"In this House we have prioritised consumer protection, established the family farm as the agricultural model and the basic unit of production, and made rural development and the preservation of rural communities the second pillar of CAP reform."
"This is in sharp contrast with American policy."
"The time has come for us in this Parliament, on behalf of the European citizens, to establish our authority and leadership in this vital area of international trade."
"Mr President, I am awaiting the meeting in Seattle with mixed feelings."
"It is important to further free up world trade but this should be accompanied by pre-conditions at world level."
"In their policies, WTO Members should keep open the option of granting priority to public health, animal welfare, environmental protection and solidarity with developing countries."
"I would especially like to stress the position of the least developed countries."
"Their capacity to participate in the world trade system falls well below the mark."
"This is poignantly highlighted by the fact that Geneva has more lobbyists from the American steel industry than government officials from developing countries."
"Our negotiators should make every effort to bring about real participation of these countries by granting institutional support, free access to our markets, observing concessions made - when it comes, for example, to textile products - and preventing so-called ""green protectionism"" ."
"We cannot offer the western consumer the option of environmentally-friendly products without stimulating environmentally-friendly production processes in developing countries."
"I would like to exchange further ideas on this issue within the European Parliament."
"Finally, I would like to express my respect for the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, regarding his activities and his unstinting willingness to compromise given the flood of amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, by the year 2005 at the latest the trade talks opened in Seattle will have been completed."
"Mr Lamy, you will again be there, in 2005, sitting in the same seat, and you will come and tell us that the European Union has enjoyed worldwide success in these global talks."
"In the final text of the regulations you will have achieved some mention of the precautionary principle, of health, even phyto-sanitary matters, an ILO-OMC forum and the recognition of environmental principles, insofar as they have already been recognised at Kyoto."
"The dispute settlement procedure will have been improved."
"Developing countries will have obtained positive discrimination, financed, indeed, by the European Union, like the ACP bananas."
"Chickens will have a few more centimetres' room inside their cages, in the name of the animal welfare which will have been recognised, and the world of cinema and television will have obtained support in the form of a few aid programmes."
"In exchange, in order to achieve peace - and, indeed, a new peace clause - you will have made a number of concessions at Seattle."
"So, the ""European Market"" share will go from 5% to X%, there will only be residual internal support, export aid will have been prohibited, customs duties and tariff peaks will no longer be in place, direct investment will have been obtained thanks to Mr Lamy, and no thanks to the MAI, and the world market will have been established, a sort of commercial Fukuyama, and the GATT story will be over."
"Then what will we do?"
"The tenth round of the Uruguay Round will have no further business."
"You yourself could perhaps always go back to Crédit Lyonnais or to some multinational which hands out stock options."
"But what of the farmers, who will have been wiped out, the professions excluded from society, the textile industry, pharmaceuticals, shoes, heavy-duty vehicles, furniture, ships, toys, all that which will have been delivered up to competition from outside Europe, what is to become of them?"
"It is all very well for us to produce reports, books, television programmes and fine speeches."
"The children of the Seattle negotiators will have their place in the twenty-first century and the children of the people excluded from society will, in turn, be excluded, since poverty is a socially transmitted disease."
"But, in the end, all that is unimportant."
"We are still strong enough to carry everyone else' s burdens."
"May I begin by congratulating Mr Schwaiger on an excellent report."
"The Seattle round is being called the 'development round' for the millennium."
"I represent the south-east of England, one of the richest parts of the European Union, having been born in a developing country in Asia, one of the poorest parts of the world."
"I hope I can therefore span, understand and recognise the aspirations of the developed world, and of the developing world, recognising the enormous benefits of global free trade whilst also recognising the imperative need to manage the transition, to enable and empower the developing world to be an equal partner in globalisation."
"The multilateral trading system was born in Havana in 1948 as the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs."
"Eight rounds of trade globalisation have helped to promote global prosperity."
"Since 1951, world trade has grown 17-fold, world production more than quadrupled, world per capita income doubled, average tariffs dropped from 40% to 4% in industrialised countries."
"Today, a further cut of 50% in border protection, including agricultural subsidies, would add over USD 370 billion to global annual welfare gains."
"Sixty per cent of this would accrue to developing countries."
"However, globalisation must be a win-win situation."
"There should not be winners and losers."
"Everyone should win."
"It can be made to happen."
"How can it be made to happen?"
"The multilateral system should be fair, transparent, accountable and link trade to development."
"It should look at the impact of liberalisation on investments, competition rules, unfair subsidies, poor labour standards, environmental protection, intellectual property rights, trade facilitation, government procurement, improved access to agricultural markets, improved access to commercial markets including services, consumer protection and capacity building."
"The European Union is unique in terms of the history of its relationships with countries around the world - Britain with the Commonwealth, France with its French francophone countries."
"We can send a clear message to Seattle that this is the single contribution that this House and its Members can make to world global trade."
"Madam President, as others have said, I welcome Mr Schwaiger' s excellent work on what was a very complex set of issues to deal with."
"I also particularly welcome the fact that in his text he describes the forthcoming WTO round as a development round."
"It is a fact, of course, that of the 134 members of the WTO, two-thirds are developing countries, with another 32 in a queue waiting to join."
"But it remains the case that the exchange of trade commitments favours the bigger traders."
"They have much more to offer and their negotiating power is far greater."
"Many developing countries feel that free trade has not in fact been as free for them."
"Markets in the North remain restricted for many, as the most important developing country exports seek access."
"Accelerating globalisation is, of course, a fact of life."
"It nevertheless demands analysis and an acknowledgement that international trade is complex and is characterised by protectionism and by a system which fails to address the implications of subsidised agriculture for the poor."
"While we need, of course, to support the agricultural sector in the EU, and that is made clear in Mr Schwaiger' s report, we also have to recognise the need for developing economies beyond reaching markets to have access to food security so that people have enough to eat."
"And I hope that amendments along those lines will be accepted."
"The EU already has binding commitments to developing countries."
"These commitments, alongside international development targets, should be a central focus at Seattle."
"We are now, Mr Lamy, at a critical stage in the negotiations for a successor agreement to Lomé IV and we will soon be embarking on complex discussions on trade relations with 71 ACP countries."
"It is therefore very important now that we are negotiating a multilateral trade framework which respects that very critical relationship with the developing world that we continue to say that we will honour our obligations to the ACP."
"I would also urge the Commission and Member States to pursue a WTO binding commitment to allow all exports from least-developed countries duty-free access to European markets by 2003."
"There is also an urgent need to make sure that small and vulnerable states - landlocked states - are protected in future deals that are made."
"A Director-General of the WTO very recently said that the WTO must be an organisation where the little guy not only has a say but feels that he is protected and defended."
"I hope, Mr Lamy, that you will subscribe to that very important sentiment."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the liberal group sanctions the agreement reached on Sunday between China and the United States regarding the lowering of bilateral barriers to trade."
"However, the European Union now also has to conclude the same agreement with China before actual entry into the WTO can take place."
"Mr Clegg has already touched upon this."
"There are a few sensitive issues, one of which is intellectual property rights."
"The liberal group would bring up another condition for China' s entry."
"The European Parliament has emphasised in various resolutions that Taiwan should enter at the same time as China."
"Indeed, Taiwan is the nineteenth trading nation globally and has met all conditions of entry for years now."
"I would therefore put two concrete questions to the Commissioner."
"Firstly, what is the state of play regarding the Union' s negotiations with China, in particular with regard to intellectual property rights?"
"Secondly, is the Commissioner prepared to fully back Taiwan' s entry into the WTO at the same time as China?"
"Madam President, the previous speaker finished by saying that nature and human beings are being exploited."
"I can agree with him."
"The new millennium simply represents the free trade ideology."
"We have experience of the free trade in capital."
"It is called globalisation."
"It is electronic capitalism."
"In fact, it is not free trade, as the IMF has given American investors guarantees regarding the risks they take, and paid them damages that have been incurred by the free trade in capital."
"There are no rules in the capital game and politicians can no longer become referees."
"However, it is now possible to negotiate rules for the trade in goods and services, and it is possible to act in such a way that capital freedoms do not spread their exploitative power on such a broad global scale as electronic capitalism."
"I defend green protectionism because I want us to eat healthy food and I want it to be produced in a sustainable way."
"That cannot be called protectionism, as it is a question of survival."
"I also defend red protectionism, which tries to safeguard workers' rights and prevent malpractice, such as the use of child labour."
"In this respect also this type of protectionism is, from the point of view of social security, a question of survival."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the excellent report that we have all read."
"In my opinion, the Millennium Round is taking place at a very special time for the European economy, and the international economy in particular."
"Indeed, globalisation is now a subject that is discussed on a daily basis."
"It has lead to the free market and to victory over any economic theory."
"Having said that, I do not mean that we have a perfect market and, precisely for this reason, being aware of both the benefits and the corruption, we must seek to establish standards and regulations by means of agreements such as those proposed by the WTO in order to insure all of us against excesses of any type. Just think of the financial speculation that can overwhelm entire geographical areas, reducing them to poverty or even causing institutional upheaval."
"Having said that, the WTO round of negotiations is not being used to create something that is supranational, as is often feared, something that circumvents international rights or does not want to let the free market fluctuate, but it is being used to set out, in particular, specific rules for all of us, at the same time safeguarding certain fundamental rights such as the right to health, education and social duties in a framework that protects the rights of each individual citizen."
"However, as far as the prices of products and services are concerned, we must ask for not only a tariff reduction but, above all, we should also make a request in terms of the quality of the products and services themselves, as a means of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This will be increasingly important in the future, and there is also the increasing need to emphasise the central importance of agriculture within individual economies, and - and this is stressed in the report, but increasingly, each one of us needs to press forward resolutely with this - to protect small and medium-sized enterprises with appropriate legislation."
"If we manage to comply with these obligations and improve quality of life with sustainable development, both in economic and environmental terms, we will have laid strong foundations for a better society in the next millennium."
"Madam President, I would just like to say two things."
"The first is that, too often during the daily debates in this Chamber, we have heard talk of international trade and the Millennium Round as if they were something that we Europeans should be wary of, something to fear."
"Over the last few decades, over the recent quinquennia, international trade - Europe is the homeland of David Ricardo - has allowed us to create wealth, thanks to a new international division of labour. It has also brought about social inclusion and has defeated poverty which, given the growth in population, would have been much worse than it actually is today without international trade."
"One final point: we are trying to include too many things, too many requests on different subjects in the Millennium Round talks, perhaps to ease our conscience, when - and I am referring to capital punishment - in its own forum and at the UN, Europe cannot manage to put up a united front or find the strength to impose certain things."
"And then we want to debate capital punishment and other subjects in fora for trade agreements where it is inappropriate."
"Madam President, Mr Lamy, I would like to point out that expanding free trade also opens up scope for Europe."
"We should not have any fears in this respect."
"However, my concern is that the world, further to a new WTO agreement, may become richer economically speaking but poorer in the area of culture and environment or in terms of agriculture or horticulture, and that we may lose out on business in those areas which are essential for Europe."
"It is important to find a balance in this respect."
"This is why I am delighted with the Schwaiger report, because this very report indicates that we should hold on to what is essential to us, whilst keeping an open mind towards the world, and because this report links political reality and the issues we can defend on behalf of Europe' s citizens in our capacity as parliamentarians."
"It is essential that we voice the issues that are apparent within Europe."
"I would also like to make two remarks regarding agriculture and horticulture."
"The representative of the Council said this morning that the Berlin Agreement forms the starting point for these negotiations, but he also mentioned that agriculture could well prove to be a sticking point. In this respect, I feel that Europe should be more on the offensive."
"May I remind you that as a trading bloc, we are the largest importer and second largest exporter?"
"At the same time, in a couple of years, out of the total budget for agriculture, horticulture and rural development, a mere 10% will be earmarked for product support."
"In other words, if we take into account the national budget, then we note that only 2% of government spending within Europe is set aside for agriculture, horticulture and rural development."
"If we refer to the 10% of this amount for product support, this is a negligible amount worldwide."
"To all those who advocate the dismantling of agricultural policy within the framework of the WTO, I would like to point out that Europe boasts its own standard in terms of the environment, animal welfare and consumer protection."
"Whoever is in favour of scrapping the European agricultural policy, also favours the scrapping of all we have acquired in Europe in terms of rural policy, animal welfare and welfare in general."
"This means that I also defend the European standard and we, as a Parliament, have to opt in favour of the Schwaiger report, because it offers guarantees for freer trade but, at the same time, also offers guarantees for preserving what we pride ourselves on, rightly so, within Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in a world which is becoming more and more interdependent, in which the problems which affect us usually have their roots in areas poles apart from us, we are obliged to work together with other countries in order to manage the planet' s resources properly, by respecting rules which are common to all of us."
"Commissioner, fishing is a sensitive area which must be discussed in the Millennium Round in accordance with its characteristics and through an interpretation which links it to agricultural products, as laid down in the Treaty."
"This is because agriculture and fisheries have similar characteristics for us Europeans."
"Both activities are linked to the sustainable exploitation of natural resources and both affect the economic and social cohesion of Europe."
"Fishing and agriculture guarantee the survival of our socio-economic fabric and contribute in a fundamental way to the supply of our food market."
"Mr Lamy, fish are not shoes or screws."
"They cannot therefore be treated as non-agricultural products in Seattle."
"Agriculture and fishing provide us with food."
"The inevitable globalisation of the market must not mean a lowering of our food safety standards nor of the social rights of our workers, nor must it lead us to forget our poorer regions."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the next trade round in Seattle should enhance and reinforce the basis for fair and free world trade in the next millennium."
"We have to grab this unique chance with both hands to tackle the problems of the future."
"This is why it is important not to restrict ourselves in the negotiations to two topics only, namely agriculture and services."
"There are other important topics which require a solution at international level."
"For example, we need stricter rules for the environment and labour, an effective competition policy should be drafted and it is important that appropriate measures be taken regarding food safety."
"This is why I fail to understand why some take such a sceptical, or even hostile, stance regarding this coming trade negotiation."
"This may well be down to an inadequate policy which lacks in transparency."
"It is therefore time that the World Trade Organisation asserts itself and underlines its significance as the World Trade Organisation."
"Free trade is not a dirty word."
"Trade liberalisation based on equal and fair conditions gives globalisation a human face."
"After all, fair and correct trade at world level implies attention to ecological and social aspects and takes into account all the players involved, thereby including the developing countries."
"As such, I only hope that the EU negotiators stamp their authority on the discussions, thus immediately authenticating the WTO' s fundamental right of existence as an international organisation now and in the future."
"Madam President, following the agreement between China and the United States on membership of the World Trade Organisation, I ought perhaps, in my capacity as head of the China delegation, to be as jubilant as the international finance markets."
"""China is becoming a modern country now,"" it is said."
"""Therefore, it is also becoming democratic"" ."
"One commentator even believes that the Chinese Communist Party' s monopoly on power will be broken because membership of the World Trade Organisation means freedom of communication, including by means of unchecked Internet contacts."
"We can only hope that this will be the case."
"But might it not equally well happen instead that the regime will be reinforced by means of a form of economic growth which favours an urban minority but simultaneously creates tens of millions of new unemployed when state enterprises are left to go under, ruthlessly and without any networks of social protection, at the same time as millions of farmers become unemployed because of the new competition in the agricultural sphere?"
"Now, it is the case that China cannot become a member of the World Trade Organisation without the EU' s also agreeing to this."
"I really hope therefore that, in its negotiations with China, the European Commission will take account of all the social and ecological aspects of the issue which the Americans clearly cared not one little bit about when they negotiated with the Chinese."
"Mr President, the way in which the global market has been divided up within the WTO is not based on the interests of the people or on the interests of workers."
"In the forthcoming round of negotiations, the forces of capitalism are aiming to tear down the final barriers to their freedom of action and their world domination."
"Full liberalisation of the market, the abolition of subsidies and the involvement of the WTO in negotiations for uncontrolled investment will make the smaller countries hostages to the larger countries and their peoples pawns at the mercy of monopolies."
"The aim of the commercialisation of services, even of education, health and culture, is to deprive the working class and the people in general of many of their achievements gained over the century."
"We do not believe that the governments of the European Union countries will defend the interests of their peoples."
"They will, on the contrary, endeavour to make European monopolies compete better with the other imperialist interests in the USA and Japan."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party will be voting against the Schwaiger report because it sides with monopoly capital in its attack on workers and the people of the world."
"Rules governing international economic relations and trade should respect fundamental social rights, serve the interests of workers, promote development in the less developed countries, respect the environment and create the conditions for the development of all peoples."
"Mr President, what should be welcomed in the Schwaiger report is the attempt to reconcile what up until now has been irreconcilable, and the obvious efforts of the rapporteur can be seen right from the first recital, where recognition of the significant increase in world trade thanks to multilateral relations can only stand in contrast to the lack of any substantial reduction in the world' s economic inequalities."
"Here, it is not a question of expressing our opposition to pursuing greater efficiency in the multilateral relations system, but rather a question of paying the greatest attention to some important aspects."
"If the first is the continuation of the inequalities between developing countries and industrialised countries, then there is also the social dumping that is being created within these very industrialised countries."
"It is undeniable that the process of European convergence for the launch of the single currency has led to occasions and opportunities for growth and development in all Member States."
"Nevertheless, today, we are confronted by a different process of convergence that is underway, in particular, between territorial macro-contexts where Europe seems to present itself in positions that certainly are not strong, with the risk, therefore, that its economic characteristics - founded on small and medium-sized businesses - will be compromised, as well as its cultural and social characteristics."
"In this respect, we do not think that public safeguards and duties such as schools, welfare systems - including health - and pension schemes can be part of the services to be regulated."
"The second aspect relates to agriculture, for which, along with greater liberalisation of the market in favour of developing countries, there is the request not only for the Community principles to be upheld - support for environmental policy and the drawing up of a food policy for consumer protection - but also for typical national agricultural characteristics and products to be protected."
"The third aspect relates to investments and related rules, but also to the local conditions for the implementation thereof."
"The condition of tariff and fiscal advantage is one of the first conditions, and the premise should at least be to harmonise the financial institutions, if not the tax rates."
"Moreover, the States' recognised prerogative on this policy should also be translated into the possibility of a differentiated application throughout the States' territories, otherwise - apart from the simplification of the processes - the only condition remaining would be the flexibility of labour."
"However, we hope that in this regard, the principles of the ILO and related conventions will be taken on board, starting with the convention on the protection of working minors."
"Finally, we hope that Parliament will be able to play an active part in the Millennium Round, starting with prior knowledge of the Commission' s study on the estimated impact of the effects of the new regulatory process."
"Mr President, the previous speaker pointed out that this report tries to reconcile the irreconcilable."
"I think he is right up to a point, which makes the rapporteur' s work all the more remarkable and meritorious and I thank him."
"Furthermore it highlights the difficult nature of the task which we will have to face."
"A few months ago, in this Parliament, we examined a report on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment which, in a very dramatic way, began by saying that we were discussing a world economic constitution."
"If that was true then, it is even more true now, given that we are going to discuss issues such as agriculture, services, intellectual property and direct investment."
"It is difficult when, as the rapporteur said at the beginning, it is not a question of simply opting for free trade, but rather opting for a just form of free trade."
"And so that this free trade may be a just free trade, it is clear that we have to reconcile trading practices with the rules regarding the environment, workers' rights, the European agricultural model and consumer protection."
"To sum up, we are going to discuss practically everything, every sector and every Community policy."
"Therefore the important issue at the moment is the method which we must follow."
"And in this report the rapporteur - and I am with him - opts for a Commission which will act as a major player."
"We call on all the States to back the Commission, we call on the Commission to take account of the sensibilities and needs of the candidate and associated countries and we call on the Intergovernmental Conference to broaden the negotiating capacities of the Commission."
"But, since love is rewarded by love, all of this will only be possible if the Commission responds to Parliament by treating it as a partner and accomplice in the negotiating strategy with regard to the recommendations of the various sectors, the negotiating guidelines and the approval of the Treaties."
"Only in this way, Commissioner, will we be able to work together over these three years because - believe me - all of us have tables covered in documents and requests from the various sectors involved and we will only be able to satisfy them if the Commission is able to satisfy our demands."
"As Tenorio said ""If you do it like that, may God reward you or, if not, may he punish you"" ."
"Commissioner, Mr President, I think that Europe must state three main principles in this Millennium Round."
"The first is that the aim of this round must be to reduce inequalities in development, unlike what has happened after previous rounds."
"Today, the African continent has a less than 3% share of world trade."
"The rules of the multilateral trade system must take account of the differences in countries' situations, resources and levels of development."
"Free trade which does not take any other factors into account just makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker."
"This is why we would not be able to accept a challenge to the principles of our cooperation with the countries of the south, particularly with ACP countries, and of course in this context I am thinking of the Lomé Convention."
"I think, on the contrary, that we should restate the commitments that we made at the ACP-EU Joint Assembly which was held a few weeks ago."
"Europe must go to Seattle with a concept of globalisation that is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by just one power."
"Europe must, on the contrary, promote a concept based on a multipolar world and encourage the establishment of economically and politically integrated regional groups, as we have ourselves been trying to do for the last forty years."
"How can we refuse others what we granted ourselves after the war, to reconstruct our industry, agriculture and economy?"
"Secondly, we must confine the WTO, strictly limit its role and keep isolated from the WTO' s sphere of competence those sectors which jeopardise society' s very identity and which must continue to remain the sovereignty of the citizens and of their elected institutions."
"Education, health, public and social services, public transport and culture are all examples of sectors which cannot be brought into trade negotiations and cannot be dealt with by an international trade court."
"We must refuse to join the race to make every sector subject to the market."
"Thirdly, we must defend the principle of a hierarchy of norms."
"The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, and those on the environment are, by their very nature, superior to the standards that govern trade."
"We should not condemn a State on the grounds that it is applying the precautionary principle, that it is protecting its environment or that it is refusing imports which are proven to have been produced by child labour."
"On the contrary, we must be able to bring an appeal against a decision by the WTO before the International Labour Organisation or before the competent bodies at the United Nations."
"On the eve of this new round, we are struck by the way society at large and international public opinion have forced their way into the debate."
"I think that this is an excellent development, because it is the best guarantee that it will not be possible to drop these issues during these negotiations."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Schwaiger for a balanced report."
"We are embarking on an important process at Seattle, from the point of view of global development and global controllability."
"The world also needs rules and standards; competition alone is not enough, although our main aim with the WTO process is the more efficient organisation of trade."
"It is an immense challenge."
"The EU is promoting a solution to the challenges of Third World sustainable development and social justices."
"We have to remain firm in this objective."
"Although the liberalisation of world trade means economic benefits and prosperity, we also have to view it critically."
"In addition to a freer market in the production of food, we should be talking not only about the precautionary principle, but also about supporting local production and encouraging regional food chains."
"The best guarantee of food safety is transparency of the food chain and clear areas of monitoring and responsibility."
"The EU must have a clear idea of priorities in the talks."
"In brief, we could say that the viability of European family agriculture is a guarantee of the purity of food."
"For that reason, the most important issue in the WTO talks will be securing adequate amounts of aid to ensure agriculture is profitable."
"That is also why the existence of the blue box, alongside the green, is essential to preserve the European model."
"There is no question of horsetrading when it comes to matters of agriculture and food safety."
"Although we are trying to reduce import barriers for industrial products and services, it cannot be done at the expense of health."
"The WTO, which was created in order to speed up the liberalisation of trade, has become one of the essential pillars of the new world order."
"Not only does it support globalisation, but it is also committed to giving it form and the force of law in order to impose dictatorship by the market."
"It actively contributes to the establishment of neo-liberal policies which find their expression in attacks upon public services, the right to employment, health and food safety and upon the environment."
"Unfortunately, the European delegation subscribes to the liberal way of thinking."
"It advocates an extension of the WTO' s powers, which is completely rejected by the associations and organisations that have become involved, who are instead calling for both an assessment of the WTO' s last five years and a moratorium on the forthcoming negotiations."
"We support this approach which is a first step towards radically questioning the capitalist world order."
"This is why we cannot vote for the Schwaiger report."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago, I argued here that we Europeans should adopt a firm, credible and coherent position in order to give a social dimension to the liberalisation of trade."
"And I am delighted at the convergence of views between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on this matter."
"This convergence is based on respect for the Declaration on Workers' Fundamental Rights adopted by the International Labour Organisation in 1988."
"This declaration takes into account both the interests of developing countries, and that is moreover why they, including China, adopted it, as well as the interests of workers, and that is why trade unions also accepted it."
"We must now make this declaration truly effective, by guaranteeing respect for it, and that means in the corridors of the World Trade Organisation, too."
"Minister, Commissioner, I do not think that achieving meaningful cooperation between the WTO and the ILO, by whatever means, is an impossible task."
"All the more reason to try to succeed."
"Mr President, the new round of trade negotiations will take place five years after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round."
"And here we MEPs clearly have to communicate the concerns of our electors with regard to this round, which will be very important."
"There is an aspect in relation to which we can say that our results are bad."
"I refer to the dispute settlement procedure."
"We have had two significant disputes - over bananas and hormones - which the European Union lost, and there has been one dispute which we have not even dared to put before the settlement system: I am referring to the American Helms-Burton and d' Amato laws for extra-territorial application to European companies."
"I have the impression that this issue will have to be reviewed at the World Conference, at the World Round."
"I believe that we will have to see how the mechanism for the settlement of disputes can be adjusted according to the needs."
"There are also other legal aspects, because the Treaty of the World Trade Organisation is not a unique treaty."
"There are other international treaties, such as those agreed within the framework of the International Labour Organisation, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the multilateral agreements relating to the environment."
"I hope that in the Seattle Conference these issues will be dealt with in such a way that the new agreements will, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, bring about an appropriate legal framework."
"Mr President, the new WTO round is sending out its subliminal signals."
"For example, even America and China have come closer together over the WTO question."
"It is precisely a rapprochement of this kind that we in the EU-China Delegation have spent long years trying to achieve."
"So the wheel of history, for whose fashioning we are partly responsible, does turn constructively and progressively provided that traders' concepts and ideas, stamina and charisma have the power to convince."
"That applies across the board but also to particular sectors of industry and, naturally and quite specifically, to the maritime sector, therefore."
"Waterways bind routes and continents on our planet, and they are rich in as yet unexhausted natural resources."
"Through new technological developments, shipping and shipbuilding can again be sectors of the economy which are aiming high."
"Who would have thought so just a short time ago?"
"We are fighting for a similarly positive status for the fisheries sector, too."
"In spite of the basically different methods of management, I am therefore appealing, for example, to Mr Cunha, as agricultural rapporteur, to also consider the fisheries sector, particularly since Mr Cunha is also my coordinator on the Committee on Fisheries."
"Who would want to dispute the fact? In spite of the tiny budget allocated to it, an efficient fisheries sector forms a not insignificant part of any dynamic trade and budget policy for the EU and should be seen as a sector of the economy in its own right and as a significant branch of the food industry."
"There are also a large number of jobs concentrated there - in the EU, in third countries and worldwide."
"If we lose this sector, we weaken those regions which are already structurally weak anyway, and all in a quite irresponsible way."
"Let us beware, therefore, of regarding the WTO as a panacea for our problems."
"Only if we start from a healthy position at home will we make a convincing case to competitors on our planet."
"Even a totally liberalised market may possibly mean the exploitation of fish stocks beyond their ability to replenish themselves."
"I therefore want us to have a responsible and sustainable fisheries sector characterised by partnership, and I wish Mr Schwaiger and his team every success in the negotiations, not least for our own benefit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I am taking the floor in order to reiterate some of the points that have already been made here by several of my colleagues from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the effect that we are in favour of a round of negotiations, but not just any old round of negotiations."
"This can be expressed through our socialist philosophy: we are in favour of a market economy, but we are opposed to a market society."
"And this philosophical train of thought is causing us to diverge from two opposing visions that are in play at this Seattle Summit."
"The first is held by those who think that the market does not create wealth: we, on the other hand, think that the market does create wealth."
"It is we socialists who uphold the idea that the market helps to create wealth, but that there must be regulation for there to be a redistribution of this wealth which is equitable and which respects sustainable development from which we should all benefit."
"This is a different vision that is far ahead of the two I have mentioned."
"It is a demanding and critical vision that is at the root of the way we are acting with regard to the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"And this is why we are against sectorial negotiations and are in favour of all-encompassing negotiations. This is why we are in favour of seeing the WTO and its respective negotiations as an instrument for the creation of a fairer society, of a more sustained development, in which mankind is actually the focus of all decision making."
"And from this point of view, we state here once again the need to respect environmental matters, the need to respect the consumer and the need to respect human as well as social rights. And from this point of view, Mr President, and to end my intervention, we would like to offer all our support and all our cooperation to Commissioner Lamy on the objectives and the strategic viewpoints that he is well aware he needs to uphold in Seattle."
"Mr President, three brief remarks about the Millennium Round and cultural diversity."
"First of all, the EU is a success story, an economic community which has put its faith in open markets and given people security in the social sphere, together with economic prosperity."
"However, the European Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values."
"To uphold these values and to secure the cultural diversity of Europe are indispensable tasks at a time when the economies of the world are increasingly interrelated."
"I should therefore particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in the way he has introduced the subject of securing the cultural heritage of Europe into the report for the Millennium Round."
"In the meantime, there are two goals."
"On the one hand, the dynamic development of electronic services ought not to be impeded."
"On the contrary, it must be facilitated for, like no other branch of industry, it guarantees jobs that are safe for the future, both in Europe and worldwide."
"On the other hand, we shall have to be in a position to support and promote the diversity of our European cultural heritage in the future too, and this by means of promotional measures taken also by the Member States."
"The Schwaiger report facilitates both goals."
"It has therefore earned broad support from us all."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Schwaiger."
"While stressing that we must have a WTO Millennium Round that is as comprehensive as possible so that everybody can get something out of it, there are three issues I would like to draw attention to."
"I am very pleased that Parliament, the Commission and the Council have highlighted animal welfare in their presentations."
"It is an important issue for citizens, it is an important issue for many of us here in this House and it is important that it is debated at Seattle."
"I think we must also learn the lessons of the multilateral agreement on investments."
"Yes, it will be possible for competition and investment to be dealt with at Seattle, but it is important that they are dealt with in a transparent and open way."
"The WTO must explain to its citizens what it is doing or it will run the risk of undermining support for free trade."
"It is equally important that as broad as possible a consultation is actually put in place to enable the different points of view to be heard and to be understood when we deal with competition and investment."
"And, thirdly, there is the dispute settlement system itself."
"It was an undoubted success of the Uruguay Round, but there are problems associated with it."
"Seattle must close those loopholes, again on the basis of transparency and greater certainty about the rights and obligations of all those involved in the dispute settlement system."
"That will offer us a key potential for unlocking world trade."
"In conclusion we must never lose sight of the fact that globalisation is very much about human issues, it is about standards of living, the environment, cultural, moral and ethical issues."
"Some fear the WTO, some fear globalisation, some fear the advance of growth, markets, technology and science."
"But I believe by working together openly with the common goal of raising the quality of life for the whole world, we can actually confound the critics of globalisation and show that globalisation and liberalisation can genuinely be a decisive force for good."
"Mr President, the world economy is now facing problems similar to those it faced before the beginning of the Uruguay Round 13 years ago."
"We are confronted with generally slackening growth, and that in a world with an exploding population There are six billion people in the world; one billion are hungry; and more than 30 million people die of starvation each year, including - horrifically - many children."
"And we, the rich of this world, have a duty to try to reduce this misery and hunger."
"I am firmly convinced that a further liberalisation and expansion of trade in the framework provided by the WTO will contribute to promoting growth and employment in the developing countries as well."
"As general rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection for the WTO negotiations, I should particularly like to thank Mr Schwaiger for his clear words on the subject of trade and the environment."
"It was not straightforward."
"But if, by the end of tomorrow, Parliament has accepted the Schwaiger Report, then we shall have endorsed his words and decided that account must be taken of environmental protection as a condition for all areas of world trade; not a wishy-washy may or ought to be, but must be."
"I believe we are heading for very exciting negotiations indeed and, as has been said very often today, we Europeans most certainly have an historic role to play in these."
"Mr President, at Marrakech we were promised an assessment of the previous round of negotiations before entering into new negotiations."
"Today, this assessment has still not been made and there is a simple reason for that: it would not be a positive one."
"It would say that we should kill off liberal dogmas, as well as the old theory which says that wealth is created by developing trade."
"In 50 years, the volume of trade has increased seventeen-fold, whereas we have only produced twice as many goods in the world."
"It would also kill off the idea which says that the future of third-world countries would be improved."
"Inequalities have continued to increase there as they have in our own countries."
"It would say that we should change course, and that is what we are asking you to do, Commissioner."
"Changing course means firstly obtaining, by means of the existing package, the one that has already been negotiated, real social and environmental regulations, instead of vague references to standards that are never applied."
"Yes, that means setting up a logical approach in opposition to ecological and social dumping."
"This assessment would say ""Beware, so as not to open up Pandora' s box in other sectors and I am thinking here particularly of investments."
"This Parliament has said ""no"" to the MAI for sound reasons and you, Commissioner, must uphold these arguments in order to prevent the investment sector experiencing the disasters we have seen happen in other areas."
"Finally, this assessment would condemn the patentability of ""living things"" and the fact that plants and life itself are becoming saleable commodities."
"The 20th century has been characterised by a fundamental crisis of humanism as a result of xenophobia and acts of genocide."
"I would not like to see the 21st century also characterised by a crisis of humanity on account of the all-powerful principles of money and the market taking precedence over the development of mankind and over the fundamental values that make human life what it is."
"Mr President, I too want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on an excellent report."
"A lot of people are now criticising the World Trade Organisation for looking too one-sidedly at trade, for seeing trade as an end in itself and for failing to see the complex connections between trade, human rights and environmental considerations."
"I agree with parts of these criticisms but I do not draw the conclusion that we do not need a new trade round."
"On the contrary, I believe that the status quo is not something we can profit by."
"Instead, we have everything to gain from a new round because there is so much greater understanding today of these complex connections and of the fact that development questions and environmental questions have to be discussed in the one context."
"I would remind you of the World Trade Organisation' s latest report which deals very perceptively with just such environmental questions."
"Allow me to consider two special aspects of what we are discussing."
"The Commission rightly says that the present round is to be a development round."
"In a situation in which the level of aid is declining, I find it difficult to see, however, how this is going to be the case if we do not see a radical change."
"There are some who see a contradiction between aid and trade."
"They say that trade should help the poorest countries to get out of the situation they are in."
"I think that the question has been put in the wrong way."
"We need both: aid as well as trade."
"We must therefore link these questions to our aid work."
"Increased trade can, of course, have a positive effect on the environment, for example through the transfer of technology adapted to environmental requirements."
"The opposite may, however, also apply, mainly because our economic framework is not good at taking due account of environmental consequences."
"That is why it is so important that the trade regulations should take increased account of these factors."
"The question, when we now read this report and make every kind of demand upon the World Trade Organisation, is simply that of whether the World Trade Organisation can settle all conceivable disputes in the future."
"I believe - and this is an important conclusion - that, parallel to our making the World Trade Organisation ""greener"" , we must also strengthen the international conventions on the environment."
"The fact is that they are far too weak at present."
"Mr President, I consider the Millennium Round to be an important opportunity to promote the opening of the international markets to competition, to extend the guarantees against anti-competition practices and to finally address the subject of investments as well."
"The liberalisation of world trade is a positive process that generates growth and that can be hindered, not only by the protectionist practices of the States, but also by the creation of situations where competition is distorted, such as in the event of the abuse of dominant positions, cartels and dumping - think of the example of the shipbuilding industry - which are so harmful to Europe."
"This is something that is largely new for the World Trade Organisation, but I think it extremely important."
"Similarly, a new area for talks should be the quest to open up national markets to foreign investments."
"It is important that the Schwaiger report and Parliament recognise the World Trade Organisation as the appropriate forum for serious negotiations on investments, seeking certainty and clarity of the law on the protection of investments, but also, obviously, the protection of state legislation in social, environmental and cultural fields."
"The Schwaiger report understandably puts more emphasis on safeguards, but I think that it is generally in harmony with the Commission proposal and therefore expresses full confidence in Commissioner Lamy' s work with regard to this sensitive topic as well, in full awareness that the liberalisation of international trade, even in new fields - as with investments - is an important concern for the countries of the European Union and all the countries which have an interest in lasting and sustainable development of the global economy."
"Mr President, the commitment of the European Union, repeated in the Schwaiger report, to the creation of a permanent labour forum between the International Labour Organisation and the World Trade Organisation on issues related to trade, globalisation and labour is the only way to accompany the liberalisation of commerce and trade in general with respect for fundamental labour rights, without slipping into egotistical, hypocritical protectionism or unfair, self-destructive competition."
"In this respect, the bilateral agreement that the United States has signed with China to prepare the way for China to join the World Trade Organisation must be regarded by the European Union, aside from as an important contribution to the multilateral process, also, and above all, as a fundamental opportunity to monitor the substantial importance that human rights have and will have regarding the opportunities afforded by a market that enjoys such enormous potential as the Chinese market."
"Let us remember, in this regard, that the 174 member countries of the ILO which, with the solemn declaration of 1998, undertook to comply with the four categories of fundamental labour rights, even where they did not ratify the conventions, are, in the main, also members of the WTO."
"Now, since the international bodies are what the Member States want them to be, it is legitimate to ask these same States to behave in a consistent manner throughout the fora."
"The desirable entry of China, which the European Union is also actively negotiating for, will certainly make the WTO more representative and will extend the potential ability to realise global free trade that is also regulated."
"Nevertheless, that does not mean deluding ourselves that many of the problems regarding fundamental rights in China have now been resolved or are being resolved, nor ignoring the fact that, in the past, the United States itself has had double standards regarding the request for the social clause to be complied with."
"It is, however, better that it is possible for the attempt to affirm these rights to be made within the walls of the international institutions, rather than in bilateral fora, according to what is convenient at the time."
"Mr President, as the last in the line of socialist speakers, I would like to draw your attention to one aspect which has not yet been dealt with at length, namely the patenting of live organisms."
"Many third-world countries have objected to this, as this practice makes deep inroads into the very existence of millions of farmers."
"If applications for patents could be made on existing agricultural crops, this would mean farmers becoming more dependent on large companies."
"They would need to pay for sowing seed, which would affect their very raison d' être."
"As a result of this, food safety would be in the balance."
"A large group of third-world countries, Kenya being the spokesperson, has called for a review of the TRIPS Agreement."
"In order to accommodate the developing countries, it would be a good idea to actually carry out this review."
"But this is not the only reason."
"From an economic point of view, there are major disadvantages attached to the current practice, as this can lead to a handful of companies being in unacceptable positions of power."
"There are also ethical objections to the patenting of live organisms."
"These objections have also been tabled in the Council when the Biotechnology Directive was laid down."
"This is why I would like to ask Commissioner Lamy, and Parliament, to take seriously the objections raised by third-world countries, but also the ethical and economic objections raised within Europe."
"An assessment of the present regulation would be a first step."
"Mr President, the Seattle Conference is not an invitation from the United States to the rest of the world to impose the vision of absolute and unbridled free trade."
"It is exactly the opposite."
"The World Trade Organisation is a European idea, one to which the Americans were converted in Marrakech, after having opposed it for a long time."
"With regard to Seattle, it is the Europeans, not the Americans who are proposing the greater agenda: the Millennium Round is our idea."
"It is the Europeans, not the Americans, who have gained the most from previous negotiations."
"Since 1995 the United States' trade deficit towards us has grown spectacularly: almost USD 30 billion last year."
"Anyway, the issue is not unregulated trade, but quite the opposite, to ensure that the formidable growth of trade serves everyone' s long-term development and not just the predatory enrichment of the strongest."
"We want increased levels of trade and the elimination of the many barriers that still remain in some countries for some goods and for most services."
"We want fair trade for everyone and by that I mean equal conditions for competition."
"They are not equal in agriculture, or in cultural sectors."
"There must be rules for competition and a court to ensure that they are respected, and that means by the strongest, too, with regard to the weakest."
"Finally, we want trade that benefits sustainable development, by creating a link between trade agreements and our other major international commitments on fundamental labour rights, on food safety and on environmental protection."
"Basically, we have to undertake, on a worldwide scale, the course of action that enabled us to succeed in Europe when we moved from the Customs Union to the Single Area, and that is why Europe has the most to bring to the negotiations and has the right to expect the most from it."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council Sasi, Commissioner Lamy, I wish to add my voice to the many here who have expressed their thanks to Mr Schwaiger."
"He has presented a good report."
"The report addresses the important points and says, above all, that we in principle support the Commission and the Council."
"However, we are clearer about some points than the Commission and the Council have been so far."
"I am speaking, for example, about environmental standards."
"What we want, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, is for attention not only to be given to environmental damage caused in Europe by products from other countries. We also want more thorough discussion of processes and production methods (PPM) in other countries and to talk not only about labelling but also about how, through trade sanctions, we can prevent worldwide damage to the environment from taking place."
"In fact, the Liberals have submitted a very good Amendment to the Committee, and this may be found as number 47 in the resolution we have before us."
"It is a question of being able to impose trade sanctions relating to production methods whenever there is a danger of worldwide damage to the environment."
"The WTO' s Shrimps-Turtle judgement at least presents an attempt to argue along these lines, for the Shrimps look alike whether or not they have been caught in accordance with the rules concerning animal protection."
"The WTO has said: in principle, this can be discussed."
"It is important that we also discuss climate protection in this context, for the world decided in Rio in 1992 and in Kyoto in 1997 that this is a huge problem and that we must tackle it together."
"There must, therefore, also be opportunities to implement climate protection measures in the WTO."
"To conclude, I should like to support all those who have come out in favour of a courageous position in respect of the least developed countries, the LLDC."
"I should like, however, to emphasise that these are not only ACP countries but that there are also many countries outside the ACP area to which we must provide better support."
"I am among those who argue that all products should be completely free from customs duties and that we should not be defining so-called sensitive products, only then to make exceptions of them again."
"Mr President, the drafting of the agenda for the coming Millennium Round raises quite a few questions with me."
"I cannot shake off the impression I have that the desiderata of the developing countries threaten to be pulverised by the desiderata of the major economic blocs."
"When elephants fight, the grass is trampled underfoot."
"Africa is all too aware of this."
"If Europe and the US argue today about genetically modified organisms and the use of hormones and antibiotics in cattle breeding, then improved market access for the developing countries and their involvement in the world economy will threaten to fade into the background."
"So it is up to us to ensure that in a world of liberalised trading, there is room for social and ecological corrections and a gradual and guided involvement of third-world countries in the world economy."
"Otherwise, we might end up in an American world which only defends commerce with verve, but overlooks the other values of the European dream, namely solidarity alongside competitiveness and responsibility alongside economic growth."
"Surely it cannot be our intention to render everything subordinate to the one paradigm, which is to be disseminated from Seattle to the rest of the world?"
"Europe, and the European Parliament, in particular, must argue in favour of more equality in world trade relations."
"The impact of liberalisation of the economy on the development of the third world should be that of the wind that kindles a fire."
"The wind should be forceful enough, but not too forceful or else it will blow out the fire."
"In Seattle, we will help blow the bellows of the world economy."
"In my opinion, the excellent report of Mr Schwaiger indicates very well how we can reach out to the developing countries."
"I will therefore give it all my support."
"Mr President, I am concerned about the attitude which is in danger of developing in the EU where free trade is concerned."
"Attacks against the World Trade Organisation are significant, and the trade disputes we are experiencing and being drawn into are alarming."
"To be one-sidedly passionate about one' s own region' s traditions and characteristic ways of doing things by imposing restrictions in the context of trade policy is to risk removing the basis for trade and development and for the dissemination of knowledge, culture and prosperity."
"In the longer term, it can also lead to suspicion, stagnation and conflicts."
"When it comes to the Schwaiger report, which our excellent rapporteur has worked very thoroughly on, many Members of the European Parliament have devoted energy to tackling all the problems and disturbing elements which free trade is alleged to give rise to."
"I would therefore emphasise the contributions of free trade to reducing poverty and encouraging growth and the processes of democratisation."
"The power for development entailed in free trade and competition is something we cannot turn our backs on in the era of globalisation."
"The overriding task of the EU' s representatives in Seattle must therefore be that of continuing with the liberalisation of world trade."
"The new industries have relied upon the sets of regulations offered by the World Trade Organisation."
"In this way, they have been able to create prosperity in a very much better way than they would have done by means of endless subsidies from the rich man' s table."
"Protectionist measures would now prevent imports from these developing countries and limit the latter' s opportunities to contribute to the international division of labour."
"A policy of protecting markets therefore leads to a deterioration in working conditions in the poorer countries and runs counter to the kind of development we want to promote, that is to say improved living conditions achieved through growth and free trade."
"Mr President, what is especially gratifying about Mr Schwaiger' s report is that it shows that Parliament has, for its part, been able to increase coherence in the aims of the talks."
"The Union, through its earlier decisions, has been committed to consistency in different areas of policy."
"Thus, for example, trade policy must be in harmony with the Union' s policies on developing countries and the environment."
"Both areas of policy are now emphatically raised in the report and, as a new Member of Parliament, I can say that it comes as a pleasant surprise."
"Similarly, I could say that the proposed report gives a very balanced account of the position of the WTO in relationship to other multilateral treaties."
"In addition, strong support for the cooperation that has begun between the ILO and the WTO promises an even better level of coherence in this area."
"Once a working model has been found, it should also be applied to the way the WTO relates to other international organisations, which have overseen the drafting of similar agreements."
"It is also important that Parliament now outlines the importance of these multilateral agreements in the WTO' s dispute settlement procedure."
"As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I am satisfied that we are trying to include the precautionary principle in the set of rules of the WTO."
"The Union' s negotiators must be able to convince the other sides that the EU goal is not protectionism but the safeguarding of the welfare of the consumer."
"The Union would be wise to invite NGOs to discussions about the WTO while the round of talks is proceeding."
"Not only would it strengthen the legitimacy of Union action on our own turf, but the global NGO arena itself could help our negotiators to achieve the goals of the Union."
"Experience shows that debate in the NGO arena easily spreads from one continent to another."
"As the other sides unfortunately lag far behind, the EU needs the backing of the NGOs in its work to transform the WTO into a sustainable organisation in the areas of the environment, health and social welfare."
"At the Seattle round, the scope and power of the WTO will grow significantly, and that is why the EU should ensure that the effects of the liberalisation of trade and the action of the WTO are continually appraised from the point of view of ecology and fairness."
"Mr President, I am not absolutely convinced that the developed world needs free trade with the rest of the world in order to make economic progress."
"The bigger EU States like France, Germany and the United Kingdom traded about 30% of GDP in the 1960s as against 60% today, but they enjoyed much faster economic growth at that time than they do now."
"From 1950 to 1970 world economic growth and the expansion of world trade ran roughly in tandem, but since then economic growth has been increasing at only half the pace of world exports: so again there is no evidence there that increased trade leads automatically to further economic growth."
"It is quite obvious, of course, that small countries like Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg need free trade, but a European Union with a single market or a North American single market is an entirely different proposition."
"Nevertheless I believe in free trade."
"Because of the way the world is changing, globalisation is unstoppable unless, of course, we erect iron curtains or bamboo curtains, and those too would be blown away by the winds of change."
"Globalisation is happening and while there are risks it presents us with immense opportunities."
"The first opportunity is to create a partnership for cooperation and the management of the increased trading activities."
"Decision making in this way is not to by-pass democracy, it is to extend democracy."
"It is a new means by which to organise the activities of mankind."
"Behind our trade barriers there is the risk that we will cultivate the seeds of more international conflict."
"The rich could dig in behind their barriers, they could buy some essential things from the poorer countries but we would be back to the seventeenth century with the strong exploiting the weak."
"Those who are concerned about human rights, animal welfare and the environment have a much better prospect of securing improvements in those areas within a legal framework and a World Trade Organisation than they have in a free-for-all, law of the jungle."
"I want to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on putting together what I regard as a decent framework within which to move forward."
"There will be risks, but we have to explain to our people why we cannot do other than proceed."
"Mr President, I would first like to compliment the European Parliament on its sense of timing."
"This debate on the Schwaiger report could not have come at a better time because we are right now in the middle of extremely lively discussions on the preparation of the Seattle agenda."
"Next, as the Union' s negotiator, I would like to express my pleasure at the Schwaiger report."
"Its adoption will send a clear signal to our partners' , by confirming that the European Union will not be satisfied with a minimalist approach which only aims to improve market access in some sectors."
"This would not provide a response either to our fellow citizens' concerns or to the legitimate demands of developing countries."
"Going by what you have said today, your vote tomorrow will strengthen our hand and thus the Union' s hand in Seattle."
"We are all aware that the debate on trade has changed the approach that we are taking, as the Schwaiger report shows."
"It is, admittedly, true that we want to continue to liberalise trade, which has been and still is a strategic factor in our prosperity."
"But the next round of negotiations must also address new issues, such as development, the environment, health and food safety, fundamental social standards, competition and its transparency, minimal rules in terms of investment and the promotion of cultural diversity."
"The addition of all these elements leads us to recommend a broader round of negotiations, and I am delighted to see the broad agreement on this matter between the Commission and Parliament which is shown in your report, Mr Schwaiger."
"Some of you do not agree with this approach and propose a kind of moratorium on negotiations."
"I do not think that this is a valid solution."
"Firstly because we have commitments that must be respected in the follow-up to the Uruguay Round."
"Secondly, we must carefully weigh up the risks of a moratorium."
"If we do not advance further along the route towards multilateral liberalisation, that means leaving the way open for unilateral action by the strongest."
"Is this really the outcome that those calling for a moratorium want to see?"
"Thirdly, why should we postpone negotiation on the rules which our society is rightly calling for and that developing countries are expecting in order to integrate the liberalisation of trade and sustainable development into areas such as health, the environment and workers' fundamental rights?"
"I am therefore convinced that these negotiations are necessary, but I recognise - and moreover I am delighted that this is the case - that the very conditions of these negotiations have changed in relation to the previous round."
"Given the concerns expressed by a growing number of our fellow citizens with regard to globalisation, we must have a public debate that is more wide-ranging, more transparent and more interactive."
"In this respect, I think that the discussions held when the Schwaiger report was being prepared, both within Parliament and between Parliament and the Commission, have been exemplary."
"This is why I feel I must pay tribute to Mr Schwaiger who has accomplished a Herculean task by drawing up, from your many proposals, a compromise version that I hope you will vote for tomorrow."
"In order to respond to the debate, I would like briefly to mention a few issues which have come to light in the preparation of this report."
"On the subject, first, of developing countries, it has become clear that the countries that have benefited the least from the establishment of the WTO and from the results of the Uruguay Round are also, without exception, those who are the least integrated into the world trade system."
"We therefore have to encourage their participation with a view to encouraging their integration, instead of delaying."
"Where integration does not go ahead primarily because of a lack of resources or inadequate expertise, then developing countries must be given technical and financial assistance in order to increase their negotiating ability and to apply the measures decided on within the WTO."
"On the other hand, when non-integration is a result of domestic policies or of poor development, extending deadlines for implementation or providing more and more preferential measures are not ideal solutions."
"Special and differentiated treatment is, admittedly, essential for developing countries, but it must encourage these countries to implement strategies for sustainable development and not exempt them from such strategies."
"A new approach is necessary with regard to relations with ACP countries, for example, one that must, in particular, achieve convergence towards WTO rules, because the current system must be reviewed, in any case, even if we have to make the necessary transitional changes."
"On the issue of intellectual property, we are convinced that the regulations in this field must enable developing countries to themselves benefit from the resources available to them and that the current measures already go a long way towards achieving this."
"A top-to-toe revision of the agreement would not therefore be a good idea."
"On the other hand, if we take a coherent view of the link between intellectual property and development, we must, at the same time as extending its guarantees, ensure that we encourage direct investment as the principle means of transferring technology to these countries, as well as developing agreements with them for technological cooperation and perhaps, and this is just a suggestion, thinking about strengthening European investment in fundamental research on living things, in order to share the profits with them."
"In the area of the environment, there are many concerns focusing on the applicability of environmental measures in relation to WTO rules."
"The ideal solution is to be found, of course, in multilateral negotiations on a hierarchy of norms."
"As we well know, it is not within reach."
"In the meantime, we must work hard to ensure that each of the new standards is linked to the previous ones so that, if needs be, the judges to whom disputes are referred are not given too wide a scope for interpretation."
"One of our goals is to guarantee mutual compatibility in this context, which would allow environmental or other measures to be implemented in accordance with WTO rules."
"The precautionary principle is another subject that concerns many of you."
"It is obviously up to each member of the WTO to decide if there is a risk or not."
"The precautionary principle must then allow that country to take the appropriate measures in order to avoid this risk."
"The most important thing for us therefore is the clarification of the regulations and procedures governing the application of the precautionary principle."
"As far as services are concerned, I note the concerns that have been expressed."
"I would like to reassure you on this point."
"In no case do I have the mandate to accept, by means of an international negotiation, a threat to the power of the Union' s governments to regulate these areas or to be active in them."
"We recognise the essential and crucial role that these services play in our society."
"With regard to agriculture, until now we have faced a position on the part of the Cairns group which aims to put agricultural products in the same category as other goods."
"This is not the position we hold."
"This is not what was agreed in 1994 by all parties involved and which we have respected."
"We will have to start again from the idea that agriculture has other functions apart from producing goods for the market."
"Let us finally examine the question of social standards."
"In all countries, globalisation makes its effects felt in the social sphere, but it must also be pointed out that in a number of less advanced countries, international labour standards agreed on under the International Labour Organisation are not being sufficiently respected."
"The mention of social standards arouses reactions in some of our WTO partners, particularly among developing countries, which are, and I can vouch for this, extremely heated."
"It is crucial that, from now on, we begin by restating our opposition to the imposition of trade sanctions in the social sphere as well as to any use of sanctions for protectionist reasons."
"To our mind, the very raison d' être of respecting workers' fundamental rights is the fairer distribution of profits from the growth that liberalisation of trade brings."
"It is, moreover, bearing this concern in mind, that our plan of widely applied preferences allows us to provide free-standing reductions to countries that effectively apply the main ILO conventions."
"The important thing for us in Seattle, and I think that we are all in agreement on this, is to make discussion of the matter possible in the context of cooperation between the ILO and the WTO."
"By the way, I would also like to confirm our support for the presence of Mr Somavia in Seattle as a positive sign of the importance given to this subject."
"I would like to say a word or two about China, Mr President, before I finish."
"I have not spoken publicly on this matter while I have been waiting for this debate."
"Is the signing by the Americans and the Chinese of an agreement on access to the WTO, as several of you have asked, good news or not such good news?"
"From the point of view first of those who question the whole WTO, it is not good news."
"China, a country whose development is crucial for the future of the world, is giving a clear sign that it wishes to adhere to a multilateral trade system."
"From the point of view of our multilateral interests as well as of our own interests, everything depends on the contents of the agreement that has been signed, as the American Congress wanted to be the first to hear the contents of this agreement, a procedure to which your Parliament should have been more sympathetic than hostile, even if it makes my life more difficult."
"I am sorry to say that information about the details only reaches me in dribs and drabs."
"Now the devil, or perhaps the dragon, in this case, is in the detail."
"I have no reason today to doubt the good faith of the American negotiators with whom our people have been working hard and to good effect for the last two years on our common interests."
"Nor do I have any reason to suspect that concessions on multilateral conditions that are important to us have been paid for in bilateral money that is not legal tender for us."
"Supposing that this were not the case, we should still have to negotiate with the Chinese on matters in which the Union has a particular interest."
"To sum up, it is probably good news, subject to receiving proper details of the contents, which are being prepared."
"I shall conclude my intervention Mr President, by welcoming the members of your institution who are part of our delegation to the Seattle Ministerial Conference."
"This is part of a tradition that I am happy to uphold."
"Moreover, tomorrow, I shall be meeting those MEPs that you will be appointing as delegates for Seattle, and I hope that you will have done so by tomorrow, and we will be able to discuss in greater detail the courses of action that we shall carry out once we are there."
"Mr President, I asked Mr Lamy explicitly what he thinks of Taiwan joining the WTO in the context of the Republic of China' s joining."
"He has not given me an answer."
"May I have an answer?"
"Mr President, to tell the truth, I did not answer this question because Parliament had already put it to me a few weeks ago and I answered it then."
"We are in favour of Taiwan joining the WTO."
"Furthermore, negotiations have not been entirely signed and sealed by all the countries concerned, and news of China' s rapprochement is, in fact, from this point of view, good news."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at midday."
"Mr President, this is a question which I will pose under Rule 112(2) in relation to a request for the declaration of an urgent procedure which I tabled three hours ago with regard to the Napolitano report in accordance with Rule 115, in order that the presentation of this request for an urgent debate may be announced to the House and should go ahead accordingly, so that we may respect the timetable for debate and voting which is laid down in the agenda."
"Mr Barón Crespo, I still do not have any information at the moment."
"However, we are waiting for this, and I think that what you are requesting will happen in the course of the debate which now follows."
"At the moment, I cannot tell you anything."
"Mr President, in any case I would like to make it clear that I presented this request three hours ago with my signature and that of the President of the Liberal Group and with the agreement of the President of the PPE Group, although he has not signed it."
"I would like this to appear accordingly in the Minutes."
"I would ask you to request that the services show diligence in the processing of this question."
"I take note of what you say, Mr Barón Crespo, and we shall ask the officials to deal with the matter quickly."
"Treaty reform/next IGC"
"The next item is the report (A4-0058/1999) by Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the preparations for the reform of the Treaties and for the next Intergovernmental Conference (C5-0143/1999 - 1999/2135(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to publicly thank my co-rapporteur, Mr Jo Leinen, for his cooperation."
"I believe that the report you have in front of you reflects two things in particular."
"Firstly, this report is an attempt to condense a range of views of a large majority, not only of Parliament, but of all European citizens, and secondly, it shows how the European Parliament invariably aims to play, and does indeed play, a role in taking big decisions and in procedures to further improve the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that the next Intergovernmental Conference will become directly involved in perhaps the greatest challenge facing the European Union, i.e. enlargement."
"Amongst other things, this means that the Intergovernmental Conference must aim to improve the institutions, the way in which they function and the European Union' s policies, before we can allow new members in."
"This particularly difficult process means that the next Intergovernmental Conference must proceed on a two-tier basis."
"The first tier, which I shall not say anything about since, when we divided up responsibilities, Mr Leinen assumed responsibility for that, concerns how we should introduce institutional reforms, how far we need to go with the reforms and what the actual goals of these reforms are."
"The second tier concerns the equally important issue of European Union policies."
"The European Union is having to cope with an increasingly wide range of topics on a daily basis - topics which are particularly important for the citizens of the Union."
"Clearly, it would be very difficult in the limited time we have to address them one by one in a parliamentary discussion."
"Therefore, the first issue the conference should address as regards policies is the external representation of the European Union."
"This is an issue which has quite rightly concerned us on many occasions."
"It is therefore necessary for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to aim to improve those policies which lead to a more unified European policy on security and defence."
"The second issue to be addressed, which is also an important one, concerns the future of Europe on a global scale."
"It is quite similar but it has an added dimension involving external economic relations, an issue which we have been discussing a great deal."
"The third issue, together with the economy, is that of a ""Social Europe"" ."
"It would be tragic if we forged ahead with developing European Union policies without giving consideration to such an important area which encompasses the bread and butter concerns of European citizens."
"Mr President, in such a report, we found it neither feasible nor necessary to introduce concrete political proposals."
"These proposals do exist but this report is more to do with the agenda of the IGC and how it should be followed, and contains a very specific proposal from the point of view of Parliament."
"For this reason, I am calling on you to vote in favour of the report."
"Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed this report thoroughly at several meetings, and I believe we are presenting plenum with a report of substance concerning the reform of the Treaties."
"I have my colleague, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, to thank for collaborating so well and for distributing the work in such a way that this extensive task could be carried out."
"We are agreed that, before the European Union is enlarged to include new States, there must be a basic reform to maintain the efficiency of the European Union and also, I would say, to improve the transparency of decisions on European policy and the ability to supervise these."
"We in Parliament urge that the reform now pending should go above and beyond the three Amsterdam left-overs."
"True, these are important, but they are not enough."
"I want to mention five points in connection with which demands are being made in my part of our report."
"Firstly: we demand the reform of all institutions and of all organisations including, therefore, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"All these institutions must be subjected to scrutiny."
"Central to all this is the reform of the Council."
"Parallel to the Intergovernmental Conference, the Council of Ministers must carry out an internal reform, as demanded in the Trumpf-Piris paper, and the essence of the reform must be to have majority voting in the Council as the rule and, as a concomitant of this, to have codecision making by this Parliament in the case of all legislative acts."
"I believe that Parliament will judge the Intergovernmental Conference according to whether this reform of the Council is successful."
"Secondly: the Intergovernmental Conference must make a contribution to the democratic supervision of European politics."
"Parliament must have better opportunities to supervise the Commission and to hold it to account."
"In this connection, we demand that the President of the Commission should have the ability to ask this Parliament for a vote of confidence and that the so-called Prodi procedure, whereby the President is able to dismiss a single Member of the Commission, should be incorporated into the next Treaty."
"Thirdly: we think that the reorganisation of the Treaties, leading to a situation in which the European Union would have something akin to a constitution, has now become a matter of importance."
"No citizen, and no expert either, understands the Treaties as they stand at present. They are unreadable."
"If we are to remain close to our citizens, we need to have the Treaties combined into a single text and divided into two parts - a constitutional part, and a second part which would then also partly have to be subjected to a simplified revision procedure."
"Fourthly: reform of the Treaties requires not only that these should be ambitious in content but also that a new method of reform should be employed."
"Negotiating behind closed doors should be a thing of the past. Nor is it any longer acceptable."
"Parliament must be involved in all phases of preparing for, and holding, the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We request that the Community method as per Article 48 be used; we expect a concrete proposal from the Commission which will form the basis for the negotiations; and we also expect to reach a consensus with the Council and the Commission concerning the agenda and the procedure for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"This Article 48 itself belongs on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We think that account must be taken of the European Union' s double legitimacy as a Union of States, on the one hand, but also as a Union of the Peoples on the other, while Parliament obtains the right, when it comes to future negotiations for the purpose of revising the Treaties, to participate in decision making whenever it is the content of the future Treaties which is being negotiated."
"We here in Parliament are prepared to collaborate on a comprehensive reform of the Treaties and to ensure that, even following enlargement, our European Union is still able to take necessary decisions and, at the same time, also remain transparent to our citizens so that the latter understand this Union and also accept it."
"The Commission presented its proposals last week, and now Parliament is doing the same this week."
"A lot of colleagues wanted to go much further, to the point of demanding that a European constitution be drafted."
"We have imposed a discipline upon ourselves and remained within the broad framework of what has been demanded in terms of institutional changes."
"Now, it is up to the governments, meeting in Helsinki, to have the insight and also the courage to decide upon an agenda whose subject is that of sound reform."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"(ES) Mr President, please allow me, although very briefly, to protest at the poor scheduling of such an important debate in Wednesday' s agenda."
"I pointed this out on Monday and I reiterate my protest."
"In this case I am taking the floor on behalf of the Committee on Budgets in order to mention the main points which that Committee considers to be important at the Conference on the reform of the Treaties, based on the principle that, in politics, it is a mistake to ignore budgets."
"I will list the points very briefly: the reform of the budgetary procedure, involving its updating; the extension of budgetary codecision; the integration of the peripheral institutions into the Community system; the consolidation of the financial perspective in the form of a genuine medium-term financial programme; the reform of the own resources system with a view to ensuring the financial autonomy and efficiency of the Union, on the one hand, and the transparency of the Community budget on the other, which means that there will be codecision in the determining of the overall level of own resources; the introduction of the possibility of creating fiscal instruments at a European level; the possibility that the budgetary authority may intervene every year in relation to the mix of different categories of sources of revenue; and the extension of legislative codecision and decision making by qualified majority for financial regulations in all programmes or instruments which involve Community expenditure, the CAP regulations and any act which creates an executive agency."
"Mr President, with the report of my colleagues, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, Parliament is delivering a first opinion on the tasks of the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"Without going into all the details, the framework has now been outlined for the challenge which the Europe of the near future has to meet if it is to be better understood and accepted by its citizens."
"The biggest challenge is undoubtedly presented by the enlargement of the Union, which is something we affirm and want to see."
"This enlargement to include more than 20 Member States - perhaps 30 in a number of years' time - could lead to a strengthening of the Union but also, instead, to its weakening; to its strengthening because Europe is reinforcing its identity on the basis of its political and cultural history."
"At the same time, however, such an increase in the number of actors on the European stage would throw up institutional problems and produce considerable operational weaknesses if relevant measures and radical reforms of the present system were not implemented in good time before enlargement."
"The danger of crippling the decision-making ability of the legislature - of the Council and Parliament - as well as of making the Commission unable to translate the laws into effect is a significant problem."
"A further problem lies in the difficulty of knowing how the Treaties are to be adapted to the ever more rapid development of Community realities."
"The two rapporteurs have quite correctly set out these problems and linked them to specific areas of policy."
"By means of the opinion it has delivered, the Committee on Budgetary Control wishes to answer the question of whether a further development of supervision, together with effective protection of Community finances, should be approached through the creation of a European public prosecution service, established on the basis of corpus juris but according to the spirit of subsidiarity, as also explained and clarified for us last week by Commissioner Barnier at the part-session in Brussels."
"Overall, the draft presented here points in the right direction, and I should like to acknowledge my gratitude to both rapporteurs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the historic opportunity which the coming Intergovernmental Conference is offering us to prepare the institutions and the operation of the European Union in readiness for the 21st century has already been made abundantly clear here."
"As such, the European Parliament needs to be able to take part in the preparations from close by and has to get involved in the drafting and approval of amendments to the Treaties in order to reinforce the democratic character of this procedure."
"We should also consider a possible simplification of the Treaties."
"At the Cologne European Council, it was stated that ""during the Conference, other necessary amendments to the Treaties arising as regards the European institutions and in implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, could also be discussed"" ."
"So this also includes the Court of Justice."
"In my opinion, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I emphasise that the organisational and procedural framework of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance is due for an overhaul in order to digest the current backlog. This should, in my opinion, go beyond the redistribution of chambers and increasing the number of judges."
"After all, the sound and timely administration of law forms a key component in each and every constitutional state and we need to ensure that within the European Union, the essence of the prejudicial procedure and general legal protection continue to be guaranteed."
"Other proposals which have been tabled, such as the question as to whether the European Parliament should be involved in the appointment of judges and whether the authority of the Court of Justice should extend to the third pillar, are under examination."
"So far, all Treaty amendments have increased the power for Parliament."
"This should also be the case now."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs proposes extending the codecision procedure to all areas of the internal market, with the Council still deciding by qualified majority."
"In these areas, it could even be considered whether Parliament and the Council could acquire the right of initiative with regard to amending existing legalisation."
"The introduction of a clear hierarchy of legal standards should, after all, ensure that a clear distinction can be drawn between all the various legislative and implementing decisions."
"Mr President, these were some of the first proposals tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its opinion."
"The remainder will follow in a more detailed report next year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on behalf of the Industry Committee, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their report, but I would also like to voice some criticism."
"The Industry Committee deems it extremely important that at the next review of the Treaties, improvements will be made in two areas, namely trade policy and energy."
"Regarding trade policy, the Commission' s authority to deal with the WTO or in other forums on behalf of the Community should be extended to all services and rights regarding intellectual property."
"In addition, Parliament must be able to monitor the Commission more closely, both before and during the negotiations on trade agreements."
"It may be true that the contribution of the NGOs to the negotiation process is steadily increasing, but this could never replace parliamentary control."
"Democracy cannot, and should not, be left to NGOs to deal with."
"Including sustainable development as an objective in the Treaty of Amsterdam requires an integrated approach to energy and environmental policy."
"This is why the Industry Committee is pressing for the inclusion of an energy chapter in the Treaty."
"Alongside this, the European Parliament should acquire more influence regarding the Euratom Treaty."
"Unfortunately, both rapporteurs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs refuse to adopt the amendments tabled by the Industry Committee on energy policy and Euratom."
"You will understand that I very much regret this as draftsperson of the opinion, all the more so in view of the fact that EUR 1.3 billion of research funding is tied up in the Euratom framework programme."
"This is why the liberal group has now resubmitted my amendments."
"My group supports the ambitions of the Industry Committee in terms of energy."
"Indeed, now is the time for Parliament to give the appropriate signals to the Council and the Commission for an integrated energy and environment policy."
"I do hope that the rapporteurs will still adopt these amendments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are discussing today contains Parliament' s proposals for reforming the European Union."
"This is necessary because of the forthcoming enlargement."
"The reform is also necessary, however, due to the fact that now, for the time being, eleven countries have a common monetary policy."
"This necessitates the Member States' at least pursuing their economic policies on the basis of common principles."
"The economic system prescribed in the Treaty of Rome has remained the basis of the Community' s economic policy."
"It is a system of open markets."
"In a number of Member States, one particular concept has been adopted."
"It bears the name ""social market economy"" ."
"I would recommend that this concept of the social market economy be incorporated into the Treaty."
"That is also the view of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"A significant part of the Member States' economic policy revolves around tax policy."
"Here, through Europe' s internal market, competition between the economic systems has arisen which, in the area of VAT, for example, has led to tax rates' converging."
"However, the internal market in this area is not complete because the anticipated changeover to the country of origin principle has not yet taken place."
"This is one example of why the requirement of unanimity in the Council has led to paralysis in decision making and therefore to a reduction in economic performance."
"As a result, our economic growth is lower and unemployment higher."
"That is why it is necessary, at least when it comes to the procedures for collecting taxes effective across national borders (VAT in particular), to permit qualified majority voting in the Council."
"A further problem area is Parliament' s still inadequate participation in the legislative procedures concerning competition."
"Competition is the key to our industry' s competitiveness and therefore a prerequisite for Europe' s ability to embrace the future."
"We therefore demand, where legislative procedures in this area too are concerned, that the European Parliament be involved in the decision-making process."
"What we request is that, in a number of areas in which, in full adherence to the principle of subsidiarity, the Treaties now already accord Europe a key role, the role of Parliament should be strengthened and the principle of majority voting established in the Council."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for this report."
"It will have an important part to play in preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference, and I have to say that I agree wholeheartedly with the general aims set down in the report to make the Union more effective, transparent and democratic."
"Let me speak, however, of the progress that has been made during the Finnish Presidency in preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000."
"A month ago, Prime Minister Lipponen came here to present you with an account of the outcome of the European Council in Tampere and, in so doing, he also touched on the IGC preparations."
"It is now three weeks until the Helsinki Summit conference, and IGC preparations are entering their final stage."
"Union enlargement will mean the reform of the institutional system."
"The EU must freely acknowledge the fact that enlargement will bring about the need for changes that we have to resolve within the EU."
"We must be politically courageous enough to seek far-reaching solutions and institute the reforms the Union badly needs."
"As you will certainly recall, at the Cologne Summit at the beginning of June, the next country to hold the Presidency, Finland, was charged with the task of preparing for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"During the autumn, technical IGC preparations have been made at the permanent representative level."
"Now we have moved on to the political level, and we are having bilateral discussions at different levels with the other Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Next week, Prime Minister Lipponen is to begin the traditional tour of the capitals preceding the European Council meetings."
"Preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000 are one of the main issues connected with this tour."
"The resolution by the European Parliament thus comes at exactly the right time, also in light of this tour."
"We have based these preparations on the Cologne mandate which, in practice, addresses three points in particular: the size and composition of the Commission, the re-weighting of votes in the Council and an increase in qualified majority decision making."
"The EU debate on reform has got off to a lively start, and this autumn there has been much heated discussion surrounding the IGC in the various forums."
"A month ago the Group of Wise Men, set up by Mr Prodi, published a report that called for a broad set of institutional reforms."
"On the basis of this report, the Commission last week laid down its own views on the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000, and what areas the IGC should handle."
"Here, too, in the European Parliament the Intergovernmental Conference has been on the agenda in many committee meetings."
"We are aware that there are plenty of real IGC experts among you, and we value Parliament' s contribution to the debate."
"Tomorrow you will vote on Parliament' s position on the year 2000 conference."
"I promise we shall look closely at the views you adopt then."
"The way the European Parliament participates in the Intergovernmental Conference is a very important question."
"I have heard from different quarters very positive comments on the invaluable and constructive cooperation offered by MEPs Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok with regard to the IGC in 1996."
"Regarding the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000, the Member States have not yet settled on the form the European Parliament' s participation will take."
"Preparations for the conference have included, in particular, discussions on the scope of the agenda."
"In addition to the three subject areas mentioned in the conclusions reached at Cologne, various parties have raised the following issues for debate, among others: the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, flexibility and the division of the Treaties into parts."
"We will present our own views in our report, after we have had discussions and listened to all points of view, on what we consider to be possible and desirable."
"There are many points on which all those involved in preparations for the conference are effectively united."
"Firstly, whatever opinion we have on the scope of the IGC agenda, the main theme must be enlargement and the reforms that this necessitates."
"Secondly, nobody is questioning the fact that Europe must gain strength through enlargement."
"Decision making in the European Union and its potential for action cannot be allowed to weaken as a result of enlargement."
"Thirdly, all parties involved wish to commit to a timetable, meaning that the talks would be drawn to a conclusion by the end of 2000, during the French Presidency."
"We must achieve unanimity on the reforms whilst adhering to a tight schedule, so that enlargement is not delayed due to internal problems with the timetable in the EU."
"I have focused in my speech only on the changes required by the IGC."
"We must bear in mind, however, that the institutions can also be reformed without amending the Treaties."
"In my opinion, these reforms must be carried forward coherently and effectively at the same time as the IGC."
"I venture to hope that modernising the institutions and changing the way we do things could bring the European Union and its citizens closer to one another."
"Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, has emphasised the need to improve the Union' s efficiency in its work, as well as its transparency."
"During our Presidency, we have taken a step forward in this area."
"Since its Presidency Finland has put into effect those recommendations in the Trumpf-Piris report that do not require a separate decision by the Member States."
"We have tried to improve transparency in the Council and make it easier for people to have access to documents."
"As an example of concrete action, we have made public the agendas and schedules relating to meetings of both the Council and the working parties."
"We have also made a proposal that all agendas of meetings relating to Council legislation be made public."
"This, then, has been a brief overview of the situation regarding preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000."
"Next week I will have the opportunity to discuss the matter with you in more detail when I speak in Brussels to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the progress being made in preparations for the IGC."
"We once again have before us important decisions to take on the future of the Union."
"Making these decisions and eventually implementing them will require smooth and selfless cooperation on the part of all the institutions."
"For my own part, I can confirm the Council' s desire to cooperate with the European Parliament to make the forthcoming conference a success."
"Thank you, President Sasi."
"Mr President, I believe that the applause which followed the intervention of the President of the Group of the Party of European Socialists expressed very clearly the feeling of this Parliament."
"We feel that this is not the right time to hold this debate."
"And this, Mr President, is because this debate is very important, not only for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but also for the Union in general and for those people who want Europe to be effective, more democratic and more just."
"Just the other day, another MEP asked me: ""What solutions does the European Parliament propose for the Intergovernmental Conference?"""
"And I answered in the same way as I will today, that this is not the time for solutions or proposals, but rather the time to decide what the Intergovernmental Conference is going to deal with and what method it will use in its work."
"And that is what the report drawn up by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen has done, and furthermore it has been a good illustration of how two intelligent people can reach reasonable agreements."
"I believe that the resolution tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is politically intelligent; it deals with the issues and takes a very clear and decisive political line."
"And what is that line?"
"Well, Mr President, it is one which is dictated by common sense."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam did not resolve the issue of the institutional questions facing us."
"And the signatories of the Treaty recognised this since they added a protocol, the protocol concerning the institutions in preparation for the enlargement of the European Union, specifically to see how these questions should be resolved in the future."
"That protocol envisaged a dual institutional reform."
"The first one for a European Union of less than 21 Member States and the second for when it has more: an initial mini-reform and a second broader one."
"The logic of that Protocol on the institutions tallied with the Commission' s Agenda 2000 document, which envisaged an initial enlargement which we will call 5+1."
"Now President Prodi' s new proposal breaks with this logic, because there are no longer 5+1, but rather 12 in the race."
"This new thinking has now broken with the thinking of the Protocol on the institutions."
"Therefore, that first small reform, in which we only had to consider the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council and to which the Cologne Declaration has also added the possible extension of qualified majority voting, does not make much sense and responds to a different political logic."
"Therefore we are talking about the second part of the Protocol on the institutions; we are facing a more profound reform of the European Union, which prepares it for enlargement."
"To this end, Mr President, I think that we should combine this demand, which before I called common sense, with what the President-in-Office of the Council said: that which is possible."
"But I believe that the Presidency of the Council has a great responsibility at the moment, because assessing what is possible should not prevail over the dictates of common sense."
"We already know that, as a general rule, the governments do not want to change things too much; they are happy to make do with what we have."
"However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we must push them a little bit, because otherwise, what I fear you understand to be ""what is possible"" will be too little for the needs of the European Union."
"I think that the report by Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen is full of good ideas, is absolutely reasonable and establishes the points which, in our opinion, should be considered at the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"My group, on whose behalf I am speaking, is very much in agreement with this report, but I am going to mention three amendments which may be added to it and whose vote I will request in this House:"
"My group' s Amendment No. 18 which requests that Parliament be consulted on the annual economic guidelines, the decisions involving budgetary short-falls and any other important decision which has to be taken within the framework of European Economic and Monetary Union, of course leaving to one side the independence of the European Central Bank."
"It seems to me that this is an issue that this Parliament should be involved in."
"Amendment No. 26 in which we also incorporate, with regard to the distribution of competences, the principle of subsidiarity."
"And finally any of the Amendments, Nos. 47, 26, 27 or 28, which talk of flexibility."
"I believe that we should open the debate on flexibility."
"But all of this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, should take into account an essential element: we should not forget what the European Community has meant over all these years nor the thing which is most important to the Community, which is the principle of integration."
"That is what we have to preserve and that, if we do not carry out the appropriate reforms, will be very difficult to preserve in a Europe of 28."
"Thank you, Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"Mr President, first of all, in relation to the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, I would like to welcome the work of the rapporteurs, who I believe have produced a piece of work which reflects not only our concerns but also an approach which is very pertinent and reasonable with regard to the objectives which the Union must have."
"The intention is to set a sensible attitude on the part of the Council, which would try to resolve what remains after Amsterdam, against a sort of Christmas card on the part of Parliament."
"I would like to say that Parliament, as it did before the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, has opted for a line which consists of a short and precise list dealing with fundamental issues."
"I believe that our ambition should be, firstly, to create a Union that works well and, secondly, we should be in a position to enlarge that Union."
"It is simple: we cannot say that we need a small reform when this Union was designed for six and now, thanks to its success, has fifteen Members and we are willing to allow 25 or 30."
"This cannot be sorted out by moving the furniture around. We will have to take a radical approach."
"Therefore, I understand that the fundamental questions - and I have listened attentively to the President-in-Office of the Council - will raise other questions and this requires an Intergovernmental Conference, which must be sufficiently ambitious."
"The second comment I wanted to make, Mr President, relates to the method."
"We talk a lot about transparency and contact with the citizens."
"It is difficult enough to explain an Intergovernmental Conference to them, but it is even more difficult to explain it if it is done behind closed doors."
"At a time when we are trying to popularise the Euro and gain greater support for the Union, and when the Council - and I welcome this initiative - is embarking on the task of writing up and debating a Charter of Fundamental Rights with the participation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it seems rather shocking that a closed door procedure is being considered in which the Council has still not said whether the European Parliament will be represented."
"I draw your attention to this issue because it seems absolutely contradictory and opposed to our own interests and needs."
"We have to open up to civil society, we have to involve national parliaments and there must be an open debate within Parliament, otherwise it will be very difficult to gain sufficient support."
"And the third consideration, Mr President, concerns the tasks which face us, because they cannot be left until the end of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We are carrying out a reform of our institution, for example with the work on the Statute for Members - and I welcome the Council' s good will - and also the reform of our Rules of Procedure."
"The Commission is committed to a reform programme."
"I believe that the Council - which of all our institutions is, in a way, the one which has been most fragmented by the increase in specialised Councils and a myriad of related committees - must lead by example. But it should not only think of the future but also of the need for a democratic and effective Community."
"To this end, I welcome the words of the President-in-Office of the Council and I hope that, while we prepare the Conference, we are capable of advancing along this road."
"Mr President, this IGC will be supported by two parallel processes: the brave new world of a European defence policy and the defining of European citizenship within the drafting of the charter."
"I trust that these separate but closely related processes will galvanise the IGC, just as the drive towards the single currency stimulated the Maastricht conference."
"We certainly need stirring up."
"At present, despite the good work of the rapporteurs, Parliament' s draft position is in danger of being more conservative than the Commission' s, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled various amendments to seek to sharpen the focus of the report and to speed up the development of a parliamentary Europe."
"Firstly, we want a real process of conciliation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in preparing the IGC."
"Secondly, we wish to change the Treaty revision procedure in those areas where power is already transferred to the European level."
"It is crazy for us to be obliged to undergo this ponderous and protracted Treaty revision procedure when we wish merely to reform a common policy."
"It is also wrong for Parliament to be excluded from that process."
"Thirdly, we wish to improve access of the citizen to the European Court so that the citizen will be a privileged litigant with ourselves, Member States and companies."
"Fourthly, we want a further look at the flexibility clauses so that certain Member States are able in practice to deepen their relationship without threatening the acquis."
"I commend the Liberal proposals to Parliament."
"Mr President, here we are on the eve of a new round of reforms and the umpteenth Intergovernmental Conference."
"Unlike the Millennium Round, we have still not managed to stimulate public opinion, non-governmental organisations or even the MEPs on this subject, which remains fairly far removed from the thoughts of all of us."
"However, we have an opportunity and we must make the most of it."
"On the other hand - as emphasised in the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, whom I would like to thank here - we are talking about how to turn this muddled machine into a modern democracy, how rights, policies and decisions can be made transparent to everyone and how this European home can become more open and welcoming."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament has decided to embark upon the process of revision and the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Frankly, I do not know if we shall succeed."
"Parliament is in a position of objective weakness in the dialogue with the governments, and it is therefore not very easy."
"My group considers, however, that some things must be explained more clearly and has tabled some amendments to this end, which I hope will arouse the interest of this House."
"The governments must not be the European Parliament' s only partners in dialogue - as they often are for the Commission - and Parliament must therefore try to open and introduce a perspective of a, shall we say, constitutional nature, so that the instruments for an efficient democracy are clear for all and not just for a few specialists."
"As for the method, we do not believe that sending two observers is sufficient: two MEPs who observe a diplomatic conference and who, furthermore, are bound by an obligation of discretion, cannot be anything other than an alibi displaying weakness and modest ambitions."
"If the objective is to start the intergovernmental process, we must move towards a political agreement on the contents of the reform between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Secondly, the agenda must not be restricted to technical points and to the issues not settled in Amsterdam."
"Codecision with the European Parliament and majority voting must become the rule, even in difficult sectors such as agriculture and taxation."
"The citizens must emerge from the fog they now find themselves in."
"Besides, I wonder, why mention specifically in the report the need to keep unanimous voting?"
"There is no need."
"What we want today is greater democracy, greater codecision and majority voting in the Council."
"There is no point in reassuring the governments: they do not need to be reassured because it is they who decide in the end."
"Finally, Mr President, even if today talking about defence is very fashionable, my group, albeit with its differing opinions, is convinced that discussing security in an exclusively military context is not positive."
"At the Intergovernmental Conference, if discussions are limited to the best way to integrate fifteen armies, then they will hold very limited interest."
"We think that we will only be able to talk about security and defence within the context of a general communitisation and democratisation of foreign policy."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteurs."
"They have certainly carried out a complicated and difficult piece of work."
"I think that Parliament, as the representative of our citizens, will continue to have some intensive work to do within the framework of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference so that it might in actual fact do justice to the high expectations of people both in the European Union and also in the applicant States."
"Our Group will actively involve itself in the debate by making a number of proposals of its own."
"We are fighting above all for the creation of a genuinely social and democratic Europe, a Europe which retains the European model of the social State, a Europe in which public services are not deregulated away and in which everything is done to prevent social dumping."
"It is clear to us that the Amsterdam left-overs ought not to remain the only subjects of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In view of the enlargement which we all want to see, the European Union and its Member States must finally summon up the courage to undertake radical reforms so that a still politically divided Europe might grow together democratically and in terms of the social contract between citizens."
"What is unsettling, indeed thoroughly alarming, is what has been set in motion in the field of foreign and security policy and the vehemence with which hitherto civil European integration is being shelved and a military Union is being created."
"In Parliament' s report, for example, it is proposed that the European Union must finally acquire the ability to act - an ability to act based upon credible military resources."
"I would ask you all, please, what are credible military resources supposed to include."
"Personnel mines, tanks or even nuclear weapons?"
"On Monday, in Brussels, the foreign and defence ministers defined where we are headed."
"This was an historic step."
"By 2003, a rapid strike force is to be created under the umbrella of the EU, in effect a European army of 50,000 men for crisis operations in and around Europe."
"Yesterday, the German daily newspaper, ""Die Welt"" characterised the plans as follows: the traditional defence of Europe would remain solely the responsibility of NATO; the EU strike force is not to compete with it but instead become its new trump card."
"Against this background, our Group had already submitted a motion to the Committee to the effect that the European Union should repudiate war as a means of solving international conflicts."
"I find it downright incomprehensible that this proposal should not have found majority support in the Committee."
"Our Group will again submit this motion tomorrow in the Plenum."
"We shall request a roll-call vote for we are of the opinion that citizens are entitled to know who in this Chamber regards war as legitimate."
"Mr President, the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take a stand on two interrelated issues."
"One is the issue of the so-called institutional triangle, a question that was not answered in Amsterdam. The other issue concerns enlargement into Eastern Europe."
"Firstly, it is crucial that the reform that is drafted is democratic and that it has a democratising effect. In other words, that it subordinates bureaucrats to elected officers and subordinates the latter to public opinion in each country, and that its democratic legitimacy is strengthened through the participation of national parliaments and is not replaced by organisations of dubious representativeness or by supposed wise men."
"Secondly, we are fighting for an institutional reform in which there is a balance, not just between the Community institutions, but between the Member States, and for this balance to be expressed in the durability of this reform."
"We therefore think that adopting new federal powers at Union level will do nothing more than highlight this imbalance and increase the distance between the Union and its constituent peoples, as happens a little with each reform - and the high rates of abstention throughout Europe in the European elections show this to be true."
"We are also opposed to the idea of the constitutionalisation of the Treaties as well as to the integration of a future Charter of Fundamental Rights in some kind of European constitutional process because we still think that European citizenship merely complements national citizenship and that therefore, the definition of the duties and fundamental rights of each nation' s citizens falls to the citizens of that nation."
"Respect for the European people' s will leads us to state with complete conviction the need to institutionalise the Luxembourg compromise."
"We do not really see how we can increase the range of matters that can be decided by qualified majority unless the Member States, especially the smallest, have the means to oppose them by invoking their pre-eminent national interest."
"Mr President, we share the conviction that with the forthcoming enlargement into Eastern Europe, the Union can continue to create the right conditions for the States to enrich each other instead of causing the ruin of some in order to give others more help in succeeding."
"We think that the economy and the competitiveness of European countries can be developed in a context that favours the modernisation of social systems without giving up the fundamental requirement of solidarity."
"We even think that Europe could acquire an external political dimension which matches its economic importance, and that this can be done whilst respecting the national interests of each Member State."
"However, the construction of Europe does not mean taking away from peoples and nations the scope for autonomy that enables them to control their own destiny."
"By this I mean that we can only undertake this construction if we support respect for national sovereignty, if we support approval by the people, social and political consensus, the openness and transparency of the processes and respect for all the constituent countries."
"Mr President, the essence of democracy is being able to go to the polls and obtain a new majority and subsequently a new law."
"Laws are not sacred cows."
"They are texts which can be changed by a new majority in Parliament."
"The voters always have the final say."
"That is the case in all our countries but, when we legislate in the Community, democracy goes by the board, so that the voters no longer have the final say where the laws are concerned."
"Officials and ministers have taken over from the legislature."
"Each new majority decision in the EU is an erosion of parliamentary democracy, and that is why, yesterday, we set up an intergroup for parliamentary democracy."
"Its working title is SOS Democracy or Democracy First, and we shall be gathering people together from every group for the purpose of securing democracy in the next Treaty and of bringing about complete openness within the EU."
"The intergroup is broadly based, its members ranging from British Conservatives to left-wing socialists."
"We have members from all political groups in this Chamber."
"We vote differently here on most questions, but we are in agreement about the fact that our differences should be settled in democratically elected parliaments and among the electorate."
"Officials and ministers should not decide which of us are right."
"We do not accept that a Commission in Brussels should decide whether or not elected representatives of the people can receive a proposal for debate."
"We certainly cannot accept that the EU Executive should now be preparing for another Intergovernmental Conference whose essential aim is to shift power from the voters and their elected representatives to behind the closed doors of offices in Brussels."
"There is a need for SOS Democracy because democracy comes first."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency of the Council, together with Mr Sasi, for the commitment with which they are approaching this difficult task of establishing a mandate and also say thank you to the rapporteurs for the really excellent work which is being done."
"I should also like, however, at the same time, to point out to Mrs Kaufmann, who has just quoted the class enemy' s newspaper, ""Die Welt"" , that the party to which she has belonged was the only German party following the Second World War to issue the order for a war of aggression, namely against Czechoslovakia, and so one might do well to refrain from making remarks such as she has made."
"This Intergovernmental Conference has a very difficult timetable to comply with, for the Conference must be completed within the period prescribed, so ensuring that enlargement of the European Union is not delayed. At the same time, it must equip the European Union for the enlargement."
"In other words, it is subject to strict time limits and is faced with a great challenge."
"Equipping the Union in this way means tackling not only the Amsterdam left-overs but also many questions concerned with foreign and security policy, a lot of issues which my colleague Karl von Wogau may have addressed in relation to monetary union, and much more besides."
"The question of majority voting is the key issue for the success of this Conference if our European Union is to be in shape for enlargement and if our European Parliament is also to agree to enlargement."
"There must therefore be clear definitions in a range of areas as to where majority voting is necessary."
"There must be majority voting in the field of tax policy, but not where all taxes are concerned."
"There must be majority voting in the field of social policy, but not for social policy in its entirety."
"This must be clearly laid down, just as it must be made clear that, when it comes to the European Parliament' s participating in decision making on agricultural policy, not all agricultural policy really constitutes legislation in any material sense, but only a small proportion - perhaps 20 or 30 - of the 3,000 legal documents."
"In those areas, however, Parliament must obtain the right to participate in decision making and, in addition, the right to full decision-making powers where the agricultural budget is concerned."
"In the field of structural policy, it is, for example, becoming clear that the more Member States there are, the less likely it is that we shall make sensible decisions on the basis of the principle of unanimity and so ensure that scarce funds and resources are invested in such a way that they benefit the really poor regions and poor groups of this European Union."
"In the area of foreign and security policy, too, we need rights of supervision, but we must find out - in the framework of implementing the Cologne decisions - which areas may still lead to changes to the Treaty."
"Here, I should like to mention in particular that incorporation of the WEU into the European Union cannot be agreed before Article 5 has also been put in order."
"Out of consideration for our neutral Members, Article 5 may only, however, be regularised in the framework of a protocol to the Treaty so that each country can decide for itself whether or not it wants to accede to this part."
"I do not believe that the European Union essentially needs new powers but, in connection with the powers it has, it needs the tools really to avail itself of these."
"Only then would we be in a position to combine transparency, efficiency and democracy, for these three things combined are the conditions of acceptance by the population of Europe."
"As proposed in the Dehaene report, the Council of Ministers would be divided, as part of this process, into an Executive Council of Ministers, which could meet behind closed doors, and a Legislative Council of Ministers, which would have to meet in public."
"For it is not acceptable in a democratic community that a legislative body should shut itself away from the population."
"This is a unique situation in the world and it is no longer acceptable."
"I therefore think that the proposal to divide up the Treaties, as presented by Mr Dehaene, is important."
"In the spirit of transparency and efficiency, we ought to combine the constitutional parts of the Treaty, including the regulations relating to the powers which can be exercised, and combine the remaining parts in another Treaty of lower status."
"This too is important so that citizens can see how this Europe of ours is organised."
"Here, there may perhaps in the longer term be a point of contact with the convention which is to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this convention might perhaps develop into a constituent assembly, for a constitutional Treaty must be the goal for which we are striving in the longer term."
"Mr President, my group welcomes this report, mainly because of two key points that it contains."
"Firstly, it makes the case for a wider IGC than the three so-called Amsterdam left-overs."
"Although those are key points, crucial points, we believe that it is right that the IGC ranges beyond just those three issues."
"This view is indeed gaining ground, thanks partly to the Dehaene report and the Commission' s own proposals - and I pay tribute to Mr Barnier who is here with us - but it is also gaining ground and rightly so among the national governments."
"Nobody wants an all encompassing IGC dealing with every subject facing the Union in the Maastricht style, but there is a strong case to add to the agenda half a dozen key subjects which must be resolved if our Union is to work efficiently, transparently and democratically and is to be capable of facing up to having nearly 30 Member States."
"The second reason is that it makes the case for more democratic procedures."
"Amsterdam was already better than previous IGCs to a limited degree, in that it was prepared by a reflection group in which Parliament participated and which published its full report, in that every proposal tabled in that IGC was published and put into the public domain and in that Parliament was able to send two representatives to at least some of the meetings."
"The time has now come, though, to be able to send Parliamentary representatives to all the meetings and to participate in the IGC on the same basis as the Commission, as a Community institution, to make our case, to advocate our proposals and at times to argue against the proposals made by others."
"Mr President, my group has tabled only two amendments and two requests for a split vote on this report."
"That is because in the main we think this report strikes the right balance between ambition and realism."
"One amendment seeks to re-establish in the report a request that the IGC should re-examine the issue of flexible cooperation."
"It is unthinkable that we should move to nearly 30 Member States without the IGC re-examining that question."
"With nearly thirty Member States we need a clause on flexible cooperation that is actually workable."
"The second amendment looks at the issue of having two parts to the Treaty: the constitutional part, looking at the main principles and the institutional provisions, and the small print dealing with policies."
"This idea has widespread support."
"Views differ, however, as to whether that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure."
"Our amendments suggest that sections of that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure - maybe not all of it, that may cause insurmountable problems, but at least part of it."
"There are many cases in the existing Treaties - different protocols, parts of the European Coal and Steel Treaty for instance - that are amendable by simplified procedure and the IGC should look constructively at this."
"Mr President, the Treaties are the European Union' s constitution."
"They need to be made clearer, more transparent, more effective and more democratic."
"The IGC must take on board that challenge."
"Mr President, when, on 9 November 1989, freedom-loving people climbed over the Iron Curtain, history was changed dramatically."
"It finally became possible to unify Europe and to create a broad, pan-European partnership, founded upon freedom and democracy."
"A week ago, we commemorated the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"The tenth anniversary reminded us that it is high time that we got to grips with the enlargement of the European Union and sped up the process."
"It has already taken far too long."
"For us liberals, there is nothing more important than creating a unified Europe in which we solve problems together in a civilised way."
"Enlargement of the EU is a moral imperative."
"Enlargement, but also the fact that our citizens have a crisis of confidence in the EU, are factors which demand reforms of, and changes to, the European institutions."
"All too many people feel that the EU does not engage hearts and minds."
"The mistrust is sometimes almost palpable."
"We need to take this state of affairs very seriously."
"The Intergovernmental Conference ought therefore to have the ambition of thoroughly reforming the EU institutions."
"Simplification, openness, clarity and public scrutiny must be the watchwords."
"If a Union of 30 members is going to be able to function, it must concentrate on the genuinely cross-border questions and only act in those areas where European cooperation produces the best results."
"A careful review of the division of labour is required, and this will require courage and a willingness to roll up our sleeves and set to work, in other words vision but also pragmatism."
"The debate ought not however to be carried on in isolation behind closed doors."
"All democratic forces must be involved and citizens must have the opportunity to participate and say their piece."
"They are entitled to expect results and also to demand that they be achieved."
"If we fail in this, they may perhaps turn away from the European project, which would be a major catastrophe."
"Mr President, is our Parliament really aware of what is at stake in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference?"
"Sometimes I doubt it."
"When I see, in the text of the report, that we are capable of pushing absurdity to the point of deliberately limiting the number of our own representatives at the debating table to two, I say to myself, there are definitely some people in this Chamber who are scared of their own shadow."
"This IGC, however, opens up a narrow historical window enabling what is essential to meet up with what is possible."
"Because, in the face of the challenges that the new century will present, morally we do not have the right to be satisfied with the off-cuts of institutional reform that are the left-overs from Amsterdam."
"Codecision must become the general rule."
"Our Parliament must obtain, as in any democracy worthy of the name, full budgetary authority over expenditure as well as over revenue."
"We must equip Europe with the tools of equity, security and solidarity."
"Let us say it: it is high time that we committed our continent to a constituent process."
"The only real limiting factor is not our democratic imagination, it is our House' s political will."
"And if we were not really capable of freeing ourselves from the yoke of the current regulations, then any further reform would become impossible."
"Without real reforms, Europe, which is often helpless with fifteen Members, will be sterile when it has thirty."
"As Commissioner Barnier understands perfectly well, today' s developments must facilitate tomorrow' s developments."
"And who else but us, MEPs elected by direct universal suffrage by the European people, could have greater legitimacy for conducting and concluding this tremendous process."
"Parliaments often vote on laws, but more rarely do they write history."
"Because this honour has been granted to us today, I ask that we prove worthy of it. I ask that we show political courage."
"Mr President, the turnout at this year' s election for the European Parliament fell in almost all Member States where other elections had not been arranged at the same time."
"If seats were to be left empty in this Chamber to represent all those who did not vote, 322 places would be unoccupied."
"This just goes to prove that democratic support for the European Parliament is weaker than that for the national parliaments."
"In spite of that, the report which we are discussing proposes that precisely these national parliaments are to lose a very great deal more influence over both their own national policies and over the EU' s treaties and policies."
"Power is to be transferred to bodies for which democratic support is weaker, for example, the European Parliament, or else non-existent, for example the Commission or the European Court of Justice."
"We on the Nordic left are therefore going to vote against most parts of the motion for a resolution which demands, among other things, that more decisions should be made at supranational level, that national influence over the Treaty should be limited and that the dominance of the big States should be increased."
"Mr President, the turn-out at the elections in June illustrated that Europe' s citizens are still too far removed from the European Union."
"Strangely enough, many still fail to learn any lessons from this."
"The greatest enlargement of the Union is pending, but with this report, Parliament is further progressing towards reinforced integration in Europe."
"Nobody has given me any arguments as to why a stronger Europe should involve its citizens more in policy."
"This report should turn the IGC into a success, but it overlooks the notions which are fundamental to Europe' s future."
"A thorough discussion regarding subsidiarity is urgently needed."
"This is why we have resubmitted the amendment on this topic."
"Only the clear demarcation of the Union' s tasks is a basis for a correct distribution of power."
"The policy should be drafted as closely to Europe' s citizens as possible."
"We welcome a broad IGC agenda, although it is difficult to tie up the loose ends of Amsterdam."
"The right of veto for matters which affect national sovereignty remains necessary."
"We find it unacceptable that enlargement would be postponed because the Union has not put its own house in order."
"This enlargement is the very reason why a dynamic approach should be adopted."
"We do not deem it necessary for there to be a proposal from the Commission for the IGC agenda; they have more than enough to deal with."
"Following consultation with the Commission, it is up to the Council to draft this agenda and to make its own preparations."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office Mr Sasi for the comments he made earlier on during this debate."
"Firstly, he confirmed the continued cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament and his forthcoming visit to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"But he also confirmed that in the IGC enlargement would remain at the core, at the heart of the envisaged Treaty reforms and, secondly, that the timetable would be adhered to."
"I believe both of those are important aspects."
"First of all, on enlargement, we are talking here about enlargement of a very different scale and nature to anything that has happened before, and that has implications for the nature of the IGC which prepares for it."
"We are talking in the main about countries from Central and Eastern Europe which have enjoyed, as we all know, 40 years of dictatorship when civil society was emasculated, driven underground and destroyed."
"Although ten years have elapsed and great strides have now been made, I believe that a good deal of confidence-building is still required and that we need the openness that many of us have called for in the preparation and the implementation of these reforms."
"As the IGC takes place there are two aspects, therefore, that we in the European Parliament should remember."
"One is that in the past, IGCs have not prepared public opinion until the Treaty reforms had actually been agreed, particularly in reference to Maastricht."
"This had unfortunate consequences in a number of Member States."
"I believe we should learn the lessons from that mistake of the past and realise that the importance of this particular enlargement, the re-uniting of the European family, is something which our public at home needs to be made aware of while the IGC is actually taking place."
"And I believe that openness should also extend to the applicant countries themselves."
"It would be most unfortunate if we as the institutions of the EU saw this merely as a bureaucratic or a constitutional exercise to our own interest and our own advantage."
"It is specifically for the purpose of enlargement that openness is necessary."
"Therefore I believe that, where possible, not only should our own domestic public opinion be engaged at all stages but also the public opinion of the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"I appreciate that that is a break in tradition from the nature of a governmental conference as we understood it in the past."
"But as I say, this is a very different type of IGC and therefore we have to be imaginative in the way that we present ourselves to the public."
"Mr President, this report has won the consensus of a large majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"In my opinion, this is a significant confirmation of those shared Europeanist objectives that have, in the past, characterised the European Parliament in its relations with the other Community institutions, with national parliaments and public opinion."
"We have played - and we have shown that we wish to continue playing - an important part in supporting the process of European integration, and its continual and coherent development."
"The political tensions that characterised the start of this parliamentary term are therefore not obstructing the necessary agreements between various, important - the most important - parliamentary groups on the subject of consolidating the Union, its institutions and its policies."
"It is important to agree, at this time, on the proposal that must be drawn up on the reform of the Treaties, on the convening of the new Intergovernmental Conference and on the drawing up of the agenda and the method."
"The positions taken in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report have been supported by those in the communications by President Prodi and Mr Barnier on behalf of the European Commission, explained to Parliament the day after the vote in our committee."
"This is now a sure point, which everyone must take into account: Parliament and the Commission are moving in the same direction and are equally convinced that the Intergovernmental Conference must not restrict itself to a limited horizon, simplified guidelines or a minimal agenda."
"The wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed that Parliament is concerned with being, at the same time, far-sighted and realistic, demanding and practical."
"We should stop seeing Parliament as if it were advancing goodness knows what dangerous demands and impossible requests."
"Our proposals are not a reflection of an abstract scheme and are not a luxury, but reflect objective, inescapable requirements for a comprehensive reform of the institutions of the Union."
"We need to go beyond Amsterdam and look further in order to be able to realise the historic commitment to enlarging eastwards, and to guarantee further progress in the integration process that is working against the risks of dilution and stagnation."
"No one can overlook the problems of strengthening the political side of Europe and institutional change but, in addition to this, we have had to deal with the launch of the euro and the European Central Bank, the lesson to be learnt from Kosovo, the widespread aspiration for a guaranteed area of security and justice and the disenchantment of too many European voters."
"This is an appeal we are making, in particular, to governments and national parliaments, with whose assistance we must build a stronger, more united and more democratic Europe."
"Mr President, thank you for having given me the floor for a few moments at this point in the debate during which I have been able to listen closely to the rapporteurs whom I had already heard, but also to the representatives and the speakers of the different groups that sit in Parliament, that is to say, many of you."
"I hope that the speakers I will not be able to hear due to the way this debate has been re-organised as well as to the constraints of my own schedule, will forgive me."
"I can only promise them that I shall remain attentive to what is said throughout the debate today and of course later."
"Honourable Members, Mr President, institutional reform is not a political project."
"It is a tool."
"Our project, as many of you have said, and it underlies our thoughts today, is the uniting of the peoples of European States in a political, economic, social and cultural Community."
"The great political project for the very start of the next century is therefore the welcoming of many new Members."
"This is why the distinction made in Amsterdam between limited adjustment, minor enlargement and a broader reform is already an outdated distinction."
"You are already aware of the Commission' s contribution to the preparation for this Conference."
"I am delighted today, as was President Prodi, to see the contribution your Parliament has made and to note, and I would like to thank your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen most sincerely for this, a broad convergence of views, at this stage, between our two institutions."
"And I think that this convergence of views is a major trump card that we should hold on to both in terms of the issues at stake in the reform and of the working method that we should adopt."
"I would like to say a few words about the issues involved in this reform."
"As your two rapporteurs so aptly emphasised, this forthcoming Conference must concentrate on institutional issues, on all institutional issues with the notable and politically necessary exception of the discussions currently taking place on a European security and defence policy."
"I think that if institutional reforms are to succeed, they must be placed, and I say this to you, bearing in mind my experience of the last negotiations, in a broader political perspective, and they must together attempt to provide an answer to the fundamental question, ""How should we speak to each other?"
"How should we work?"
"How should we move forward and take decisions in a Union which will contain 27 countries?"" Because that is what there will be around the table."
"And that is the only question that we should be asking as we seek answers, all the answers, whichever institutions and processes are affected by seeking this answer."
"The first issue that we have identified together is that of functioning well when there is a large number of states."
"Just now, I heard the President-in-Office of the Council mention enlargement which, he said, means ""change"" ."
"And, in direct response, I shall reply to him that what we are dealing with is a major enlargement, not a minor adjustment."
"And we must respond to this major enlargement with real reform which must first, therefore, address the decision-making process."
"This is why I believe that the majority of us will agree on making it clear that qualified majority voting within the Council should become the rule, with exceptions limited to a few fundamental and very sensitive issues."
"As many of you wanted us to, we have also put it in writing that where an issue of a legislative nature is concerned, the qualified majority must be linked to a codecision procedure between the Council and the European Parliament."
"The second issue is that of developing the Treaties."
"I mentioned this idea during my hearing in your Parliament."
"It has been taken up and stressed in the report by Jean-Luc Dehaene, President von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon and it merits being dealt with in more depth."
"It consists in fact of reorganising the Treaties by separating the basic texts on the one hand and the implementing provisions on the other."
"This reorganisation would allow the Treaties to continue to develop because the implementing provisions could, if necessary, one day be amended by a simplified procedure."
"I think that this new revision procedure could contribute towards linking the European Parliament more closely with the revision of the Treaties."
"I would like to say however that I do not think that this reorganisation should lead to a change in the Union' s or the Community' s current competences."
"Another point is the representation of the States in the Council."
"The decisions of the Council should be more representative of the relative weight that the Union' s different Member States carry."
"Whilst respecting the spirit and the balance of the Treaty of Rome, decision making itself should also be made easier."
"And then there are the other institutions."
"With enlargement, we will have to define the number of elected representatives from each State within your Parliament."
"The Commission, with its power to issue guidelines, the new authority conferred on its President, will have to preserve - I hope you do not mind if I say that it will not be easy, now that I am a Member of the Commission - its collegial character, its efficiency, and its decision-making process which requires a simple majority of its Members."
"The Court of Justice or the Court of Auditors will have to adapt to enlargement."
"By mentioning all of these institutions, I am attempting to show that there are many answers to the fundamental question that I raised just now, that is, how we will work when there are 27 of us, and these are answers that must be looked into at this Intergovernmental Conference."
"The functioning of the institutions does not necessarily imply a revision of the Treaties."
"In their daily work, there are important reforms of internal structures for the European Parliament, for the Commission and especially for the Council, which must be implemented before enlargement."
"The second major issue, Mr President, is to prevent the risk of dilution; the risk of dispersion that enlargement entails for us all."
"I repeat that when a risk presents itself, it can either be overcome, accepted as if it were inevitable, or prevented."
"We hope to prevent this risk of dispersion."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam has established the legitimacy of certain forms of cooperation between Member States within the Union' s institutional framework in order to move beyond the level of integration that has already been achieved."
"On behalf of the Commission, I shall say quite clearly that the acquis must, under no circumstances, be considered to be a form of strengthened cooperation between the Fifteen Member States."
"The objective is really to improve the current conditions of strengthened cooperation and to make them easier."
"If we do not achieve this at this Conference, the current right of veto would only encourage the States that would like to achieve a deeper level of cooperation between themselves not to do it within the Community framework but to do it more and more outside this framework."
"In order to strengthen the Union' s coherence, the Commission, like your Parliament, hopes that the question of the Union' s external representation will also be raised."
"The third issue is that of continuing the political construction of Europe and, when the moment comes, we will then have to accept the consequences for the institutions of the work in progress on the Common Security and Defence Policy."
"We are not forgetting that there is also the question of the way the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the Treaty."
"I would like to bring this intervention to a close by thanking you for your attention and by mentioning the preparations for the negotiations."
"Our objective is to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion and to achieve this before the end of the year 2000 with significant results."
"Our objective is not to delay enlargement but to accomplish it successfully."
"This is why we hope that the procedure laid down by the Treaty, in Article 48, is implemented as soon as possible after Helsinki."
"I would also like to express our agreement to the involvement of the European Parliament taking place in the best possible conditions, with greater participation than there was, as I can testify, when we were preparing for Amsterdam."
"I would finally like to say that this reform throughout the year 2000 must provide the opportunity for genuine public debate between us, the institutions, but also with national parliaments and with our citizens."
"It is our place, and indeed my own, to see to it that we take part in this public debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is convinced that powerful institutional reform, adapted to the requirements of enlargement, can be achieved before the end of 2000."
"We know that the Union will emerge from this enlargement completely transformed."
"It must not emerge from it weakened."
"But we will only succeed if this reform is achieved with sufficient ambition and political will, which means that many of us will have to give priority to the long-term vision over caution or national interests."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order."
"I heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is intending to leave, that he needs to go early because he has other commitments."
"Can I just say that I was minister in my own country for five years but not a single minister in our parliament would have considered walking out on a debate where spokespersons were still waiting to speak."
"Mrs de Palacio, who is responsible for relations with Parliament, has also promised - at least in our Group - that Commissioners will remain present in all debates from now on."
"The last speakers are just as important as the first ones. They may even have more voters behind them than the first ones."
"I urge Mr Barnier to respect Parliament and to stay."
"Otherwise I would ask you to write to Mr Prodi to observe the agreements with Mrs de Palacio."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Maij-Weggen."
"In any event, the Commissioner has said that he will be with us until eight o' clock."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen does not take adequate account of the fact that the European Union is fast taking on pan-European proportions."
"A decision may be taken at the Helsinki Summit to expand talks to include twelve countries. When official applicant country status is accorded to Turkey too, we may soon be receiving new applications for membership from the Balkans region and elsewhere."
"In the plenary part-session in October, I said that the conflict between EU expansion and deepening could only be solved by the internal reorganisation of the Union on the onion skin model, or a system of concentric circles."
"I proposed that the whole Union should develop as an association of states, but its core should develop into a full-fledged federation."
"I proposed that the outer circle of cooperation and integration would be the European Council, to which we could give new duties."
"I am glad that this idea of mine has met with a positive response in principle."
"It has not had time, however, to be reflected in the amendments that our Group has tabled for this report."
"For my own part, I cannot support the report by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen."
"It is an attempt to continue to develop the Union into a federation, and it in no way takes account of how the robust enlargement process should influence the Union' s institutional development."
"Mr President, one of the founders of the current European Union said that, if they were to begin European construction again, they would start this time with a consideration of the people and their cultures."
"But the European Union, far from rectifying the situation, seems to abide by the theory expounded by Livy, that is to say, it forgets what has happened and therefore can complain but cannot put anything right."
"In the texts which have been proposed for the reform of the Treaties and the next IGC, not even with the most powerful magnifying glass can we find a sentence which refers to the European peoples and regions and the role that they should play in the Europe of the future."
"It is time for the regional question to occupy the place that it deserves."
"The European parties which are stuck in the past have shown that they are incapable of overcoming the short-sightedness which makes them blind to the internal national and regional realities of the current Member States."
"When will we talk about nations such as Scotland, Wales, Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque country, which are not even allowed to sit together with the Governments on the Council?"
"What is going to be done about regions such as Andalucia - with 7.5 million inhabitants - which is treated like a second class country, while representatives of Member States which are a twentieth the size sit in the Council?"
"New countries are going to join the Union, some of which are very small and we are in favour of their accession, but if it were not for their recent emancipation, they would not be candidates for Membership."
"The accession of these new countries, Mr President, will mean the under-representation of internal nations and regions of the current States."
"García Márquez said that wisdom comes when we no longer have any use for it."
"Let us hope that this is not the case with our political vision and sensitivity towards the role of the nations and regions of Europe!"
"Mr President, in this debate on the agenda and procedures for the upcoming IGC, I would first of all like to express that I, like the rapporteur, would advocate taking a wider approach, at least wider than proposed at the Cologne Summit."
"The reasons have been spelt out loud and clear."
"During this Summit, the accession, in the short-term, of four or five countries from Central and Eastern Europe was discussed. This number has since grown to ten or twelve."
"This has the immediate effect that a root-and-branch reform should be undertaken and this is more than a few institutional reforms."
"As far as I can see, there are six points to this argument."
"Firstly, there are the institutional reforms as planned in Cologne, the make-up of the Commission, one Commissioner per Member State as far as we are concerned, the weighting of votes, which should be proportionate to the size of population and qualified majority voting."
"This should encompass the budget but also agriculture and legislation."
"Secondly, there is the integration of the second and third pillars, more integration in the Treaties."
"In order to achieve this, more of a Community approach needs to be adopted."
"Thirdly, the new Treaty should contain a sound legal basis for a European regulation on the openness of government and transparency."
"Fourthly, we also need a legal basis for the European Union itself so that we can act autonomously in bodies such as the United Nations and the WTO."
"And I agree with those who say that the constitutional aspects in the Treaty should be separated from those components relating to the executive."
"I think this is a sound line to take."
"Finally, this Charter of Fundamental Rights, to be laid down in future, should be embedded in the new Treaty."
"These seem to me to be the salient points."
"As for the procedure, our most important wish is, of course, maximum involvement of Parliament."
"Two MEPs seems just fine but they will need to be able to play a full part."
"We give our full backing to the reports of Mr Leinen and Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"They did a marvellous job and let us hope that the summit in Helsinki will indeed decide to incorporate the wider agenda we are proposing in the IGC"
"Mr President, in our debate on the mandate for the forthcoming IGC, I would firstly like to say a few words on an issue which is not on this Conference' s agenda but that, I think, our Chamber will have to consider, when the day comes, in order to study and evaluate the results of the whole exercise."
"This is the issue of the reform of the Council, of the whole package of reforms which, we have been told, must and can take place in addition to a reform of the Treaties."
"Fine."
"Let us set out on this path, but let us do so with a reasonable timetable that is the same timetable that the IGC has."
"My group has tabled an amendment to this effect and I hope that, tomorrow, our Chamber will be able to vote for it."
"With regard to the three ""left-over"" questions, do we think today that we are in a position to answer the question to which the Amsterdam Summit could not find a solution?"
"What is this question?"
"We must have the courage to ask it."
"It is perhaps less a question of how to function than of what it is that we want to do together when there are sixteen or twenty-seven of us."
"If we do not answer this question, we will not find a solution to the three questions ""left over"" from Amsterdam."
"At any event, preparing the Union for the forthcoming enlargement opens up a question outstanding from Amsterdam, and that is the question of strengthened cooperation."
"Because, apart from the three institutional questions, which are already part of the IGC' s mandate, nobody in the context of the Amsterdam assessment has been able to tell us if the solutions that we had arrived at concerning the operation of this strengthened cooperation were satisfactory."
"We must work towards a reform of this strengthened cooperation which will allow the Union to establish a real vanguard, open within the Union, in order to continue to make progress towards the security, democracy and stability of our continent."
"Mr President, you will not believe this, but exactly 200 years ago, namely in 1799, there was the first discussion of a constitution, not for Europe but for Bavaria."
"This was partly for the purpose of establishing responsibilities but also because of the radical shifts in territory due to an almost 83 per cent increase in the area of Bavaria."
"The person with the big idea of having a constitution was the then Bavarian prime minister, Graf Montgelas, who did himself great credit by establishing a French administration in Bavaria."
"However, he was at the same time also the fiercest opponent of a parliament, because this could supposedly introduce unpredictable factors into politics."
"The arguments for and against went on for a further 18 years until at last the constitution was established and its opponents were finally quashed."
"And there were then already democratic elements in this constitution."
"Now, something else that is astonishing: the basis of the constitution was, at that time, a preamble which was drafted in 1799 and which was to set out the fundamental rights, and all this 200 years ago!"
"I think the parallels between then and now are quite amazing."
"History shows that the doubters' arguments, both then and now, are almost the same."
"Let us learn from history not to allow further decades to go by before Europe has a constitution."
"This is something for the future that we must prepare for."
"I should therefore like to encourage the Council not only to respect Parliament' s proposals but also to make them its own."
"We need a Europe which is able to act and which can also take necessary decisions."
"For we must also take democracy seriously, and the responsibilities which the national parliaments have given away must pass into the hands of the European Parliament, that is to say become part of the process of codecision making."
"We need codecision making by the European Parliament, for the European Parliament is the biggest factor favouring the integration of Europe."
"Mr President, we already know about some of the issues that will be discussed at the forthcoming WTO negotiations: they are the so-called ""left-overs"" from Amsterdam."
"However, at the moment, we are not fully aware of what issues will feature at the start of the forthcoming IGC and these are issues that must be discussed, particularly with a view to achieving efficiency and with a view to an enlargement that it is thought will happen and which is greatly desired."
"I would like to say here that reforming a Treaty with a view to achieving efficiency strikes me as a very unambitious exercise for the European project, and I fear that this exercise may be nothing but a power game which will allow a small group of countries to set themselves up as a board of directors and to lead and direct the European project."
"A Europe led by a board of directors would be a negation of the stimulating process of European integration that we have had - it is true that it has its imperfections, but all countries have taken part in it - and, in our opinion, strengthened cooperation must be the exception and not the rule in the European Union. This is because often, the political will to cooperate exists, but the conditions are not right from the economic point of view or from some other point of view, in order to achieve this very will for strengthened cooperation."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me give you an example of this: if there were a change to the weighting of votes within the Council, which would mean that the countries with a higher population as well as the larger countries would in fact have more power, and if the extension of qualified majority voting, extended to the codecision procedure, meant that this tendency in the European Parliament also became more marked, my question is: what role will the European Union' s small or weak countries have in Europe?"
"I prefer cohesion to efficiency, and as Commissioner Barnier raised the issue a while ago of there being 27 of us in Europe, I would like to say, Commissioner, that I think that in the decisions of this Europe of 27, it is more important that all countries feel involved in the decision-making process, than discussing whether, when there are 27 of us, it will take us one hour, less than two hours or three hours to take decisions."
"Cohesion is more important than efficiency if we are in fact to have a European Union with as cohesive and generous an enterprise as the one that we have seen and in which we have participated."
"Mr President, the Ancient Roman jurisconsultants used to say that ex facto oritur jus (the law is formed from events)."
"I think that credit must be given to Messrs Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen for laying the first foundations of a new foedus (treaty), a kind of pact on European unity which is organised around differences and which attempts mediation and, in particular, to find basic principles and unities."
"Europe still has a lot of work to do in order to build a democratic future."
"However, some points have now been identified: a foreign and security policy needs to be a truly common one."
"Indeed, I think that, in addition to banks, the economy and social and structural policies, the common foreign and security policy will be another driving factor towards true integration."
"We need a European Parliament that is the general legislating body of the Union - like the Council - that participates fully in appointing members of the other institutions and is able to establish a relationship of trust with the European Commission, which is no longer weakened by the double qualified majority now necessary for a motion of censure."
"We need a Council of Ministers that decides by a majority."
"I think that other issues, such as the greater integration of the national parliaments in the Community' s decision-making process, are useless elements that just complicate matters."
"Local regions and communities should also participate with more dignity at the stages of creation and implementation of Community law."
"The part provided for by the provisions on the Structural Funds could become the basic principle for the new European construction."
"The European Parliament must play a truly constituent part, and continue the spirit of Alcide De Gasperi, Schuman, Adenauer and Kohl to stay in the tradition of a people' s Europe - but it has had important supporters in other political families as well, such as Altiero Spinelli, François Mitterrand and Henry Spaak."
"We are approaching a time that will be decisive for Europe' s survival as an entity and as a model."
"The attacks are no longer military, but economic and political, and the adversaries are no longer those of the Cold War."
"If we want to equip ourselves in order to overcome the challenge of the new millennium, then we will have to equip ourselves with the necessary legal and institutional instruments, in the belief that Europe will remain Europe only if it is prepared to carry out self-examination and accept this giant leap towards the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this forthcoming summit can undoubtedly be a success if the factors stemming from Parliament' s debates and which are written down in this report are in fact taken account of."
"I should like here to seize quite specifically upon one particular point."
"I was particularly pleased to see that the report has dealt not only with the reform of the treaties and of procedures, and therefore was not just worded in general terms, but has in the last analysis declared itself in favour of setting and specifying priorities to the effect, for example, that progress must be achieved in the interests of the security of Europe and its citizens in connection with the further development of the area of freedom, security and justice, and that relevant procedures must be established so that this becomes a reality."
"In that way, citizens will be given a signal and main focus."
"In the report, a goal is also formulated which I consider to be particularly important, namely that Europe must be seen by its citizens to be transparent and to be conducting a more open debate."
"This, too, I consider to be absolutely necessary, as well as being a good opportunity, especially in connection with the development of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We can show here that, in circumstances where the Member States are at their wits' end, Europe can, in the last analysis, be helpful to the individual."
"If it is a fact of life that organised crime earns billions which, by being introduced into the legal economic cycle, damages our legitimate systems, indeed society as a whole, then we need Europol and we need European cooperation in the field of justice."
"If the drug trade already constitutes 8% of the volume of trade worldwide, then we must develop Europol as a European institution."
"If 400,000 asylum seekers are already coming to Europe each year, then we need relevant European regulations."
"By that, I mean that this report addresses something very real and contains elements which signify a genuine opportunity for the Helsinki Summit."
"We shall see whether, at this summit, Europe' s representatives can in actual fact avail themselves, in the interests of our citizens, of this chance to create more transparency and more opportunities for the individual."
"We can only hope so."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, explained very effectively, there are many of us who think that the Intergovernmental Conference should begin a genuine constitutionalisation process for the European Union."
"In that way we would surely be in a position to deal with the circumstances, with the real demands and we would be able to respond to the challenge of restoring the citizens' interest in the European construction process, an interest which was statistically proven to be low after the poor turnout at the elections of 13 June."
"To accompany the undeniable success of Monetary Union, we must also make progress with Political Union and in fields which broaden the competences of the European Union in order to prevent the current imbalances; I would describe these imbalances as enormous."
"There is no doubt that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference must go much further than the fine words of Amsterdam, even though they are very important."
"I talked before of constitutionalisation and, personally, I believe in a federal perspective."
"The Treaties should also include that Charter of Fundamental Rights which is to be drawn up in the coming months; lay down majority decision making - as a general rule - and, logically, and simultaneously, the codecision procedure."
"It should also increase the powers of the European Parliament, for example granting it the power to ratify all the international treaties, whatever their type or nature may be, and, of course, ensure that the coming reforms are carried out according to a method which is much more open, transparent, democratic and participatory than the current one."
"However, when we talk about methods and institutions, we must not forget politics."
"For example, we must integrate the functions of the Western European Union into the Union in order to prevent new Kosovos, but we must also promote the coordination of economic policies, fiscal harmonisation and the creation of employment and a genuine social Europe which will allow us to confront the concerns of the citizens."
"The current method is rather worn out but, in any case, it is essential that the Council commits itself to taking appropriate account of the proposals which the Commission and the Parliament make in turn."
"Mr President, the main themes are now generally known, and it is not only since the Dehaene report that everyone has been talking about them."
"But, in addition to these main objectives, without whose attainment an enlargement of the European Union would scarcely be conceivable, a number of basic questions, relating naturally to policy on fisheries, ought not to be forgotten."
"With the Amsterdam Treaty, no satisfactory solution was found for the fisheries sector."
"Firstly, I demand - as I also did in 1996 - that fisheries be mentioned specifically in the Treaties."
"Fisheries must no longer be regarded as a mere appendage of agriculture."
"The importance of fisheries as one of the few existing sectors for which there are Community policies must at last be emphasised by fisheries' being given their own chapter. This chapter must state the goals of the common fisheries policy, its principles and, above all, the legal procedures governing its regulation."
"Secondly, Parliament must be more thoroughly involved than it has been so far in defining the most important themes in the fisheries sphere."
"I demand genuine decision-making powers in connection with the basic aspects of the common fisheries policy and the regulations governing, for example, market organisation, the preservation and management of stocks, supervisory regulations and the tools of structural policy; in other words, nothing less than codecision making by Parliament."
"Thirdly, it is also necessary in the field of international politics to strengthen the role of Parliament and to introduce the procedure for agreeing to the conclusion of all international fisheries agreements."
"My final point is that Parliament' s participation is also to be desired at meetings of bodies forming part of international organisations."
"The points mentioned, which take account of the importance of fisheries in Europe, must therefore be picked out as central themes at the next Intergovernmental Conference when the role of Parliament is being considered."
"Happily, I have just heard from Giorgos that a compromise Amendment is being submitted which also refers to the subject of fisheries."
"Thank you for that."
"I trust that the House will support this."
"Mr President, thanks are due to the two rapporteurs."
"Finland' s Portugal' s and France' s Presidencies of the Council are to be requested to comply with the proposals in this report which is quite rightly based upon the criticism, partly by this European Parliament, of the decisions in Amsterdam."
"For no other reason than that Mr Tsatsos has again referred to the matter, I should like to emphasise that the proposal in subparagraph 5 is really of central importance."
"It is important that we obtain a package proposal for global reform in which the important questions relating to majority voting are dealt with just as much as those relating to reform of the institutions and other important themes."
"I think that the most important thing here is that we consider how the European Union might be provided with a constitution."
"This demand can hardly be emphasised enough, for Europe can only come of age when it provides itself with a constitution."
"The purposes and goals of the European Union are too unclear at the moment."
"The European Parliament has quite rightly already submitted several draft constitutions, and I think that these ought to make it clear that Europe is more than a market."
"We must therefore be thinking in terms of a Brussels Republic, a unique community of States without historical precedent."
"Whether the discussion of a European constitution will imbue Europe' s citizens with more enthusiasm for Europe is unclear."
"On account of the problems entailed in legitimising an area or a market without the structure of a State, the attempt does need, however, to be made to inspire such enthusiasm. This must also go hand in hand with the development of a European civil society and of a European public."
"We are seeing a change worldwide in the essential character of national sovereignty because States do not have unlimited freedom of action, either at home or abroad, and their ability to form policies and solve problems is limited by the realities of international relations and of trans-national forms of interdependence and interaction."
"This is particularly apparent in connection with the economy, trade and competition."
"It is precisely in this area, too, that it is very important to move from the principle of unanimity to majority voting."
"The European Union must become better able to act and it therefore needs a new separation of powers through a catalogue of competences."
"In view of the changed circumstances, a new system for the separation of powers must be devised which augments the classical separation of powers as prescribed by Montesquieu with a new form of separation of powers at different levels."
"We need integrated multi-level decision-making processes."
"The coordination processes at present prescribed are inadequate to the task of organising European added value."
"That is particularly clear from the difficulties between economic union and monetary union and the difficulties between the political union and the economic and monetary union."
"Since we cannot boost democracy, through interinstitutional agreements in this area, we also, in fact, require a revision of the Treaty in this regard."
"Mr President, the Dehaene report contains a proposal of historic importance, namely the division of the Treaties into two parts: a part concerned with fundamental rights and the institutions which, as hitherto, can only be changed through the unanimous decision of the Intergovernmental Conference and through a procedure of ratification by the Member States; and a special part for specific policy areas which, instead of ratification, would require the agreement of the European Parliament."
"In view of the fact that the Commission - and I am very grateful to Mr Barnier for this - has accepted in its proposals a division of this kind for the Amendment procedures too, it would appear faint-hearted if now Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs were to accept the two-fold division but not the distinction between the procedures."
"It is also necessary to introduce different procedures because, following enlargement, the European Union would otherwise lose its ability to act."
"To that extent, I would thank rapporteur Leinen for his remark on this subject, but I cannot unfortunately find it in his report."
"I am in favour of introducing such a two-fold division of procedures, but only under a specific condition."
"It must be guaranteed that the abolition of the ratification procedure for specified areas of policy would not entail any weakening of the rights of the Member States and that the European Union would not acquire for itself a right to extend its powers at the expense of the constituent Member States."
"This can be guaranteed by means of a motion submitted by a number of colleagues and myself in which we conclude and demand that a catalogue of competences be incorporated into the basic part of the Treaty, clearly defining the competences of the European Union, clearly limiting those competences as well as encouraging application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Only in this way can the European Union, without at the same time eroding the rights of the Member States, become more able to act and efficiently limit its work to specified policy areas."
"I would therefore particularly ask the rapporteurs - partly in order to ensure that their report obtains a broad majority in the House - to examine these two motions sympathetically."
"Mr President, this debate has shown that a lot more would be necessary than we have incorporated into our report."
"Budget policy, trade policy, tax policy and competition policy have been mentioned."
"Everywhere, in fact, there is a need for reform; to that extent, Parliament was very focused."
"I nonetheless think that we ought to be as ambitious as the Commission and carry out a further two improvements tomorrow."
"The latter I am happy to take up - a duly facilitated revision of the second part of the newly divided Treaties and also a clause concerning strengthened cooperation in a Europe with 27 or 30 States."
"I also hope that this will obtain a majority in the House tomorrow."
"Lastly, I should like to thank the Commission whose demands are almost identical with those of Parliament."
"Now, it is a question of conducting a public debate with the governments but also with the populations of Europe so that we might also implement the results at the Intergovernmental Conference in the year 2000."
"I would like to thank everybody who has contributed to this task."
"Mr President, Mr Leinen, you now have the misfortune of having to speak between Mr von Boetticher and myself."
"I would therefore take the liberty of again reminding you of one aspect of what Mr von Boetticher quite correctly pointed out here, namely that it is also a part of this package that a clear framework of competences of the European Union is to be laid down in the general, basic part of the Treaties."
"Perhaps the same is true of yourself as it is of me: through the opening of accession negotiations with a further twelve potential Member States, the scales have, as it were, fallen from our eyes and we have seen what immense consequences and effects the enlargement is going to have on the European Union itself."
"Basically, this is not a traditional accession of States."
"With the union of twelve new and fifteen old Member States, we are, rather, facing the situation of a re-establishment of the Union."
"The necessity of comprehensive reforms has therefore been emphasised quite rightly here."
"I should just like to issue one warning."
"We ought not now to be tempted to repeat the old demands which we have always made, but now under the banner of the enlargement of the Union, for that would basically prevent us from seeing that we must consider completely new visions of our European Union."
"I should like briefly in this regard to consider one idea."
"I am convinced that, with 27 Member States, it will be impossible for the European Union to be as active in the same breadth and depth as it is with the present fifteen Member States."
"We must therefore also concentrate on the key competences of the European Union and, in this connection, consider in which areas it is indispensable for the European Union to be active."
"I am certain that, with some good will, we can find a whole range of other areas where that is not the case."
"I want to add one last remark."
"I should not like here to associate myself with the general European chiding directed against centralism, but I should like to canvass for a comprehensive, honest critique of the European Union' s tasks so that we do not need to be afraid that our achievements will be jeopardised through enlargement."
"Mr President, on closing this debate, this important debate, with an important and excellent report, what could be better than to talk of justice."
"Until now, justice has been rather absent from the general debate."
"I believe that all political communities are judged by the justice they provide."
"The reality is that our justice system is not sufficient for the competences which have been transferred to the European institutions, the Community competences, especially the competences which have to be reviewed from a legal point of view."
"Therefore I believe - and this should include the strict current mandate for the Conference with regard to the revision of the institutions in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam - that we have to deal with the necessary and thorough reform of our Court of Justice and our Court of First Instance and the reform of the appointment of judges - in which the Parliament should have a significant involvement - as well as the reform of the distribution of competences between the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, so that citizens may have an accurate and clear idea of what this European justice, which is their direct form of justice, really is, and the reform, finally - and this is another chapter - of the actionability of the acts."
"I will end by saying, Mr President, that all of this will become all the more necessary in view of the other great mandate, the launch of which will be the finishing touch of the Finnish Presidency - the excellent Finnish Presidency, whose many successes it is a great honour to recognise in this Chamber and which has been a turning point in the behaviour of the Council."
"There is a ""before and after"" of the Finnish Presidency with regard to the daily treatment of this Parliament."
"That other challenge is to launch the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"There is also a problem here between the Court of Luxembourg and the Court of Strasbourg."
"Mr President, as I said at the beginning, a political community is judged by the justice it provides."
"Let us be aware of this and let us deal with this reform."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"Mr President, I am delighted to make this point of order in the presence of the Commission and the Council, because the issue in question is particularly serious."
"At 5 p.m. today, a text signed by Mr Barón Crespo and some of his accomplices requested that the debate on the Napolitano report that was due to take place at 7 p.m. should be postponed until tomorrow."
"It was asked, in the form of a topical and urgent motion, that a debate tabled for 8 p.m. this evening should be postponed until tomorrow morning."
"Kindly explain to us the reason for this urgency."
"Furthermore, this request was formulated according to Rule 112 of our Rules of Procedure which refers back to article 60 whereas Mr Napolitano' s report, as it is quite clearly stated in the legal grounds of the aforementioned report, is a report which is covered by article 181, since it concerns the internal Rules of Procedure of our Parliament."
"It is therefore not a legislative proposal or an assimilated text at all, as the justification made by Mr Barón Crespo claims."
"Mr Barón Crespo has accustomed Parliament to his Stalinist methods, to this Soviet way of treating Parliament for fifteen years."
"What we want, apart from any fundamental issue that we will address tomorrow, is to try to enlighten MEPs about a mistake that has been made, so that we do not continue to make this mistake."
"We are driving ourselves into a dead end by flouting MEPs' prerogatives, by flouting the European Union' s history of parliamentarianism and that of all its Member States. And because we do not want to rectify mistakes that we made six months ago, we are prepared to institutionalise informing within our Parliament, which allows any assistant or official in Parliament to inform on someone because he suspects that so and so' s brother-in-law' s cousin may have committed fraud!"
"It is absolutely scandalous!"
"I request that this decision by Parliament be revoked."
"It is unacceptable."
"I request, in accordance with article 115, that the debate be included in the agenda 24 hours after the different versions have been made available to MEPs, that is, not before mid-day tomorrow."
"I think that before Mr Dupuis gets so excited and starts making such exaggerated accusations he should first verify what has actually happened."
"The fact is that the Napolitano report was not available in all the languages 24 hours before the debates and before the vote, as required by Rule 115."
"In order, therefore, to safeguard the Rules of this House and the Rules governing every Member, to ensure that Members have the rights they enjoy under these Rules, the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, with the support, as was announced earlier, of the EPP Group, requested that to make sure we were in conformity with our Rules, Rule 112 on urgent procedure should be applied."
"This will be put to the House tomorrow morning to vote on."
"It will be a sovereign decision of this House to decide whether we can apply urgent procedure to this report."
"There is nothing undemocratic about that."
"It respects the Rules of Procedure and it respects what the majority in this House wants."
"A question I think one could ask is about the motives of those who have tried to filibuster this report from beginning to end, of those who have tried to block it, of those who have tried every trick in the book and everything in the rule book to try and have it postponed."
"I wonder what it is that makes them fear OLAF having the right to verify that Members are conducting their affairs properly in this House."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to say that Mr Corbett' s intervention may have been a politically-motivated speech, but it did not refer to the Rules of Procedure either, except to answer Mr Dupuis."
"I would like to say..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Dell' Alba, you are not tabling a procedural motion."
"Rule 112 must be applied in accordance with the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 112 refers to Rule 60."
"Mr Corbett knows the Rules of Procedure too well not to know that this rule does not apply to modifications to the Rules of Procedure concerning the Treaties or the interinstitutional agreements."
"I therefore support Mr Dupuis' request."
"I suggest that we return tomorrow morning having considered Mr Dupuis' arguments and my own with the aim of deeming the request formulated by the three groups unacceptable."
"Mistakes can happen."
"By the way, the matter is obviously unacceptable because they are not basing their arguments on the Rules of Procedure but on a rather inappropriate interpretation of the rules governing Parliament."
"The Presidency notes these procedural motions and the Bureau will decide accordingly."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next point on the agenda is Council question time (B5-0033/1999)."
"Question No 1 by (H-0548/99):"
"Subject: Rail route across the Pyrenees The route crossing the Pyrenees via the Aspe Valley and the Somport Pass has for several years been a subject of controversy within local communities and the public at large and the national authorities affected by the choice of mode."
"The road link is being modernised and expanded even though there is still an old partly disused railway line linking France and Spain."
"On account of various protests and environmental considerations, the road-works were halted, and the national authorities and the Commission began discussions and to reconsider the strategies in terms of modes, the idea being to treat the rail link as a future key trans-European network."
"That notwithstanding, the road-works resumed in the valley on 13 September."
"The Union, however, is already financing a feasibility study on the rail route, and the programme of the Presidency-in-Office states that revitalisation of European railways must be treated as a priority."
"Can the Presidency say why the road-works have resumed?"
"Has the Union entered into other financial commitments regarding the Aspe Valley route across the Pyrenees, apart from the above-mentioned study?"
"Will not the Presidency take steps with a view to coordinating the positions of the French and Spanish governments so as to permanently rule out any road development project, since that option would remove the future need for the rail route, especially where freight carriage was concerned?"
"Mr President, I would like to say to the honourable member that the Council does not have the information you are asking for."
"Regarding this matter, I should point out that monitoring the trans-European transport network is within the competence of the Commission."
"Under Article 18 of the decision taken by the European Parliament and the Council on the Trans-European Network, the Member States regularly provide the Commission with national plans and programmes drawn up to develop the Trans-European Network, particularly regarding projects concerning the common interest, as identified in this decision."
"Mr President, thank you for your answer, but I do not find it very satisfactory because the Somport issue is ancient history."
"I am therefore astonished that the Council is not up to date on this, given that several questions have already been asked on this subject."
"I am equally astonished that you can speak of the trans-European Network whereas the Members concerned, France and Spain, do not consider this stretch of road to be part of the trans-European Network at all."
"If it were the case, I would immediately request that a study of the impact of this matter be made."
"I asked you this question because works have started again in Aspe valley."
"These are huge works just to make a small bypass around the small village of Bedous."
"They are having a considerable impact on the environment and we know very well that in the long run in France, the usual piecemeal approach will be adopted, like slicing a salami, and that tiny slice by tiny slice, we will end up with a motorway or a dual carriageway in the Aspe valley."
"Today, then, I would like to see the Council ask what France' s real commitments are in this matter and what means for crossing the Pyrenees the authorities really want to put in place, and I am directing these words to the Finnish Presidency, which has committed itself to the rail crossing and which has spoken in favour of it."
"If you do not mind, I suggest that you launch an initiative to promote alternative means of transport to the road transport in ecologically sensitive areas, otherwise we will continue to ask you this kind of question and we will only be able to say..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to repeat that this matter falls more within the competence of the Commission, and the Commission' s last question time was here in Parliament yesterday."
"As the following question referred to a rail connection between France and Spain in the Pyrenees, I would, however, like to say that this rail connection is not at present part of the Trans-European Network, as approved by the European Parliament and the Council in 1996."
"For that reason, financing may not come from the budget heading relating to the Trans-European Network."
"This issue is of great interest to me, but since I am acting as President for the sitting, I am not going to allow a supplementary question."
"Question No 2 by (H-0550/99):"
"Subject: Council's plans for combating drug abuse in the context of an area of freedom, security and justice During the Finnish Presidency, particular priority has been given to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Within that area, the fight against drugs is especially important in view of the scale of drug trafficking and the drastic social consequences of drug abuse for individuals and society."
"Will the Council say what measures it envisages to combat drug abuse in giving priority to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice?"
"On the basis of the European Union' s strategy for the period 1995-1999, the European Council urged the institutions, in Vienna in December 1998, to further develop an integrated and well-balanced anti-drugs strategy for the period after 1999, taking account of the new opportunities provided by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Commission subsequently submitted to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, its communication concerning the European Union' s action plan for combating drugs during the period 2000-2004."
"On the basis of the guidelines from the European Council, the work carried out by the previous country to hold the Presidency, the communication from the Commission and the contributions which the Member States and different working parties within the Commission have made to the Commission's communication, we have drafted a proposal for the EU's drugs strategy for the period 2000-2004."
"In so doing, we have taken account of the views of both the European Parliament and of the above-mentioned institutions and bodies."
"This new anti-drugs strategy is needed now because the existing EU strategy will have run its course by the end of this year."
"Through the Amsterdam Treaty, a great many new opportunities have arisen which must be examined and utilised, both in the area of protecting people' s health and in the areas of legal cooperation and of cooperation with the police and customs."
"The purpose of this new strategy is to confirm that the EU' s fight against drugs in the future will be broad in scope."
"The new strategy includes measures to reduce supply and demand, together with measures at an international level."
"At the special meeting of the European Council in Tampere in October, on the subject of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, the emphasis was partly upon the importance of an overarching approach to tackling the drugs problem."
"New guidelines were also provided for future work in the fight against drugs."
"The European Council encouraged the Council to adopt the EU' s anti-drugs strategy for the years 2000-2004 before the European Council in Helsinki."
"The European Council in Tampere urged that, in accordance with the Treaty, joint research groups be established without delay as a first step in the fight against the drugs trade, trade in human beings and terrorism."
"It was also considered that, with regard to national criminal law, efforts to come to agreements regarding joint definitions, sanctions and bases for prosecutions should, at the initial stage, focus upon a limited number of sectors of special significance, such as the illegal trade in drugs."
"The decision made in Tampere concerning extended powers for Europol, together with intensified measures against money laundering, will contribute to the European Union' s fight against drugs."
"I should like to begin by thanking the Council for its answer."
"I asked this question quite a long time ago, in fact before the Tampere Summit."
"I think that the questions concerning drugs were dealt with at the Tampere Summit in a useful, more integrated way and with a view to developing a future strategy, especially in regard to combating the drugs trade and adjacent areas such as money laundering."
"I am satisfied with the answer and can only hope that the process we have now set in motion through the Tampere Summit will continue and result in concrete measures so that we might together be able to tackle criminal behaviour of this kind and the major problem constituted by the drugs trade."
"There has not really been a question, but if Mr Sasi wishes to respond, he may do so."
"Allow me to say just briefly that, as the Tampere Summit shows, the fight against the drugs trade is one of the priority areas of the European Union' s policy."
"There is an extremely long list of objectives and fundamental features for the next plan of operations, covering the years 2000-2004."
"I believe that, with these guidelines, very effective measures in this field of work can be produced fairly soon."
"Europol, which you mentioned, is only an information collection and exchange centre."
"Do you think that it should be given operational powers to follow drug traffickers moving across Europe?"
"This is a matter which is still being looked into. However, it is at the same time a fact that cooperation between the police authorities and also between police, customs and legal authorities must be increased."
"Clearly, the first step must be an exchange of information between the police authorities and via Europol."
"I believe however that, in the future, we are going to see a development of the kind which the Member predicts in his question."
"Question No 3 by (H-0557/99):"
"Subject: Appropriateness of financing UNDCP programmes The UNDCP has published the results of an annual survey of opium production, which show that estimated total raw opium production in Afghanistan has more than doubled in a year, rising from 2,100 tonnes in 1998 to 4,600 tonnes in 1999."
"The area devoted to opium cultivation has increased by 43%, from 64,000 to 91,000 hectares."
"97% of opium production in 1999 is in areas under Taleban control and the number of Afghan districts where it is grown has risen from 73 to 104."
"Global opium production has increased from 3,750 tonnes to 6,000 tonnes B an increase of 60%."
"For some years the UNDCP has been engaged in costly intensive programmes to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which are directly managed by the Taleban, who are known for the violent and segregationist system they have forced on the country."
"The EU budget provides funding for the UNDCP and its programmes, including the one involving Afghanistan."
"Does the Council not consider that the EU should suspend its support, including financial support, for the >Taleban project= and carry out a thorough investigation into the effectiveness and management of the funds by the UNDCP?"
"Does the Council not consider that the use of EU funds by the UNDCP for programmes carried out by regimes which do not respect even minimum human rights constitutes a serious infringement of the principle of conditionality which inspires EU action?"
"Mr President, the European Union is very concerned about drugs production in Afghanistan. Its direct and indirect effect extends geographically far and wide."
"The country to hold the Presidency has decided that close monitoring of the situation in Iran and Afghanistan will be the focus point of the action it takes on drugs."
"The negative effects on civil society, for example in Europe and Russia, Central Asia and Iran, cannot be underestimated."
"The European Union finds it alarming that the majority of heroin used in the Member States comes from the poppy fields of Afghanistan."
"The Union has noted the recent report by the UN drugs control programme, the UNDCP, according to which Afghanistan is, at present, clearly the largest global producer of opium."
"Its world share of production is 75%."
"In 1999 opium production grew by 100% on the previous year, reaching the highest volume so far, with a figure of 4,600 tons, which is partly due to the considerable expansion of the crop-growing sector."
"The Council proposed an overall EU policy in an amended EU common position on Afghanistan, which was adopted on 25 January 1999."
"The main aims for Afghanistan are inter alia to achieve a lasting peace and promote an internal dialogue for Afghanistan by offering specific support for the key role played by the UN; in addition, to promote stability and development for the whole region through peace in the country, and to make the prevention of illegal drugs production and terrorism more effective."
"Owing to the politically unstable situation in the country and the civil war, not one Member State recognises the Taleban government."
"A common position by the Union, however, urges Member States to maintain relations with all Afghan groups."
"The European Union has condemned the many violations of human rights that have occurred in Afghanistan, especially the continual and systematic discrimination towards women and girl children, executions carried out without trial and a system based on harsh discipline and tyranny."
"Because the political situation in Afghanistan is critical, and conditions are not right for the creation of bilateral relations, it is difficult, in the opinion of the European Union, to participate effectively in drugs control activity in Afghanistan."
"The European Union has noted that the UN drugs control programme, the UNDCP, began its pilot programme in Afghanistan, one that made slow but steady progress, in 1998."
"The programme is based on the UNDCP' s commitment to financing development in special poppy field areas, to which the Taleban have responded by agreeing not to allow the cultivation of opium poppies in new areas, and to permit the UNDCP to control the opium poppy crop and commence action to prevent the illegal traffic of drugs and pull down illegal laboratories."
"Mr President, I can well believe that the Council is concerned by what has happened."
"My question, however, was different and was about past results."
"Past results tell us that production has doubled."
"With the commitment of the common position of January 1998, the Council said that the Union would support all the efforts of the UNDCP in Afghanistan, and you have done this with your financing."
"The problem is the result of that financing."
"The result is that production has doubled."
"My question is therefore whether you are going to continue along this same ruinous path, that does not only affect Afghanistan: in fact, the problem is that the European Union is continuing to finance the UNDCP even on programmes such as the consolidation of penal codes in countries such as China and Burma, countries where simple drug addicts are condemned to die, and indirectly, we, through the UNDCP, are collaborating and financing this type of project."
"Therefore, faced with a specific failure which is documented in these policies, the question is: are we going to continue to finance this type of project even though it actually makes totalitarian regimes stronger, regimes that are in fact criminal and oppress human rights?"
"That is my question."
"Mr President, I will be happy to answer the honourable member' s new question, which concerns UNDCP funding."
"The UNDCP is not financed out of the European Union budget."
"The European Union supports the work of the UNDCP on a general level, which it does in a well established and effective way in the area of drugs control, and it is also very satisfied with the cooperation that has taken place with the UNDCP in other areas."
"As the honourable member stated, operations in Afghanistan are hampered by the lack of any broadly based government and, thus, a suitable and reliable partner in cooperation."
"The European Union is working with Afghanistan' s neighbours, mainly in Central Asia as well as Iran, to enhance anti-drugs cooperation conducted with them."
"The Union considers Central Asia to be strategically important in the control of drugs and is at present drafting an action plan for the region."
"One cause of the critical drug situation is the lack of any proper border control between Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Khirgizia, Uzbekistan and Russia."
"The European Union is attempting to resolve the problem by promoting the TACIS projects implemented within the context of customs cooperation and of justice and home affairs."
"The projects aim, among other things, to make border controls more efficient between Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, improve the training of customs officials, and increase drugs-related expertise in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Khirgizia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Russia."
"Regarding Iran, the European Union has been informed that the UNDCP has just approved a drugs control programme for that country, and opened an office there."
"Member States are at present exploring ways in which they can participate in financing this programme."
"Question No 4 by (H-0609/99):"
"Subject: Joint drugs action centre International action is required to combat the problems posed by drugs."
"European, national and local efforts alone are not sufficient for dealing with global problems."
"The public in the EU has a direct interest in preventing the spread of drugs."
"Efforts to curb the influx of drugs are being made by EU Member States and by the USA."
"More organised forms of cooperation could help to make such efforts more effective."
"What is the Council's position on forming a partnership with the USA in order to set up a joint drugs action centre in Bangkok?"
"Have steps been taken to enhance the prospects of such an alternative approach?"
"I apologise for my inaccurate pronunciation of your surname but at last we know who you are!"
"In the joint action plan for the EU and the United States, signed in Madrid on 3 December 1995, the following are prescribed under the heading ""Reaction to Global Challenges"" : increased cooperation in the fight against illegal drug trading, measures of cooperation between competent American authorities and Europol, cooperation in supporting the UN' s drugs monitoring programme, coordination of alternative development programmes designed to counteract drug manufacture, and the setting up of channels of cooperation between appropriate bodies, for example the EU' s European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the Inter-American Monitoring Commission for Drug Addiction."
"For the purpose of implementing this action plan, an agreement between the EC and the United States concerning the monitoring of chemical precursors was signed in The Hague on 28 May 1997."
"Further opportunities for strengthening cooperation are being investigated within the EU-USA project group."
"American authorities have approached the European Union with a view to possible cooperation within the international police college in Bangkok, which is a body like the one in Budapest."
"The proposal is currently being dealt with by the Council' s departments."
"I have only praise to give."
"I think this is very good indeed and I want to thank you very much for your answer."
"My only problem is that these questions do not get out to the public."
"Just as the discussion earlier today showed, providing information is a part of the development process for creating understanding for the fact that a variety of measures are required."
"We must try, I believe, both in the Council and the European Parliament, as well as in other EU bodies such as Information Offices, to make the importance of providing information more widely understood."
"Our citizens would then have a better understanding of the need for increased legal and policing measures which are necessary on an international basis. We are certainly in agreement about that."
"My next question is therefore this: are we going to get any information later on about the results which emerge at this centre in Bangkok?"
"As I said, there is no decision as to whether we are to participate in this partnership in Bangkok."
"This proposal is being discussed by the Council' s departments at this moment."
"As I see it, the discussions should take place in a positive spirit."
"As the Member says, there are clearly quite a few questions being discussed and answered here today during the sitting, but there is relatively little information about these questions for the public."
"Where results are concerned, it is in both the Council' s and the Commission' s interests, as well as those of the EU as a whole, to report on progress in this work because this in itself strengthens measures to achieve better results in the fight against drugs."
"Mr Sasi, in the United States the annual USD 18 billion spent in the fight against drugs is increasingly being called into question."
"Very recently, the Financial Times invited the European public to reassess prohibitionist policies."
"I wonder whether, in the appraisals we have been told the Council is making, a cost/benefit assessment has been included of how much these contributions to the so-called fight against drugs are costing European taxpayers and what practical benefits they are bringing."
"I should just like to say briefly that there is an office in Lisbon which deals with questions like that but, as far as I know, no such investigation has been carried out."
"It is a fact that quite a lot of money is spent on these objectives."
"I must say, however, that the fight against drugs is, for all that, so important that it cannot be said that resources invested in this work are too great."
"Instead, I believe that we must try to work along these lines."
"Where drugs policy in different EU countries is concerned, I believe that each individual Member State ought to decide for itself what its policy is to be because we know that there is a wide variety of viewpoints between different countries."
"As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses."
"Question No 6 by (H-0555/99):"
"Subject: Nuclear power stations in territories bordering on the EU In view of the severe damage caused in the EU by the Chernobyl nuclear accident, what policy does the Council propose to follow as regards providing advice to neighbouring countries and cooperating with them in the development of alternative energy sources?"
"Mr President, the Council is concerned, just as the honourable Member is, about nuclear safety and would like to reconfirm that it follows the situation very closely."
"The Council would like to remind everyone of the conclusions reached on 25 May 1994 in this matter, which concern nuclear safety in the electricity industry in Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states, and in which the Council defines its approach to this question."
"In its conclusions, the Council reconfirmed its commitment to promote nuclear safety in the countries in question, and repeated that it was aware that the improvements spoken of must be implemented by means of reliable short- and long-term energy strategies."
"In the Council' s conclusions regarding nuclear safety in connection with EU enlargement, it was emphasised that the countries in question use reactors that are impossible to modernise at reasonable expense to comply with internationally approved standards of safety, and that strategies for the energy industry should include preparations to decommission these reactors as quickly as possible, in accordance with an agreed timetable for our accession partners, and in compliance with the agreements relating to nuclear safety bookkeeping."
"In addition, the Council has said it is ready to support the development of alternative energy sources with the means the EU and the Member States have at their disposal in order to replace the more unreliable nuclear power plants, at the same time taking account of the situation as a whole as well as each country' s special situation and needs."
"In recent years we have regularly taken into consideration the fact that the European Union' s neighbouring countries, whether they be the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe or the countries in the European Free Trade Association, and those belonging to the European Economic Area, participate in important Community action concerning the development of the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency."
"The countries in question may participate in the ALTENER II programme, which is a programme to promote the use of new sources of energy, and in the SAVE II programme, which concerns energy efficiency."
"We should also point out that this opportunity has been exploited on a large scale in the SAVE II programme, participation in which has been decided by the competent Association Council."
"I am glad that the Council has responded positively to this question, specifically with regard to the countries of the Middle East."
"I live in the Canary Islands, 100 kilometres from Tan Tan, a Moroccan location where the Moroccan Government has now begun a nuclear programme."
"My supplementary question to the Council asks whether it would consider the possibility of contacting the Moroccan Government with a view to preventing this enterprise which is dangerous for Morocco and, of course, for us, who are its closest neighbours."
"Mr President, I would like to say that nuclear power, when used reliably and safely, and when properly supervised, is not dangerous."
"As for the associated countries, among others, the threats their nuclear power plants pose have been carefully examined."
"Any action the Commission has requested or ordered has concerned plants where safety problems have been discovered."
"Unfortunately, I do not know much about the Moroccan nuclear power project, and I cannot judge whether it will present risks or whether it will be implemented without paying sufficient attention to possible risk factors."
"We shall try to ensure that such a project fulfils all the necessary demands of nuclear safety and, that being the case, it would not present any kind of danger to the Canaries region either."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am delighted to hear that you say safe nuclear energy is indeed safe to use, because it is impractical to expect countries that are currently producing 30 and 40% of their energy from nuclear power to replace this with renewable energies on any financial or economic terms or with the burning of fossil fuels without considerable further damage to the environment in these already polluted countries."
"Mr President, it is absolutely clear that we can assess the disadvantages of various forms of energy production."
"Obviously, there is no fully standardised method of gauging them, but it is very clear that the greenhouse phenomenon has nothing to do with nuclear power, which does not produce carbon dioxide emissions and, that being the case, it is totally superior to coal or gas, for example."
"But I would like to point out that when nuclear power is used, it must be used safely in all respects."
"I would also remind everyone that in many EU countries nuclear power is used on a massive scale and, regarding my own country, Finland, I can state that we have two nuclear power stations with Russian-built reactors which, according to statistics, are among the world' s best in terms of efficiency and safety."
"Your answer was interesting."
"I should like to refer to a debate we had yesterday about nuclear safety in Eastern Europe."
"I wonder: do you consider that the Commission has a legal basis for what it has said in its progress reports about, among other things, making it a condition of membership of the European Union that the nuclear power station in Bulgaria and the Slovakian one with the difficult name beginning with a ""B"" , Bohunice, should be shut down?"
"Do you consider that there is a legal basis for this?"
"I am a lawyer, but I must say that, as far as I know, there is no legal basis for being able to demand that any reactor be shut down."
"Where accession to the EU is concerned, it must be pointed out that this is always in the end a political decision."
"Each Member State must approve the accession of new Member States."
"Each country' s parliament must also ratify any such agreement."
"As I see it, there is, however, no special legal reason for requiring applicant countries to take measures such as those described, but political realities may be the basis for making certain demands."
"Clearly, the Commission must take account of problems which may arise if, for example, reactors are used which may present a danger to health."
"Obviously, the European Union cannot tolerate our having forms of energy production which may cause health problems for citizens within the Union' s borders."
"Question No 7 by (H-0559/99):"
"Subject: Creating openness through a regulation In the Spring of 1999, COREPER urged the Commission to submit the proposal required to give practical expression to the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty concerning openness."
"Has the Council also urged the new Commission to do so?"
"Would it not be most expedient to submit a specific proposal for a regulation and not a communication as planned last Spring?"
"Which working party will draw up the proposal in the Council B an ad hoc working party of representatives from the Ministries of Justice, for example, or the existing information unit in the Council which currently deals with inquiries concerning documents?"
"As the honourable Member knows, Article 255, formerly Article 191a, of the Treaty establishing the European Community reads as follows:"
"""1."
"Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, shall have a right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3."
"2."
"General principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of access to documents shall be determined by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"3."
"Each institution referred to above shall elaborate in its own Rules of Procedure specific provisions regarding access to its documents."""
"To date, the Commission has not submitted any official proposal for an Act."
"Nor has the Council under such circumstances yet been able to begin discussing the matter."
"In view of the fact that the general principles and limits relating to the public' s right of access, in accordance with Article 255, to the above-mentioned institutions' documents are to be established with the European Parliament in accordance with the relevant decision-making procedure by no later than 30 April 2001, the Council will begin discussing any proposal for an Act as soon as it has received this."
"No decision has yet been made as to the working party which is to be responsible for examining the Commission' s proposal."
"In his programme document on transparency, the chairman of the working party concerned with making information available presented the idea of an ad hoc group consisting specifically of experts on making documents available to the public."
"As you said in your answer, 30 April 2001 is the last date for approving this."
"It is a long and difficult process."
"As citizens and as Members of the European Parliament, we are extremely concerned that there are no concrete signs of the Commission' s putting forward such a proposal during the Finnish Presidency when we should like to have begun the preparation."
"We know, as I mentioned in the question, that COREPER urged the Commission, which is to say the Interim Commission, to submit a proposal."
"What do we know about the situation?"
"It is up to the Commission to put forward something."
"I think we ought to put some pressure now upon the Commission."
"Quite a long time has passed."
"We know that there has been a discussion document which has been circulated and debated in various quarters."
"I am extremely concerned that we shall not be able to comply with the timetable if we do not now urge the Commission to be more pro-active."
"As has been said, openness is one of the absolute priorities for the Finnish Presidency We have therefore been in close contact with the Commission in connection with this issue."
"As the Member says, COREPER too has urged the Commission to come up with a proposal."
"We last discussed this question today with the Commission' s President and the Commission' s secretary-general."
"The information we had today was to the effect that the Commission unfortunately could not submit its proposal this year but that it will be doing so in January of next year."
"Question No 8 by (H-0564/99):"
"Subject: Access to Council documents by the public How much progress has been made with the register of Council documents which would be accessible to the public on the Internet B which I believe was planned for January 1998?"
"Mr President, on the basis of a Council decision made on 19 March 1998, a Council document register was made available to the public on the Internet on 1 January 1999."
"During the first half of 1999 the web site was visited by more than 35,000 people."
"Within six months it held information relating to 43,000 documents."
"The register is proving a reliable and effective tool, which the public can use to acquire information on Council documents."
"Consequently, the number of requests for documents has considerably increased."
"It is now more than double the figure for 1998."
"The document register has thus been on the Internet at the disposal of the public since the start of this year."
"At present, the Council is looking into ways of improving how the registers work, for example, so that other than confidential documents would be available to the public directly from the Internet."
"Let it be noted that so far the Council is the only institution to have made an open register of its documents available to the public, according to the recommendation of the European Ombudsman."
"I am very disappointed by what the Council has done."
"If you boast about 43,000 documents I wonder if you have actually visited the Internet site?"
"This is a very small mouse that you have managed to produce so far."
"Forty-three thousand sounds like a lot."
"But anybody can produce 43,000 documents."
"It is what they say that matters."
"They are very slow in arriving."
"You cannot find out how votes went in the Council."
"That is still secret."
"You cannot find a compte rendu of what people actually said in the Council."
"That is still secret."
"It is deeply inadequate what you have done."
"In answer to the last question, Mr President, you said that transparency was one of the great priorities of the Finnish Presidency."
"The Finnish nation is famous for its openness but so far we have reached November in your Presidency and this is still a disaster."
"Would you please try and improve the register which is, as I said, a very small mouse."
"There is still a long way to go."
"Mr President, according to my information on the present situation there is a monthly summary of voting results available, allowing the public to see how things have gone in the Councils."
"I would also like to say that the public can presently consult a directory of Council documents on the Internet containing reference information on them."
"I would, however, repeat that the competent bodies of the Council are investigating the possibility of improving public access to its documents, so that all documents other than those classified as confidential will be available on the Internet."
"The country to hold the Presidency in any case endorses this position, and I believe that the Council will do its utmost to make its work as open as possible."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council for confirmation that information on which country voted in which way is not at the moment given when the Council issues its press releases at the end of each Council meeting."
"Would the Finnish Presidency not agree that there are still a number of Council meetings to be held before the end of its Presidency and that it could use them as a very useful precedent for establishing its credentials in terms of openness - which at the moment, I am afraid, do not exist - by making sure at the very least that when press releases are published at the end of Council meetings, those press releases list exactly how each country voted on each issue on which there was a vote?"
"Mr President, it is true that the bulletins issued after Council meetings do not make immediately clear which countries voted which way."
"However, I would like to repeat that information on how the Member States voted is made public in monthly reports."
"I would also like to say that the press normally carry stories, often before the meetings, on how the various states intend to vote on different issues in the Council."
"Question No 9 by (H-0563/99):"
"Subject: Political prisoners in Burma Could the President-in-Office report on any recent debates and decisions taken by the Council of Foreign Ministers on the subject of the EU's policy towards Burma, and in particular on the possibility of securing from the Burmese government an amnesty for political prisoners?"
"Mr President, the Council has expressed in many connections its concern to the Burmese authorities regarding the situation in the country, and most recently at the plenary part-session on 11 and 12 October, when it extended the period its common position was to remain in force by six months, once more appealing to the Burmese government to embark on swift and concrete action for the promotion of respect for human rights and democratic and national harmony."
"The Council has declared its full support for the UN Secretary-General' s special envoy, Alvaro De Soto, in his forthcoming duties, and decided to review its common position on the basis of the results of his work."
"The Council is not doing terribly well, is it?"
"That is a very disappointing reply."
"I was asked to raise this question by the Penzance branch of Amnesty International, which has taken under its wing a particular prisoner of conscience, Thet Win Aung."
"I mention his name because he is a very good example of what is happening in Burma."
"He is a student leader who was recently sentenced to 52 years of imprisonment, and this has now been increased to 59 years."
"He was arrested in October 1998."
"His place of detention is not known and his family is being put under terrible pressure."
"My question to the Council is, given this awful background, is it willing to consider putting pressure upon Burma to declare a total amnesty for such political prisoners and, very much to the point, has the Council ever discussed the possibility of economic sanctions against Burma until it adopts a more humane policy?"
"Mr President, as I have already said, Burma' s internal political situation is by no means acceptable to the Union, as there is no acknowledgement in that country of fundamental human rights."
"At present the Council is monitoring the situation and, as I stated, we have a common position on Burma, which - if I am not entirely mistaken - also includes certain economic sanctions."
"I can assure the honourable Member that the Council will do all it can and put pressure on the Burmese government, so that the situation in Burma can be normalised and improved, and so that human rights will be respected in the future."
"Question No 10 by (H-0572/99):"
"Subject: Conditions for the inclusion of Turkey among countries eligible for membership of the European Union The European Union refused to embark upon pre-accession negotiations with Slovakia and the Baltic States because they did not fulfil the Copenhagen criteria concerning democratic freedoms and respect for minorities."
"Their impending recognition as countries eligible for accession comes after significant constitutional, legal and political reforms."
"Will the European Council meeting in Helsinki also pursue the same policy towards Turkey?"
"Does the Finnish Presidency consider that the basic conditions for recognising Turkey as eligible for membership of the European Union should at least comprise dropping the demand for international recognition of a >Turkish-Cypriot state= in the occupied territories of the Republic of Cyprus in order to launch intercommunal talks, Turkey=s agreement to seek settlements of the differences between Greece and Turkey on the basis of international law and its institutions, and the opening of talks on the democratic and cultural rights of the Kurds?"
"Mr President, the Council would like to stress that the criteria agreed at the European Council in Copenhagen affect in the same way all countries seeking EU membership."
"The Council would remind everyone that the European Council in Luxembourg stated that Turkey would be assessed according to the same criteria as the other applicant countries."
"The European Council furthermore reminded everyone that, in order to strengthen relations between Turkey and the EU, there would be a need for political and social reforms, such as respect and protection for minorities, the creation of satisfactory and stable relations between Greece and Turkey and support for the talks being conducted under UN protection on a political solution in Cyprus."
"We are aware that decisions on enlargement taken at the European Council in Helsinki, which will be made with reference to the Commission' s annual report will have a powerful impact on relations between the EU and Turkey."
"Although we cannot predict the outcome of the talks in Helsinki, and although there is still much scope for improvement with regard to Turkey, it seems reasonable to reflect on the many important areas of progress that have been made, which should be taken into consideration."
"The outcome of the informal meeting of foreign ministers at Saariselkä, which was set forth on 13 September in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council, and Foreign Minister Cem' s presence at the General Affairs Council' s lunch are, in the opinion of the country to hold the Presidency, signs of a constructive new beginning in relations between the Union and Turkey."
"Improved relations between Greece and Turkey, not just as a result of the earthquakes, but as an issue in itself, and a discernible change in attitude in Turkey with regard to legal and constitutional reform, human rights and the Turkish Kurds are very welcome steps forward, as are also the commitments and recognition of realities contained in Bülent Ecevit' s letter to Chancellor Gerhard Schröder last May."
"The representative of the Council' s response is ambiguous and somewhat schizophrenic in nature. On the one hand, he says that we need to implement the criteria but, on the other hand, he says things are running smoothly in Turkey and so we can proceed."
"This is clear to us all."
"Nevertheless, I would like to take the discussion a little further."
"At one point, he referred to a number of things Turkey must still do. ""there is still much scope for improvement with regard to Turkey"" , the Minister said."
"How much scope for improvement is there in Turkey?"
"Is Turkey really ready to be granted applicant status on the basis of what it has done today and the declarations it has made?"
"As regards fundamental issues such as the Greek-Turkish dispute over the Aegean Sea, should the criteria not be for Turkey to recognise the opinions of other countries, but for it to respect international law, to refrain from using violence or threatening to use violence and to refer any disputes it may have to the International Court in The Hague."
"Mr President, this autumn I myself went to Turkey and had talks there on the state of human rights in that country."
"I expressed the Union' s clear position on the unsatisfactory situation we see regarding human rights there."
"I would like to say, however, that a constructive attitude to Turkey is likely to be a much better policy for the Union than would be the case if Turkey turned its back on the Union entirely and did not even try to embrace those principles that we have incorporated as conditions of membership in the Copenhagen criteria or in other decisions we have taken."
"I firmly believe that if Turkey were accorded applicant status in Helsinki, it would increase Turkey' s willingness and its efforts to put its own house in order relatively quickly, especially with regard to human rights and the police."
"We must remember that, before a state can join the Union, the human rights situation in respect of those living there obviously has to be impeccable."
"I also want to point out that the Cyprus question is naturally an important part of all of this."
"I believe that this perspective on membership has contributed to the fact that talks will probably very soon begin on how to solve the Cyprus problem."
"It is my understanding that Rauf Denktash has promised he is ready to come to the negotiating table in New York, and this would obviously be a very positive sign."
"I believe that we will achieve better results through constructive cooperation than by cutting the ties of cooperation."
"Mr President, I rise not because of the topic of Mr Alavanos' question, but to comment on Minister Sasi' s answer and to put a question to him. Minister Sasi, perhaps you should have said that this was more of a political debate and that a conclusion would be reached in Helsinki."
"Instead you addressed many different issues under the same heading and no clear conclusion can be drawn from what you said."
"I would like to ask a question."
"You made the particular point about Turkey being judged on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria. If Turkey is therefore accorded applicant status in Helsinki, are we then to assume that it has fulfilled those criteria?"
"Please answer us that."
"We should not be bothering ourselves with all these other factors. Instead, we should try to talk some sense here."
"I am saying all this, Mr President, because I believe that when the Council comes here, it should have more respect for this institution."
"We are parliamentarians after all!"
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to say that Turkey at present does not meet the Copenhagen criteria, but neither do we intend to make a decision in Helsinki on commencing talks with Turkey, which is what is being planned at this moment for Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria."
"In other words, it is not a question of actually starting talks, but of establishing applicant status and taking subsequent action."
"I believe that it is realistic to say that Turkey still has a rather long way to go before concrete negotiations on membership can begin."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would not describe the response as being schizophrenic in nature, I would just like to know, as we all would, whether the strengthening of relations between the European Union and Turkey is a high priority for the Council, and whether it is such a high priority that those conditions set by the Council to ensure this strengthening of relations are actually being brushed aside."
"You said, Mr President-in-Office, that Turkey' s position had changed."
"How has Turkey' s position changed exactly?"
"Turkish forces still occupy the northern part of Cyprus, political rights are still being violated, Öçalan is still in prison and Kurdish people are not even given recognition."
"You also talk of some promise of negotiations."
"Indeed, there is such a promise, as regards the Cyprus issue, but it would cost Turkey nothing to begin negotiations, to talk for 15 minutes and then to have done with it. At the same time, this would give the Council good enough reason to say ""There!"
"We have now made some progress on the Cyprus issue"" ."
"Mr President, I would like to say that Turkey certainly has implemented action this year to try and improve human rights, but the truth is that it obviously still has a long way to go in this area, and change does not come quickly in any society."
"On the whole, I believe that cooperation is a better way to build peace that an unwillingness to practise cooperation."
"Question No 11 by (H-0602/99):"
"Subject: Restrictions imposed by Turkey on freedom of navigation On 27 May 1997 the Turkish authorities issued Decision No 2646, signed by Mr Nazmi Kumral (Minister of State of the Marine) prohibiting merchant vessels flying the Cypriot flag or belonging to citizens of Cyprus or of other countries, including the 15 Member States of the European Union, from entering Turkey if they are proceeding from or to any port in the unoccupied area of the Republic of Cyprus."
"The Republic of Cyprus, on the other hand, which is a victim of Turkish aggression, 37% of it being under illegal Turkish military occupation, has not imposed any limits on entry into its ports by vessels from Turkey."
"Does the Council consider these restrictions imposed by Turkey to be in accordance with EU principles and does the Council consider it acceptable for a country aspiring to EU membership to take such action against vessels flying the flags of EU Member States?"
"Mr President, the Council believes that the Turkish action affects the interests of merchant vessels flying a Member State flag and operating between Turkey and Cyprus, and private vessels owned by shipping companies in the Community."
"In addition, these restrictions do not accord with the basic principles of trade and free competition at sea based on integrity and commercialism as accepted by Turkey within the framework of the OECD."
"For this reason, numerous official communications have been sent to the Turkish authorities."
"Mr President, I consider it a positive sign that there have been remonstrations against Turkey but I would also like to stress my disappointment that what Turkey is doing to the detriment of merchant fleets around the world, including the merchant fleets of the European Union, is being played down."
"Since Turkey has taken no direct action, it is in violation of international law, the rules of free navigation and the treaties of the European Union."
"What Turkey is in fact doing is prohibiting vessels proceeding from Cypriot ports from approaching Turkish ports."
"This does not just refer to vessels which are actually from Cyprus or Greece, which would have roused particular interest, but it also refers to European Union vessels."
"I would like to ask what response Turkey gave to the European Union' s remonstrations and if it gave no response at all, why then does it not take the matter to the International Court in the Hague?"
"I also wonder why the European Union is prepared to tolerate such unlawfulness and harm the interests of European shipping for a country which does not even have any qualms about threatening a superpower, i.e. the United States, just to defend its banana trade."
"Mr President, the contentious decision of the Turkish Government is yet another example of Turkey' s total disregard for and blatant violation of maritime law following the Turkish Grand National Assembly authorising the Turkish Government to claim casus belli and to declare war on Greece should Greece exercise its rights to extend its territorial waters in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which only Turkey has refused to sign. In light of this, I would like to ask the Council if it intends to address this particular issue in its remonstrations to Ankara as well as at the forthcoming European Council in Helsinki in the discussions on EU-Turkey relations and the criteria which, as the Minister said, must be fulfilled."
"Mr President, as I said, the Commission intends to raise this matter in the bilateral discussions on reaching a preferential agreement on the liberalisation of services and public procurement between the EU and Turkey."
"Furthermore, the Council can take up this matter in discussions with Turkey, but there will not be any negotiations as such with Turkey at the Helsinki Summit, so the matter will hardly be brought up there."
"Question No 12 by (H-0576/99):"
"Subject: Substance abusers and methods of treatment An increasing number of substance abusers also have mental problems which, quite clearly, entail difficulties for themselves and difficulties finding effective methods of treatment."
"In the Council=s view, how should we tackle this growing problem?"
"- (SV) There has been no proposal submitted to the Council relating to the question asked by the honourable Member."
"Finding suitable methods of treatment is, moreover, a matter which falls mainly within the Member States' area of responsibility."
"Thank you very much for your answer."
"I am aware of the fact that this matter falls within the Member States' area of responsibility, but we nonetheless know that it is a shared problem which is not just a question of methods of treatment in general but precisely about the combination of substance abuse and mental illnesses."
"I know that the Finnish presidency has had mental health as one of a number of topics in its programme."
"I am therefore wondering now whether one might contemplate opening the doors to more explicit cooperation in connection with the problematic situation in which many people are diagnosed as having a combination of substance abuse and mental health problems."
"As has been said, this matter comes within the Member States' area of responsibility."
"At the same time, there is no reason why it should not be possible to discuss the issue at the meeting of the health ministers and, in that way, then try to create some type of, not perhaps cooperation, but contacts, and perhaps exchange information from different countries in an attempt to develop the methods concerned in different EU countries."
"I must admit that I am no expert in this area of responsibility."
"I cannot unfortunately give a clearer answer."
"Question No 13 by (H-0578/99):"
"Subject: Growing federalism in EU decision making Speaking in Strasbourg in July as a representative of the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council, Finland=s Foreign Minister stated one of Finland=s objectives as being to ensure that the Union had a common will, a common policy and a common voice."
"On this basis a policy is being developed within the Council which will increase the federalisation of the EU: common decision-making bodies in which supranational decisions are taken."
"What is the Council=s position on a federalism which would compel countries to surrender their right of veto and qualified-majority requirements in order to facilitate supranational decision making?"
"Mr President, the Council, like the other institutions, exercises its powers according to those conditions and for those purposes that are defined in Article 5 of the EC Treaty and in the provisions of later agreements and documents relating to amendments and additions, on the one hand, and the provisions of the Treaty on the European Union, on the other."
"The voting rules contained in these agreements apply when decisions are made in the Council."
"Extending the scope of application of decisions based on a qualified majority in the Council is one of those issues to be discussed at the conference of the representatives of Member State governments, which is to convene at the beginning of 2000."
"The European Council took a decision on the matter at its meeting at Cologne on 3 and 4 June 1999."
"In the Protocol relating to the institutions and EU enlargement and which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there are provisions for convening this Intergovernmental Conference."
"The honourable Member' s question thus does not fall within the area of responsibility of the Council but of that of the conference of representatives of Member State governments."
"I would just like to follow up the response from the President-in-Office of the Council to this question by mentioning the Luxembourg Compromise which we do not hear much of now."
"The question is asked - the opinion of the Council about federalism - about surrendering sovereignty to majority voting."
"Is the Luxembourg Compromise still regarded as being in force and being respected and would you not agree that it should be?"
"I mean the compromise by which it is understood that the vital national interests of a Member State will not be overruled by a majority vote in Council."
"That is my understanding of that compromise."
"Mr President, a compromise was made in Luxembourg at the time, and it is in principle still in force, although it might be said that no one has recently insisted that it be applied."
"Perhaps we should also mention that after that the Ioannina compromise was made."
"Question No 14 by (H-0583/99):"
"Subject: Brominated flame retardants There have recently been alarming reports in Sweden of high levels of brominated flame retardants in fish in the Baltic."
"The Swedish government has promised to ban brominated flame retardants in 2004 and to press for reductions in their use."
"How does the Council intend to deal with the problem of brominated flame retardants?"
"Does it intend to seek a ban at EU level, and if so, when?"
"Would a unilateral Swedish ban on brominated fire retardants be regarded as hampering the free movement of goods and thus as an infringement of EU law?"
"The President-in-Office of the Council has the floor to respond to this question."
"We trust in the wisdom of the Council."
"- (SV) The honourable Member has asked a question concerning the high levels of brominated flame retardants in fish in the Baltic."
"As the Member is aware, the Council has promulgated legislation which makes it possible to assess and reduce the risks to the environment and to people' s health constituted by hazardous substances."
"Furthermore, the Council' s conclusions concerning the further development of the European Community' s policy on chemicals were adopted by the Council - that is to say, the Council on the Environment - on 24 June of this year."
"In these conclusions, the Council urges the Commission to submit a document concerning the new strategy on chemicals before the end of the year 2000."
"This document ought to include an outline of a new strategy for improving the identification and assessment of all chemicals."
"Thank you for your answer, which it was also very nice to have in Swedish."
"I perhaps understand why the answer was as it was, but this business with fish in the Baltic is just one example of how brominated flame retardants can cause problems for the environment and for people' s health."
"We know, you see, that these flame retardants have been used quite freely since the beginning of the seventies in electronic equipment, TV sets, computers etc, and they have just proliferated."
"This is an enormous problem because Swedish studies, and other studies too, show that we are going to see precisely the same thing happen as we saw happen with PCBs, namely that these chemicals will find their way into the food chains and it will gradually emerge that a big problem has arisen."
"I should like an answer to the question of whether Sweden would be able to take a decision to prohibit these substances by the year 2004 and whether the EU would be able to agree to this; that is to say, would the precautionary principle prevail?"
"- (SV) Since I am not familiar with the investigation concerning the dangers to which these substances give rise, I must say that I cannot, unfortunately, reply directly to the question of whether arrangements should be made to prohibit the use of such substances."
"I should like, nonetheless, to refer to the Council' s conclusions, to which I also referred in my first reply and which I can also send to you if you wish."
"In accordance with the general programme in Council Regulation no 793/93 concerning the assessment and monitoring of risks presented by existing substances, three brominated flame retardants are at present under investigation."
"If required, the Commission will submit proposals concerning Community measures to reduce the risks to which these substances give rise."
"Other specific questions which have also been asked in this context fall within the Commission' s area of authority, and the Commission, in its capacity as administrator of the Community' s policy, also has access to the tools and information which are needed if reliable and up-to-date answers are to be given."
"When it comes to being able to prohibit these substances, I believe, finally, that the Commission must be asked for its answer to this question."
"Question No 15 by (H-0585/99):"
"Subject: Ban on fuel supplies and looming humanitarian disaster in Yugoslavia The European Union=s opposition, expressed notably at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg, to providing fuel and emergency aid for the inhabitants of Yugoslavia to enable them to face the coming winter and the final decision to export heating oil B a plan called Energy for Democracy B to two Serb cities, Nis and Pirot, which are under opposition control, has provoked strong reactions."
"This decision not only condemns the inhabitants of Yugoslavia to spend the winter entirely deprived of essential heating fuel, following the massive damage inflicted on state infrastructures by NATO bombing, but it is also an insult to the pride of an entire people who are the victims of extortion and who are facing annihilation because the West does not approve of their political leadership."
"Does the Council consider that statements of this kind reflect the position of the European Union and the so-called international community as regards respect for fundamental democratic freedoms and values? Does it consider further that the blackmailing decision of Luxembourg is a message which promotes democracy, in view of the fact that it seeks to bludgeon a people and its political representatives into adopting anti-democratic practices in order to survive, instead of ensuring that the institutions function in a smooth and democratic manner in the forthcoming elections?"
"Mr President, on 15 November the General Affairs Council declared its support for the democratic opposition in Serbia, and its attempts at unification."
"In addition, it said once more that the Union was ready to offer reconstruction aid to a democratic Serbia."
"The General Affairs Council noted with satisfaction that the first deliveries of heating oil for the two cities of Nis and Pirot under the ""Energy for Democracy"" programme would take place before the end of November."
"It requires the projects to be swiftly implemented, and the Council reconfirmed its readiness to consider extending the initiative to other communities."
"The Council also reminded everyone of its readiness to continue to help destitute Serbs and of the humanitarian aid granted by the European Community and the Member States for this purpose."
"The 'self-help aid' granted by ECHO to Serbia will total EUR 62 million, which the Council welcomed at its meeting."
"Regarding the elections to be held in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Council thinks that, under the present circumstances, the idea of free and honestly conducted elections is impossible."
"Police attacks at peaceful demonstrations, which were carried out repeatedly in Belgrade in October, clearly show that the basic values of democracy, such as freedom of speech and opinion, will not be respected in Serbia as long as Milosevic and his government are in power there."
"Mr President, if I am not mistaken, the Council called its programme ""Energy for Democracy"" ."
"Now we are saying that it is simply humanitarian intervention."
"The phrase ""Energy for Democracy"" itself denotes shameless extortion of the Serbian people, since in order to get heating fuel, they must accept the ideas of European Union democracy."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on and ask the representative of the Council the following: he says that the European Union will not recognise the Milosevic regime and that fair elections cannot take place until judgements have been passed on the political powers of Yugoslavia, of Serbia."
"So, what are your plans?"
"Have you reached a deadlock?"
"Do you have any other plans in the pipeline that you are not telling Parliament?"
"What are we to make of your intentions since, in your view, elections are not the answer?"
"Even rallies have been banned....May I tell you that in Greece today, with the visit of President Clinton, half of Athens has been cordoned off for two or three days?"
"Mr President, it is absolutely clear that free democratic elections in Yugoslavia are the only solution to the situation there."
"But in reply I would say that, at present, circumstances in Yugoslavia, taking into consideration, for example police action and the aggressive attitude towards demonstrations, as well as the Milosevic administration' s attitude towards the press and freedom of information, are such that the conditions for holding free democratic elections in Yugoslavia do no exist right at present."
"The basis of Union policy is that it has no desire to support the Milosevic administration in any way whatsoever."
"As the Union considers humanitarian factors to be very important, however, and does not accept that the deeds of leaders should mean that ordinary citizens have to suffer, it has embarked on a trial project, whereby heating oil will be delivered on a trial basis to Nis and Pirot, but possibly later on to other places as well."
"We await with interest that the Yugoslavian government and administration approve these aid measures, as at present we do not have any good experience whatsoever of the government."
"Passage along the Danube should be freed up as quickly as possible, but achieving cooperation in this respect has not been possible, and Yugoslavia has not embarked on any action to open up the Danube, although it has an obligation to do so under international agreements."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, may I thank you for the clear opinion you have expressed."
"I can really only register with indignation the fact that Mr Theonas is displaying sympathy here for a war criminal."
"I should like, however, to ask you quite specifically what the Council - apart from these sanctions, which I fully and completely approve of - is planning to do in order to provide concrete support to the Serbian opposition this winter."
"Is a meeting planned, and are there concrete measures to support the Serbian democratic opposition?"
"For that would be of use to the Serbian people!"
"I would ask Members to address the Council with questions and not to make statements regarding the likes or dislikes of other Members because these naturally call for a response."
"I am going to give Mr Theonas the floor for 15 seconds and I would ask him not to cause a parliamentary incident."
"I know that he will not cause one because I know him."
"I would ask all Members to adhere to the Rules of Procedure and address questions to the Council."
"Mr President, I would like to invite Mr Posselt to retract his congratulations, otherwise I shall be forced into thinking that he despises an entire people for not accepting his views on democracy."
"We should not hate the Serb population just because he wants the right to determine who should lead the country."
"I am sure that Mr Posselt has no intention of showing disrespect for Mr Theonas' positions and has no difficulty in expressing it."
"This is a purely political debate."
"Has everybody received an answer and are you satisfied?"
"The Council will take the floor to answer this supplementary question."
"Mr Sasi has the floor."
"Mr President, the Union has aspired to cooperation with the democratic forces in Serbia."
"In October, with this purpose in mind, the General Affairs Council invited representatives of the Serbian democratic opposition to a meeting, and the Yugoslavian situation was discussed with them."
"We also heard their hopes regarding what sort of action the Union might take in this matter."
"Among other things, sanctions were discussed, but there was also much discussion about freedom of the media and press, which at present is restricted, meaning that they cannot operate in a democratic fashion in the country."
"It is also possible that there will be contact between the Union and the Serbian democratic opposition in the meeting that is just starting in Istanbul."
"Our bottom line - and there is complete consensus on this, as far as I know - is that a democratic administration should be established for Yugoslavia, and Serbia in particular, as soon as possible, one that the people have been able to elect in their own free elections, without pressure or restriction."
"Question No 16 by (H-0586/99):"
"Subject: Financial Instrument of the OCTs (Overseas Countries and Territories) One of the objectives set by the Amsterdam Conference for the Council was to increase the effectiveness of the financial instrument of the OCTs."
"The EDF mechanism no longer seems to be able to meet the needs expressed by the OCT authorities."
"The main criticisms voiced are that they do not receive sufficient funding compared with the ACP countries, and that the procedures are excessively bureaucratic and totally untailored to local structures."
"Parliament had called specifically for the establishment of a European Development Fund for the OCTs (OCTDF) in its resolution of 11 February 1999."
"Does the Council intend to take into account our demand in the new association agreement which is due to enter into force on 1 March 2000?"
"Mr President, when the Treaty of Amsterdam was signed on 2 October 1997, the Intergovernmental Conference added in its final act a declaration regarding the Overseas Countries and Territories."
"This declaration exhorts the Council to examine by February 2000 the association system of the OCTs in compliance with the provisions of Article 136 of the EC Treaty."
"One of the aims of this investigation is to improve the effectiveness of the financial instrument of the OCTs."
"On the basis of a resolution passed on 11 February 1999 by the European Parliament, the Commission, on 25 May 1999, delivered a communication to the Council, which formulated three possible ways of improving this financial instrument."
"They are OCD aid eligibility with regard to Structural Funds, a revised EDF, or a fund specially intended for OCDs in the Union budget."
"The Council noted these possible guidelines, but did not say it favoured any one of them at this stage."
"The Council will be debating the details of an improved financial instrument for OCDs once it has its possession, in the near future, the awaited Commission proposal on a definition of the new association system for OCDs to be applied on 1 March 2000."
"Obviously, the Council will take account of the resolution passed by the European Parliament on 11 February 1999 when it debates this proposal."
"I would like to tell the Minister that I do not find his answer very satisfactory."
"What we are actually facing is the need to have a new association agreement that must come into force on 1 March 2000 and I am a little surprised that, at this stage, no decision has yet been taken on the three guidelines, on the three paths that have been sketched out."
"I would like to ask the Council how, when these paths are sketched out, it intends to link, as it were, Parliament with the definition of this new financial instrument, because there is no doubt that a new financial instrument will be needed because what exists at the moment is no longer suitable for the situation of the overseas countries and territories and does not match up to these countries' requirements."
"Mr President, I would just like to say and assure the honourable Member that the Council is fully aware that it is necessary to simplify the financial instrument for Overseas Countries and Territories and make it more efficient but, as I said, at present, we only have a communication from the Commission that proposes three different possible approaches."
"For this reason, it will be some time before a final decision is taken on the matter."
"Thank you very much, Mr Sasi."
"Questions 17 and 18 were not going to be dealt with because they refer to the matter of Chechnya, which was included in today' s agenda."
"Since the time allocated to Questions to the Council has elapsed, questions 19 to 41 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Thank you very much, good night and I hope that you will enjoy Strasbourg after a hard day at work."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.05 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I should like to ask you to protest vehemently on behalf of all of us at the savage and brutal public execution on Tuesday of a mother of seven children by the Taliban regime in Kabul."
"I will say no more, but I am disgusted - we must all be disgusted - at this savagery."
"Please protest on behalf of all of us."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mrs Doyle, I read this report myself and I must tell you I was outraged and shocked."
"I believe your applause is a clear indication of the fact that we are all in agreement that I should announce the indignation of this House to Afghanistan."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madame President, I have a problem with yesterday' s Minutes."
"They refer to me as 'Mr' ."
"I gave an explanation of vote on Avilés Perea' s report on the Daphne programme, I am referred to in the Minutes as 'Herr' Kauppi, and I would prefer it to read 'Madame' ."
"Well, I am quite dismayed at all these errors, which are obviously technical errors."
"All the same, they are not acceptable, and we shall straighten all this out."
"Madam President, on page 20 of the Minutes, it is announced that I spoke in support of Mr Dupuis."
"Well, we are colleagues, and often agree, but that is not the point."
"Both Mr Dupuis' speech and my own were intended to challenge the request made by the chair, Mr Barón Crespo, regarding the application of Rule 112."
"Hence the request I made was addressed to the chair so that its validity could be evaluated and we could be told this morning what the state of affairs was."
"Very well, Mr Dell' Alba."
"That is what I am here for."
"Madam President, yesterday's Minutes in the English also seem to indicate that they were the Minutes of Thursday 17 December."
"I am sure that Parliament would not be writing today's Minutes before we have actually had our debates and votes."
"I hope that will be corrected."
"No, of course, I can assure you immediately that that is not the case."
"It is indeed an error."
"Madam President, I want to refer to your expression of sympathy with the people of France who are affected by severe flooding."
"It was very appropriate that you should raise this matter yesterday morning."
"But you not only expressed sympathy, you also requested the Commission to provide some assistance."
"Sometimes in Parliament the right hand does not know what the left one is doing."
"A couple of years ago we took away the possibility of extending assistance to people in such instances in the European Union."
"We expressed the same sympathy with the Greeks and requested the same assistance, but there is no money available."
"We ought therefore in future to either provide the money and the conditions under which it is paid or cease to ask the Commission to give assistance."
"What we gave the Greeks was an empty cup. We are offering the same thing to the people of France."
"Thank you, Mr McCartin."
"Indeed, I had to mention the same problem when opening yesterday' s sitting."
"Madam President, I would like to table a procedural motion."
"I failed to notice that we had moved on from the procedural motions to the report."
"I would like to raise a minor motion on something that could be deemed insignificant, but as each day passes, I get increasingly frustrated at the crazy amounts of paper being wasted in this establishment."
"It is not just a lot of energy on words that is being wasted here, there is an incredible amount of paper wasted and there is no sign of any kind of recycling scheme."
"At the other Parliament based in Brussels, we at least have cardboard boxes where we can deposit the massive amounts of paper which we no longer need."
"At this end, despite the ultra-modern and sophisticated design of this building, I have as yet been unable to detect the existence of such practical, inexpensive cardboard boxes which can play a key role in the recycling of paper."
"I would like to ask you to make a little effort here."
"Surely, the budget could stretch to a few cardboard boxes for the Members where we can stock paper for recycling purposes."
"Thank you, Mr Vander Taelen, for this contribution which is indeed not strictly relevant to the Minutes."
"But that does not matter."
"It is a perfectly valid point which I shall pass on to the College of Quaestors this very day to see if we can find appropriate solutions to the problem you have brought up."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Madam President, I was waiting for the vote on the Minutes to be completed before responding to Mr Vander Taelen."
"You will all have noted that each of the waste bins is marked to show what it is to be used for, so there is in fact a specific paper and card bin."
"So we do have this kind of sorting of waste in Parliament at Strasbourg."
"Report (A5-0066/1999) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)"
"President."
"I have received a request for urgent procedure, in accordance with Rule 112 of the Rules of Procedure, from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"The request for urgent procedure is motivated by the fact that it is imperative to respect the interinstitutional commitments on OLAF, implemented by the other institutions concerned."
"Thank you, Mr Barón Crespo."
"I think that Mr Dupuis will have the opportunity to respond to you, since he has signed up to speak against this request."
"Mr Barón Crespo has just presented the request. Mr Poettering is asking for the floor to speak in favour of this request."
"Madam President, I must comment here."
"First of all, I can say that our colleague Barón Crespo, whom I would describe not as an accomplice, but in all our political differences as an esteemed colleague, has given a correct account of the situation, as I explained orally to him, that we also, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, wish for a vote to be taken on the Napolitano report."
"I gave this explanation orally to Baron Crespo, but did not sign the proposal, because just before his request that I sign it, I had a conversation with a representative of your Office."
"As the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we said that we could and wished to help to carry it, if the problems in the Napolitano report are resolved to a certain extent and they are indeed at the limit so that we can also vote, although in no way are we really happy with the situation."
"We said that we wished to conclude this tiresome business in November."
"And we keep to our word."
"But it is of course the responsibility of the President of the Parliament to ensure that the procedures run properly."
"We assume that the urgent procedure can be dealt with in accordance with the rules."
"On this basis we support the vote on Thursday, that is to say, today, so that we can bring this tiresome matter to a close."
"But we expect that everything is in order with regard to the formal procedure."
"Thank you, Mr Poettering."
"Yes, I believe that if the vote were to take place tomorrow, on Friday, we would have some trouble in mustering the 314 votes necessary."
"But you never know!"
"Madam President, I think that Mr Voggenhuber wishes to speak against this proposal."
"I am myself speaking to say that this request in inadmissible, insofar as Rule 112 refers to Rule 60, which is about Commission proposals and legislative texts."
"Mr Barón Crespo has a very flexible view of our Rules of Procedure."
"Yesterday he spoke of Rule 60, today he is talking about Rule 61, on constitutional matters."
"Those present may observe the rich nature of Strasbourg nights and their capacity to cause our internal regulations to increase in number."
"In the preamble to Mr Napolitano' s report, there is explicit reference to Article 199 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and this Article refers explicitly to the Rules of Procedure of the Parliament."
"This is, then, further evidence that the procedure that Mr Barón Crespo requested yesterday has nothing to do with Rule 112."
"I therefore request, Madam President, that there should be no vote and that Mr Barón Crespo' s request is considered inadmissible."
"Very well, thank you, Mr Dupuis."
"Mr Dupuis has just spoken regarding the admissibility of this request."
"Mr Dupuis, you will not be surprised to hear that I spent some time last night studying this matter."
"And I came to the conclusion that the request was perfectly admissible according to the Rules of Procedure."
"Well, we have heard your views."
"I now give the floor to Mr Voggenhuber, to speak against the request."
"Madam President, I am sorry to have to contradict you afterwards."
"I am of completely the opposite opinion."
"Rule 112 speaks quite clearly of a debate on a proposal on which the opinion of the Parliament is required."
"It is quite clear that we are dealing here with an amendment to the Rules of Procedure."
"It is not a matter of the interinstitutional agreement."
"That is not the subject of the Napolitano amendment."
"It is rather an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and it is quite clear that it does not formally come under Rule 112."
"It is therefore politically so important because the Rules of Procedure of this House should be protected from being amended ad hoc and according to individual situations."
"That is a safeguard of the Rules of Procedure, that it does not fall under Rule 112."
"It is the case in all national parliaments that Rules of Procedure cannot just be amended according to the mood of the moment."
"The procedure that leads to this debate and to this decision - in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well - shows a large number of infringements of the Rules of Procedure."
"Proposals were declared inadmissible that were clearly admissible under the Rules of Procedure."
"It was omitted to set deadlines for proposals for amendment."
"The large groups have tried to bring about this proposal through the repeated deliberate disregard of the Rules of Procedure."
"I am therefore very surprised because the EPP started a discussion with the refusal of the qualified majority on the last vote in this House, which showed many Members that in this interinstitutional agreement there is associated damage to the rights of Parliament, serious damage to the independent mandate and a limitation of the constitutional role of this House"
"The EPP was quite justified in sending this report back to the Committee again."
"It is therefore incomprehensible that now, in view of the serious constitutional problems that this report raises, a course of action is chosen that is not covered by the Rules of Procedure."
"Nobody in this House - to make it clear once and for all - would speak out against expanding the efforts to combat fraud and on the responsibility of OLAF for this House."
"But the fact that the Council has gone too far and has undermined the position of Parliament and openly questioned the independent mandate, the fact that investigations can be carried out against independent Members of this House, because of undetermined legal notions - serious incidents -, because of a disciplinary law that does not exist, has rightly alarmed this house."
"(Applause)"
"I would ask you to note, Madam President, that this debate cannot now be concluded forcibly and by breaching the Rules of Procedure."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, matters seem clear enough, as much as they can be."
"Rule 112 of our Rules of Procedure refers to Rule 60(1), ""A request that a debate on a proposal on which Parliament has been consulted pursuant to Rule 60(1) be treated as urgent..."""
"And Rule 60(1) specifies, ""Proposals from the Commission and other documents of a legislative nature"" ."
"The problem of interpretation is focused on the nature of Mr Napolitano' s report."
"As far as I am concerned, I consider - and once again this is what has influenced my thinking, but I shall ask Mr Napolitano if he agrees with me - that the subject of Mr Napolitano' s report is the application of a text of a legislative nature, since it is to do with the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the inquiries carried out by OLAF."
"Considering that Mr Napolitano' s report concerns a text of a legislative nature, it seems to me that we are in the situation covered by Rule 60(1), as referred to by Rule 112 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I hope I have made this sufficiently clear."
"Mr Napolitano, could you tell me if you share my opinion?"
"Madam President, I completely agree with the definition that you gave of the mandate given to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, a very specific and limited mandate."
"It is simply a question of inserting the interinstitutional agreement into our Rules of Procedure, and I therefore agree with what you said about the nature of the report."
"Agenda"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to spend all morning on this."
"We have heard Mr Barón Crespo presenting the request, and Mr Poettering speaking in favour of this request."
"Now I would like to know if there is any Member who wishes to speak against this request."
"If there is no speaker against, I shall put the matter to the vote directly."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"This item is now entered as the first item on today' s agenda."
"Madam President, I am sorry to have to request your attention for a moment."
"Once again, on the agenda."
"With the decision that we have now taken, that is to say, to place the Napolitano report on the agenda, there is a problem for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"We have on the agenda the report by Mr Pirker on Eurodac, a report that is extremely controversial and which yesterday gave rise to controversial discussions in the Social Democratic Group, which led me to request the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, yesterday evening, to agree to the vote being adjourned until Brussels."
"Understandably he did not agree to this. With the decision that the plenary sitting has now taken, i.e. to place the Napolitano report on the agenda, it is foreseeable that we shall neither be able to complete the discussion of the Pirker report nor therefore will we be able to vote on it today."
"That would mean that we would have to vote on such an important report a) extremely controversially and b) with a very small number of Members present."
"That is not appropriate for the subject of this report."
"I would therefore ask you, Madam President, to support my proposal for a vote that we remove this report from the agenda today in view of the situation and adjourn it until the December part-session in Brussels."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are going to hear from the rapporteur on the establishment of EURODAC, Mr Pirker, who has asked to be given the floor."
"Madam President, just to clarify something to start with: We have been discussing the Eurodac report, that is to say, a system of control on the Member States' responsibility for dealing with asylum and combating asylum abuse, for almost a year now and in spring this year the Social Democrats and the Greens, and others at the last minute, although they had previously been in favour of the introduction of the system, changed tack and came out against the introduction of Eurodac, then in the form of the Convention and the Protocol."
"That was out of the question and an unreasonable demand, because we need solutions."
"Now, in the autumn, we have opened the debate with a Council Regulation."
"We have discussed it at length in the Committee and are in full agreement with the Social Democrats and with the others, with the exception of the Greens who want to fight the system as a whole, that we need Eurodac."
"On the vote in the Committee there were no proposals for amendment, but rather full agreement with the Social Democrats and also with the Liberals and with all the others that Eurodac must be set up."
"We must have this discussion and bring it to a conclusion."
"That means that the same might happen as in the spring, that the Social Democrats will suddenly change tack for obscure reasons and suddenly vote against Eurodac, then they would bear the entire responsibility for us failing to have a well-ordered European system dealing with asylum or a system to combat abuse."
"They would bear the sole political responsibility for this."
"(Applause)"
"If this report is going to be discussed then I would ask that we ensure that it be discussed today and that we also vote on it today."
"That must be our goal."
"We would only allow one exception to that."
"If against all expectations it does not come to that and the only alternative we had was to vote on it tomorrow, then it would be necessary to hold the vote in plenary sitting."
"I would therefore ask you to ensure that we can discuss it and vote on it today, because there is no time to lose."
"We need a system for a common asylum procedure and to combat abuse in Europe and I have no time for party political games to the detriment of this issue."
"(Applause)"
"I quite understand what you have said, Mr Pirker."
"I think that Mr Watson, the chairman of the Committee concerned, now wishes to make a statement."
"This proposal for a Council Regulation is an important proposal."
"My committee has worked very hard to prepare Parliament's response to this proposal in time for the deadline set down by the Council and in time for the Council to discuss it on 2 December."
"If we have time to debate this report this morning, then we must vote at lunch-time."
"This will enable Parliament to give its response in time for the Council to discuss it."
"However, if we are not able to have this debate this morning, if there are too many speakers down for the Napolitano report and the Giannakou report, then I would support Mr Pirker's proposal that we not vote on the matter tomorrow."
"It is too important a matter to be voted on a Friday, even though I personally will be here."
"I am not sure whether those who, as I understand it, have a problem with the report, such as the French delegation in the Socialist Group, will still be here tomorrow - we might ask them that."
"However, if it is not to possible to vote on it today, might we ask the services of Parliament whether it would be possible to have the debate this evening and the vote on the Wednesday of the December part-session to allow us to forward the results to the Council by the Thursday; and might we also ask for the assistance of the Commissioner in intervening with the Council on this matter?"
"Mr Watson, indeed I have been told that the timing is likely to get us into this sort of situation, such that we cannot vote on the report today."
"And this could cause problems, tomorrow morning, for many more delegations than you just mentioned."
"Indeed I feel this is not a matter for any specific delegation, and I felt I must make that clear."
"Madam President, the Commission wishes to stress the importance of the instrument which we are proposing to Parliament."
"We would like to have political support that is as wide as possible for it."
"From the Commission' s point of view, and as far as the timetable is concerned, in order for the dossier to be examined by the Council on 2 and 3 December, Parliament' s vote must take place today."
"If not, we shall have to renegotiate the entire timetable with the Council, and I cannot tell you what the results of such renegotiations will be."
"Indeed that is probably the most disruptive aspect of work in the Union: one can never predict the outcome of negotiations with the Council."
"Commissioner, would it still be acceptable it we were to vote on the report on 1 December?"
"Madam President, we have now heard the Commissioner as well."
"That confirms to me and to all of us that we must vote today."
"We need Eurodac."
"We have had Tampere, and we have had a clear statement from the Council and have always had the full support of the Commissioner."
"As Parliament, we cannot afford in the public' s eyes, to deliberately cause delays."
"We need the system."
"We should therefore amend the agenda so that the vote can take place today, as otherwise there would be excessive delays."
"I would therefore ask you to take a vote on whether the vote takes place today or whether it is adjourned."
"We need the vote today!"
"Mr Pirker, I feel the best course of action, in fact, is to move on quickly to the report."
"The faster we go, the greater the chances that it will be possible not only to debate but also to vote on the report this morning."
"I am keeping in mind what the Commissioner has said."
"Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, I must come to you. Would you agree to my proposing to the House, if the House indeed accepts, to rearrange the agenda and deal with the Pirker report immediately before your own?"
"Madam President, I agree, although I hope that there will be sufficient time to discuss my report this morning."
"Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, thank you very much indeed."
"This is very generous of you."
"I now turn to the House. Do you agree to debate Mr Pirker' s report immediately before Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s?"
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Internal OLAF investigations"
"The next item is the report (A5-0066/1999) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"Mr President, I would just like to remind you that Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure, already used for the Napolitano report, stipulates that ""except in the cases of urgency referred to in Rules 50 and 112, a debate and vote shall not be opened on a text unless it was distributed at least twenty-four hours previously"" ."
"Now, I would inform you that the last amendments to the Giannakou-Koutsikou report were distributed yesterday evening."
"The last translated amendment, the French version of amendment No 20, was distributed at 9.52 p.m. yesterday evening."
"Therefore, the requisite 24 hours laid down in the Rules of Procedure have not passed, either for the debate or for the vote, so I would like to ask the President whether we are going to enforce an urgency that completely violates the Rules this time as well, because, in that case, we can throw the Rules of Procedure away and decide that we can do everything that is urgent as long as we establish that it is urgent."
"I do not believe that there have even been any proposals tabled on the urgency of this report."
"I would therefore like to know whether this debate and the vote will take place in exactly the same way as the debate on the Napolitano report, in contravention of our Rules of Procedure."
"This is the issue."
"Thank you, Mr Cappato, for invoking the Rules of Procedure, even if we have already discussed the matter and a decision has been made."
"I do not think that we can reopen the debate on whether or not the Rules of Procedure are being complied with."
"Mr President, I hope that the small number of Members who are still present in the Chamber will pay some attention to this report."
"To tell the truth, given that the issue is considered very sensitive by many, I regret the fact that the debate and what I am about to say on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is not being broadcast in any way."
"What I am about to say is quite important. The text, which did not obtain the required qualified majority during October' s part-session in this Chamber, has been amended on the initiative of the largest political group, which at the time expressed reservations and demanded further clarification."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has, in fact, adopted three amendments by Mr Méndez de Vigo, which, for the purposes of the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement within Parliament, give a special role to Parliament' s President herself, to whom all information regarding the Members will be sent."
"In addition, the Committee has adopted an amendment by Mr Nassauer and Mr Brok, that is the new Article 4 of the model decision, and I shall quote the amendment word for word - ""Rules governing Members' parliamentary immunity and the right to refuse to testify shall remain unchanged"" ."
"Thus, we have further strengthened the guarantee, which was already present in several parts of the text, of full compliance with the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities - and, in particular, I want to mention Article 10 of the Protocol, which is very precise and exhaustive - and full compliance with the related Rules, in particular, Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure, which, in implementation of the provisions of article 10 of the Protocol to the Article I have just mentioned, regulates Members' immunities even more closely."
"So allow me to say to those Members who have expressed doubts and concerns that, thanks to these amendments tabled by Members from the European People' s Party, they can vote for this text with peace of mind."
"However, I must immediately recall and reaffirm what the mandate given to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was - President Fontaine reminded us too - and the subject of the decision that Parliament has to take."
"The mandate was, and still is, simply the following - the decision to be taken is this: to include the interinstitutional agreement in the Rules of Procedure, i.e. our internal regulations, so that it can be applied within Parliament, on the basis of an opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control; to amend the Rules of Procedure by introducing a new Rule 9b and not to amend the interinstitutional agreement."
"I would point this out, in particular, to those Members who were not Members of the previous Parliament."
"Personally, I am in the same situation: Parliament gave its President the mandate to sign this interinstitutional agreement on 6 May last year, and it was signed on 25 May."
"I respect the opinion of those Members - newly elected or already Members of Parliament - who have expressed reservations and concerns about this Agreement, but I had to consider those amendments that seek to change the interinstitutional agreement, which we are simply required to implement as it is, to be inadmissible in committee."
"What you perhaps consider worrying, what you will read, is not a Parliamentary decision; it is the model decision that is part of the interinstitutional agreement, already published - with the identical wording - in the Official Journal of 31 May last year."
"We have limited ourselves to introducing technical adjustments to allow proper implementation within Parliament."
"I would like to conclude by pointing out that, if the experience of implementing this interinstitutional agreement suggests that that some of its aspects need to be discussed with the other institutions again, this can easily be done in the future."
"Nevertheless, today, I think that we have the duty not to deny the signature with which we confirmed our commitment to implementing the interinstitutional agreement."
"Mr President, two questions need to be answered with regard to the new proposal in the Napolitano report."
"The first question is: is the proposal in accordance with the rules of the OLAF European Parliament and Council Regulation of 25 May 1999?"
"And the second question is: is the proposal in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission?"
"The answer to the first question is an obvious ""yes"" ."
"The proposal is in accordance with the Regulation."
"The answer to the second question is not so easy."
"It was the intention of the agreement to find a solution to the whistle-blower problem, that is to say, to the question of what an official should do if he obtains knowledge of fraud or clues suggesting corruption but - for whatever reason - does not want to confide in his superiors."
"We have said that he should then approach OLAF directly."
"This possibility is now excluded in the proposal before us in the case of Members of this House."
"That is justified because the Members are protected in a special way by the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities in the performance of their duties."
"This protection goes further than the protection enjoyed by the Members of the EU Commission through this Protocol."
"My concern is only that the proposal that officials should approach the President of the Parliament directly, will create more problems than it solves."
"It is foreseeable that the press will then regularly ask: How many cases are there and which ones?"
"If there are none, they will say that they have intimidated their officials to such an extent that nobody trusts himself or herself any more."
"If there are some, then they will try to drag each of these cases into the spotlight."
"I would have preferred to take up the original proposal by the Committee on Budgetary Control in its opinion for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in which this whole series of questions is ignored and only the rights and obligations of the Members is covered."
"That would have left us time to consider other questions in peace."
"I believe, nevertheless, that given the difficult circumstances, Mr Napolitano has drawn up a very good report and I should like to support him in the vote this lunchtime."
"Mr President, I would like to refer to the closing words of the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Bösch."
"I believe he is right, that this is an issue that was difficult to incorporate into our Rules of Procedure and that, in the end, it has been resolved satisfactorily."
"Of course, there were perhaps other possibilities, but in this Parliament there was, above all, one concern: to fulfil the objectives which we had set."
"That is to say, fight fraud, corruption and any illegal activity which harms our Community."
"But we are a political Assembly and politicians - as we know well - are subject to all kinds of influences."
"We have tried to prevent a healthy, specific political objective from being misinterpreted and misused."
"That discussion which we held in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the means by which any possible illegal activity could be brought to the knowledge of OLAF, I believe has led us to a suitable means, because a political body must have a filter which can examine whether this information is well-founded or not and whether or not it contravenes the immunity and inviolability of Members."
"Therefore, Mr President, I believe that the amendments which we have introduced in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs fulfil the objective of reconciling the decision of the three institutions with the characteristics of our own decision."
"Please allow me to congratulate two people in particular."
"One is the President of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, who is in a way the mother of OLAF and of all these regulations. The other, who I consider to be the father of the current regulation, is Mr Napolitano, who has shown great moderation, intelligence and, above all, courage, in the quest for this difficult solution."
"Mr President, the overwhelming majority of my group is fully in support of this report which we consider to be one of the essential building blocks in restoring the credibility of the European Union in questions of how it investigates and deals with allegations of fraud; if it does nothing else it will perhaps prove that many such allegations are often, but not always alas, unfounded."
"This report applies within Parliament a text that was agreed by the last Parliament, was approved in principle in plenary when we authorised our President to sign it, signed by all the institutions and now applies within each of them except, until today, within Parliament."
"In Parliament it met with unanimous support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs the first time it was discussed and the first time we debated it here, every single one of the major political groups said that it supported the proposal."
"At the last minute there were some difficulties and the matter was reconsidered in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, but I believe that the difficulties and concerns that were raised have been adequately dealt with."
"May I remind you that the provisions which would apply to Members of the Parliament are, to quote the text itself, ""without prejudice to the provisions of the Treaties and in particular the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities""."
"There is a specific reference also in the preamble to the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities and there is a reference to the fact that the relevant article is without prejudice to the confidentiality requirements that may be laid down for Members of the European Parliament."
"Our position as Members of the European Parliament is safeguarded in this respect, and Members who had genuine fears that this would be some sort of snoopers' charter or some sort of a new right given to officials to report confidentially on MEPs with wild allegations can rest assured that this is not the case."
"The reports would go to OLAF, be properly investigated and would protect the position of MEPs."
"If we failed to approve this today, we would be in the untenable situation that only MEPs would be above the law in this respect: a text that applies within the Council to politicians and officials alike, in the Commission to politicians and officials alike, would apply in Parliament only to our officials and not to Members of the European Parliament."
"That would be totally unacceptable and would destroy the credibility of this Parliament."
"It is essential that this report be adopted today."
"Mr President, I have to say that I fully respect the sincerity and the passion of those who find themselves opposed to this report."
"Serious cultural problems have emerged inside this Parliament as we have debated the issues involved."
"My group has considered it very carefully and we conclude that it is a technical putting into effect of the agreement that the Parliament has signed on parliamentary immunity, and privileges will not be removed without due process."
"All the points expressed in the various amendments are already sensibly covered."
"Parliament's assent to this agreement is already five months late, and the public simply would not appreciate a further refusal to make progress and to create a strict but fair regime for the Parliament as for the other bodies."
"Mr President, if we decide on this Rule of Procedure then it will be easier to combat fraud and to include the Parliament."
"That would be good, as we have fought for it."
"However, what we have not fought for and are most resolutely against and where we see the position of Parliament and of the independent mandate jeopardised to a great extent, is if investigations can be initiated against freely elected Members of Parliament, not only on suspicion but on mere supposition if a system of compulsory informing is set up here, if not for fraud and corruption but for overall authorisation, and I quote, ""to intervene in serious incidents in the performance of one' s duty""."
"Just imagine, that investigations against Members of Parliament for serious incidents in the performance of their duties - a completely fabricated undefined legal concept that contradicts the constitutional tradition of each of the fifteen Member States - could be introduced, that investigations could be initiated if Members of Parliament contravene duties comparable with the disciplinary law for career public servants, a disciplinary law we do not have and comparable duties that do not exist!"
"That is an overall authorisation of an authority that not only exposes the Members of Parliament to all kinds of informing but which opens a system of informing and political agitation that makes a mockery of an independent mandate and a free Parliament."
"That has nothing to do with combating fraud."
"The Council has attacked the position of the Parliament at its core and damaged it!"
"Mr President, up to now there has been a succession of procedural errors which I hope will not work to the detriment of the Parliament in possible court cases."
"I should like to say to Mr Corbett that a Member of the European Parliament has never been above the law, even if these Rules of Procedure are not changed."
"We are always subject to the law and also to criminal law."
"That must be stressed quite clearly, independently of our internal Rules here."
"What we are dealing with here is the method by which the controls, checks and investigations are carried out."
"I am of the opinion that we must ensure that the freedom of the individual Members of Parliament, including those who belong to a minority, must be protected from political pressure from outside and from within, so that they are not overrun with proceedings so that they are in the end so involved that they cannot deal with the situation any more."
"That is the classic principle of the independence of the mandate that has been fought for over many centuries, particularly as protection from the executive."
"Only in this way is the Member of Parliament able to exercise control."
"He must have the right to refuse to bear witness, without any 'ifs' or 'buts' ."
"This already applies to us but the ways in which it applies partially negate it."
"A Member of Parliament can then only if he has this right to refuse to bear witness, keep information to himself and only then will people come to him and tell him something if they know that he must not inform on them."
"Only then can we exercise control within the meaning of Parliament vis--vis the executive and we should not ruin this by linking everything - whether officials, the executive or the Members of Parliament in one and the same Article."
"If this is adopted here today and the anger dies down, we would perhaps then again have the strength to check whether with a proper goal the inclusion of the Members of Parliament in control mechanisms can protect this independent mandate and perhaps lead to some other phrasing."
"This is not possible just now in the heat of the moment and I would ask my colleagues to remember this if it comes up again."
"Mr President, I just wish to observe for the record that, in addition to the consequences of this scandalous interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, I have also lost my speaking time."
"I had entered my name, I had a lot of things to say, but as a result of this outrageous rigging, I no longer have the right to speak."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 p.m."
"Eurodac"
"The next item is the report (A5-0059/1999) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and certain other aliens (COM(1999) 260 - C5­0082/1999 - 1999/0116(CNS))."
"Mr President, I am speaking here not only as the rapporteur but also in my capacity as the spokesman of the European People' s Party, but first of all as the rapporteur."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I earlier appealed to you all to discuss Eurodac and to vote on it today, because Eurodac is a system that finally enables us to implement the Dublin Convention."
"In this Dublin Convention, that was concluded in 1990, the responsibility is established of a Member State' s competence to deal with an asylum procedure - according to this agreement, the State responsible is the one in which a refugee first finds safe haven."
"Up to now control has not been possible because it has not been possible clearly to define a person' s identity."
"In Eurodac, almost ten years later, we have an instrument that makes possible the clear identification of asylum-seekers and also of illegal immigrants."
"What is its purpose?"
"The aim of Eurodac is to help implement what was agreed in Dublin."
"The aim of Eurodac is to establish once and for all which Member State is responsible for the asylum procedure."
"The aim of Eurodac is to prevent multiple applications and thereby also to stop social abuse and indirectly it has the effect of sharing the burden."
"And that too is something quite essential."
"Therefore under Eurodac, every Member State is bound to take the fingerprints of all asylum-seekers, all illegal immigrants who are picked up at the border in order to compare whether an application for asylum has already been submitted anywhere else."
"The Member States also have the opportunity of fingerprinting illegal immigrants who are found in the Member State itself for the purpose of comparison."
"In the discussion, that was very long, very good and very pragmatic, a solution was also reached."
"On the vote in the Committee on the Eurodac system there was full agreement, only the Group of the Greens was against the system as a whole and introduced proposals for amendment that were such as to completely destroy the Eurodac system."
"They were rejected."
"There was also full agreement with the Social Democrats on the system, which we were pleased about."
"There were proposals for amendment, which aimed to raise the age from 14 to 18 and early cancellation was planned if refugee status was attained."
"There was a majority here, which was against my opinion as the rapporteur."
"The report as a whole was deemed positive and was adopted in plenary session."
"That is, in the view of the Committee, with the full support of the Social Democrats as well, in Eurodac we have an instrument for an orderly asylum procedure in Europe and for combating abuse."
"That is all I wish to say with regard to my function as rapporteur."
"Now, I will speak in my capacity as the EPP spokesman as well."
"I am against political groupings always trying to present Eurodac as a system that does not help this monitoring, but is a form of criminalisation because fingerprints are taken."
"It is not a matter of criminalising somebody, but giving the Member States the responsibility, giving them the duty of dealing with the asylum procedure and also of protecting young people when fingerprints are taken from the age of 14."
"Because only if we know that they are this age do they of course fall under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or under the Hague Convention and under the protective measures of the Member States."
"It therefore has a protective function if we also take the fingerprints of young people and this is in full accord with all the Conventions that we possess."
"The Greens are against the system and I think that they are simply refusing to face up to reality!"
"They will bear the full responsibility if this system and a proper asylum policy for Europe fail."
"Let me just say something else, that I consider to be especially important."
"I have received from Minister Schily - he is the Minister of the Interior in Germany and a Social Democrat - an urgent plea and an appeal for this Eurodac system to become a reality, with which he went against his own Social Democrats here in the House and against all the others who are attempting not to accept this system."
"It is remarkable when one is asked as a Christian Democrat to undertake something here against the Left in this House."
"We need the Eurodac system."
"I am most fervently in favour of it because it takes us towards achieving a common asylum policy for Europe and the Member States are at their wits end over this problem."
"We also have here a system against asylum abuse, against illegal immigration."
"If the Social Democrats and the Greens vote against Eurodac, then they will bear full responsibility if there is further asylum abuse and illegal immigration."
"Mr President, there are days when it seems easy to do one' s job and other days when it is difficult to do one' s job."
"For me, today is one of the latter, a day on which we have difficult problems to resolve."
"These problems are of two kinds."
"There is a political problem to settle and that is the matter of how are we going to proceed with the fingerprinting system for asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants or those staying illegally, as they are described by the Council and the European Union authorities, and how are we going to proceed with the controversial arguments of our colleague Mr Pirker?"
"I shall begin with the latter, because it is logically more fun to discuss politics in Parliament than on paper."
"If anyone should take the blame here for the fact that we are finding it so hard to find common ground, then it is the rapporteur."
"You, Mr Pirker, with your proposals for amendments, have from the beginning endeavoured to aggravate the work that the Council has submitted to us, which is already highly controversial."
"We cannot hold that against you, it is your political right, but you must be aware that the Left in this House cannot support the restrictive measures, that as a conservative Austrian, you wish to pursue!"
"(Applause from left)"
"The second point that I should like to make here is that when you express regret about the poor Social Democrats and the contradictions between them and the German government, the whole story should be told."
"Mr Schily wrote you a letter that he also sent to Mr Nassauer and myself."
"In his letter, Mr Schily referred to the difficulties that we as Social Democrats have picked as a central theme in this consultation procedure and gave his opinion from his point of view as the German Minister of the Interior."
"This letter arrived in the last few days and it gave rise to a lively debate in the Social Democratic Group that led to us asking you to give us a little more time so that we can finish discussing this controversial subject, in order then to attempt to work with you by consensus."
"I discussed this with you yesterday evening at 10 p.m., but we know your position and what you will say: We have the majority here, we will get it through and anyone who is not with us is actually refusing to face up to reality - as you put it so well yourself!"
"This is not the way to create a reasonable asylum policy in the European Union!"
"It must be built on a broad consensus and not on exclusion and confrontation, as you seem to wish."
"What is our problem?"
"The Council has said, and there is some understanding in our Group for this, that we need to extend the registration system for asylum-seekers to other target groups and you have used perfectly good arguments that we also appreciate."
"For example, the system should afford protection to minors, who are smuggled in illegally and who are here forced into prostitution, amongst other things. This kind of fingerprinting system can be seen as giving them a certain police and state protection."
"Our problem is a constitutional one."
"Should we not separate those people who, as political victims of persecution claim a basic right to which they are entitled, i.e. protection from this persecution, from those who have, for example, entered a country illegally or who have smuggled people in, or from those who have been smuggled in against their will?"
"Should we not separate this group of people?"
"Because we believe that this discussion is not yet at an end and because we also wish to discuss the subject again with Minister Schily, we have asked you to wait a fortnight."
"What if you now say, a year has gone by, for goodness sake, and we cannot wait another fortnight, Mr Pirker!"
"(Applause from left)"
"So I must say to you that the method you are using is intensifying the debate in this House."
"That is not a good thing!"
"I will say to you now - trusting in the liberality of the Liberal Group -, that with this strategy you will fail in the long term!"
"For today you have again been lucky, but in the long term this exclusion method will not be successful."
"We are not against Eurodac, in principle, but we would have liked more time for consultation."
"You did not want to give it to us."
"You alone are responsible for this impasse!"
"Liberals in this House have a number of concerns about the draft protocol that was put forward in this draft regulation."
"It carries a risk that it may blur the distinction between asylum-seekers and other types of immigrants."
"It carries the risk that it may diminish the protection of those who need it by mistakenly channelling them through normal immigration procedures rather than asylum procedures."
"There are certain ""legal grey areas"" ."
"The extension of EURODAC to persons who are not seeking asylum is, conceivably, outside the competence of the Dublin Convention, for example."
"There is the risk that this protocol, this regulation, may be unworkable."
"Member States will have little incentive to fingerprint third country nationals whom they find illegally on their territory, if there is a risk that they may become responsible for them."
"Finally, there is a certain lack of clarity in some of the definitions used, like 'irregular crossing', 'illegally present' and so on."
"Nonetheless, we believe that the debates in this House, in our committee, have been such that we have a good report drawn up here with the support of most political groups and I congratulate the rapporteur on it. The Liberal Democrats will support this report."
"We will not support amendments 13 to 20: although we share concerns about finger-printing, we believe that the attempt to stop a register being created will fail to deal in realistic terms with the challenges that we face."
"Let me say one thing to Mr Schulz who raised the question of liberality."
"This is a time for cool heads and good argument."
"Mr Schulz cannot deny that we face a challenge in the Union with the number of people illegally present."
"We have to find a way of tackling that problem while at the same time protecting civil liberties."
"We believe that this report achieves that, and that is why we will be happy to give it our support."
"Mr Prodi, Mr President, with regard to Eurodac and the viewpoint of the Greens and the European Free Alliance, I must say that I welcome the subtle distinctions made by the previous speakers after rapporteur Pirker' s introduction."
"There are quite a few reservations and observations with regard to this report, including its lack of a social and human dimension."
"Many police staff and criminal investigation services will of course welcome this report with open arms as it simplifies their work."
"We need to be realistic and we do not deny that there is abuse."
"Neither would I wish to see the Greens held responsible for the organised crime in this world, as people will shortly be saying we are responsible because we are unwilling to do anything about it."
"This is untrue."
"A house is built on solid foundations."
"This report hardly constitutes a foundation, in fact, it is even a little reprehensible, in my opinion, although the amendments submitted make it more acceptable and tone it down somewhat."
"However, we should not lose sight of the fact that asylum seekers look for safety, need a roof over their head and money to buy food."
"The proposal' s point of departure is that asylum seekers are actually suspects."
"It is assumed that they abuse the right of asylum."
"And this is not proper."
"Asylum seekers are criminalised here but they are not criminals."
"Applicants are having a criminal role forced upon them, but are, in actual fact, victims, victims of the situation in their country of origin."
"Turning now to minimum standards: a control policy as proposed is only acceptable if minimum standards apply across all states with regard to the handling of asylum applications."
"Applications should be dealt with correctly and uniformly wherever they are submitted."
"The gap is still too wide at the moment."
"Needless to say, someone will apply for asylum where he hopes he will find recognition, a listening ear and humane treatment."
"Finally, I would like to touch upon protective measures for personal data. These measures do not apply to refugees at the moment."
"This discrimination also promotes criminalisation."
"Within our Green group, a discussion has been opened on the principle of fingerprinting in general."
"When investigations are undertaken into organised crime, it is necessary to be completely clear on people' s identity in order to track down the criminals and for the benefit of the victims."
"Every effort must be made to stop organised crime in its tracks."
"Fingerprinting can help us achieve this."
"Asylum seekers look for safety and a sense of security and do not wish their name to be on display across Europe."
"Maybe in future, a debate could take place on the role of fingerprinting."
"Mr President, in our Group we view Eurodac as a drastic departure from the Dublin Convention."
"It is now being proposed that illegal immigrants as young as 14 years of age should also be covered by the arrangements in question, while the Dublin Convention is concerned only with asylum-seekers."
"In our view, Eurodac is not a prerequisite for enabling the Dublin Convention to function."
"It just gives the authorities increased opportunities for exercising control and, in any state based on the rule of law, very serious attention must necessarily be given to the balance between control measures and the rights of the individual."
"This is absolutely crucial."
"So let it be stated immediately that our Group is opposed to Eurodac."
"We hope that Parliament will again dig in its heels over this frontal assault on the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as on the legal rights of third-country nationals within the borders of the European Union."
"Taking fingerprints from people, just because they are not citizens of a Member State, is tantamount to wholesale criminalisation of foreign nationals."
"To mix immigrants and asylum-seekers together in a fingerprint register is a departure from the basic idea of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"Asylum-seekers are entitled to ask for protection."
"It is not a criminal offence to request asylum."
"And the Dublin Convention in fact relates only to the first country of refuge."
"If a fingerprint register is to be established, we do not under any circumstances want asylum-seekers to be mixed together with either legal or illegal immigrants, and we want to propose that, under such a system, fingerprints are taken only from people who have been sentenced for having committed criminal acts."
"It is proposed that 14 year-olds should have their fingerprints taken and stored in a register."
"We think that this is a departure from the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which requires that we protect children and which recommends 18 years as the age at which, generally, a child is deemed to become an adult."
"If a register is to be established, we want it to be possible to take fingerprints only from people of 18 years of age and over."
"Fingerprints are something which you take from criminals, and even criminals are entitled to protection."
"The rules on the erasure of records and the disclosure of information are far too vague in the Council' s proposal."
"If a register is to be established, we propose that it should be possible for a person' s records to be erased as soon as that person has received a residence permit from a Member State."
"Let me repeat this once more: we are opposed to Eurodac."
"We consider this proposal to be a huge boulder in the wall around Fortress Europe, a wall we want to see broken down."
"I can essentially go along with what Pernille Frahm has just said, and we shall also support her amendment which, in spite of everything, does nonetheless mitigate this dreadful piece of legislation we are debating, albeit to no great legal effect, because this is a simple consultation procedure."
"I have two points to make."
"First of all, I have some questions for the Commissioner."
"It is, of course, evident from Protocol No 5 to the Amsterdam Treaty on the position of Denmark, that Title IV of the Treaty does not apply to Denmark, but this is not apparent from the proposed regulation."
"I should like to see this matter clarified and would ask that the clarification be included in the proposal. Next, I should like to ask the Commissioner if this is to be viewed in connection with what is dealt with in Article 5 of the Protocol I mentioned, namely a decision to build upon the Schengen acquis."
"If so, there is a definite procedure for how Denmark is to be incorporated into the system."
"Is it this rule which is to be followed, or others?"
"And finally: if it is this rule or other rules which are to be followed, what would be the consequences of a Danish accession?"
"Is it the case that decisions by the EU authorities, including the European Court of Justice, are binding upon Denmark?"
"The second point is the fundamental and most important one."
"As Pernille Frahm rightly said, this proposal concerns an extension to Fortress Europe."
"It is an effective defence mechanism, and what is being put in place is a complete and consistent absence of legal rights for one large group of people, namely asylum seekers, and for a group of other foreigners without, moreover, there being the right to differentiate between them."
"There are no elementary rules concerning legal rights in connection with the registration procedure and in connection with the right to pass on this information held by the Member States and the Commission."
"I want to say that this is the most repressive system we have experienced in Europe in this century, at any rate in the perspective of the Nordic legal tradition, and we have had our share of repressive systems."
"And what is interesting and sinister is that it is wrapped up in phraseology which would have made the late propaganda Minister, Joseph Goebbels, turn green with envy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that this total absence of legal rights is to be established by virtue of conditions in the Treaty which concern and proclaim an Area of Freedom, Security and Justice and which guarantee freedom of movement."
"What, in fact, we are dealing with here is the very opposite and, to crown it all, Mr Pirker' s report also attaches importance - and this is the only real amendment proposed - to replacing the concept of a foreigner with that of a citizen of a third country."
"Is the reason for this that the concept of a foreigner has negative connotations?"
"What the realities of the situation are is not so important. What is important is the packaging."
"You are welcome to it, is what I say."
"Mr President, in my own small country alone, we will have between 35,000 and 40,000 alleged asylum seekers this year, in addition to tens of thousands of asylum seekers of the past few of years who are still waiting for their cases to be resolved, and on top of this, there are an estimated 150,000 illegal immigrants, which means that the problem which we are focusing on today can hardly be overestimated."
"We therefore give our full support to the Eurodac database for fingerprinting being set up."
"We will gladly approve the Pirker report and I would ask the rapporteur to consider the criticism that follows as minor criticism of an otherwise sound report which represents a good step in the right direction."
"After all, it must be clear that the Eurodac database should not just serve the purpose of establishing which Member State might deal with a particular asylum seeker' s case, but rather it should make it more difficult or impossible to abuse the asylum system in the future."
"I therefore regret that Parliament has further mitigated the already weakened and moderate Council proposals in its various amendments."
"It is completely beyond me why both the Council and Parliament are still a great deal laxer on illegal immigrants than on alleged asylum seekers."
"After all, the fingerprints of illegal immigrants may not be kept ten but two years, may not be compared with each other - one wonders why - and may only be used for comparison with new asylum applications within the two-year period."
"I fear that this illustrates that, according to some, the Eurodac system should serve, perhaps not exclusively but largely, at any rate, to assign a particular Member State the responsibility of footing the bill for a certain level of illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system, rather than to render such abuses completely impossible."
"Finally, I would put a big question mark over the fact that it appears that some sort of office of the European Commission will manage the system."
"In my opinion, it should be assigned to a European police body such as Europol."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you to take note of the fact that in this building there are meeting rooms with no screen."
"And while there are plenary sittings and meetings under way at the same time, it would be a good thing if all the rooms had screens, if that is not too much trouble."
"Mr President, our Group has significant doubts, and reasonable doubts, in relation to the EURODAC report presented."
"We have already rejected a report which intended, in unclear terms, and for who knows what reason, to take the fingerprints of the illegal immigrants who arrive in the European Union."
"We have a new proposal, this time from the Commission, which makes important advances."
"This new proposal says that the fingerprints of illegal immigrants - because we are talking about the extension of the existing EURODAC programme to illegal immigrants - will only be taken in application of the Dublin Asylum Convention, that is to say, only in order to find out whether these immigrants have asked for asylum in another Member State of the European Union."
"We are not opposed to this idea, on the contrary, we are not against clarifying whether there is a Member State responsible for the handling of the case if it is shown that a person has already applied for asylum."
"But we have many doubts about this massive taking of fingerprints - because we believe it will be massive - of people who have crossed borders illegally or who are in an illegal situation in a Member State."
"Therefore, we believe that a little more time is needed to carry out the proposed extension of the EURODAC system."
"What we are clear about is that it is not acceptable to apply it to minors."
"In this respect we will stand firm."
"We will demand that this system be applied only to adults, because minors require other legal provisions if they are not accompanied."
"And if they are with their family, that family will enter the system."
"Thank you, Mrs Terrón i Cusí."
"We take note of your request."
"There is no doubt that an intelligent building must show intelligence throughout."
"Mr President, the whole principle of fingerprinting asylum-seekers, as far as I am concerned, is intolerable."
"It is basically criminalising victims, people who are seeking asylum and refuge."
"Instead, our priority should be to improve the situation of asylum-seekers in the Member States."
"In my own country at the moment the situation for asylum-seekers is completely intolerable."
"Just this week the Minister for Justice has announced that he is going to prosecute taxi drivers who carry illegal immigrants."
"Basically what we are doing is promoting the whole attitude of xenophobia and victimising people who are already victims."
"The report tries to make the protocol sound less threatening, but the principle is exactly the same."
"We are criminalising victims."
"Fingerprinting is something that is normally done to suspected criminals. Suspected criminals at least have the advantage that they will have legal representation, they will know their rights."
"These people will not know their rights, not have legal representation."
"The protocol does not explain where and how fingerprinting will be done."
"Will it be on entry into the country, before the border is crossed?"
"If this is the case does that mean that anyone, anywhere, can be stopped?"
"This is basically in line with the Dublin Convention."
"It was something set up in secret, behind closed doors, unfortunately in my own country - which I am very sorry about."
"It basically promotes the whole idea of a fortress Europe, keeping out the so-called undesirables, whereas we should be looking at why people are seeking asylum, not victimising them."
"One of the improvements aimed at here is on age."
"The idea is that fingerprinting 14-year-old children is completely unacceptable."
"But even at the age of 18 or 21 it is still unacceptable because these people are not criminals."
"You are making the assumption they are."
"The whole principle of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty seems to have been done away with here."
"The attitude within the European Union towards asylum-seekers has to change."
"What we are doing is encouraging the xenophobia that is growing throughout the Member States of the European Union."
"That is a tragedy."
"Mr President, the Eurodac project shows the true face of liberal Europe."
"A fortress of suspicion and police repression aligned against the persecuted people of this earth."
"The computer database of fingerprints is an infringement of individual freedom."
"It systematically treats asylum seekers as suspects."
"It calls into question the inviolability of the documents held by the bodies responsible for handling asylum requests."
"It contravenes the legal protection to which refugees are entitled."
"Applying even to children as young as 14, it contravenes the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically article 10 thereof."
"Who here would dare take the fingerprints of a fourteen year-old kid?"
"The Eurodac project makes criminals of the immigrants who find themselves without proper papers, without status, often because of the diversity of laws between countries."
"Basically, it contravenes all international conventions for the protection of human rights."
"With this, fortress Europe is committing the crime of failing to assist refugees in danger."
"Is this so surprising for a liberal Europe which arms the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters, while at the same time rejecting Kurdish refugees?"
"Eurodac must of necessity be rejected."
"Mr President, the report provides me with the opportunity to comment in this House on the unjustified rebukes against us non-attached Members case by case."
"The assertion that we are adopting a restrictive position on asylum, of which the rapporteur was also accused today is simply wrong."
"Our position is quite clear."
"Although it is not necessary to mention it, I should nevertheless like to say to all those who agree with the criticism without knowing the position, that of course our policy is based on the Geneva Convention relating to Refugees."
"Of course we consider it absolutely necessary to provide temporary protection for displaced persons."
"Anyone who needs protection should be protected."
"What we do say, however, is that the unsuitable migration policy has led to social problems in conurbations, which we as serious politicians should not ignore."
"This criticism must be permitted in a democratic structure."
"Because we consider that a fair sharing of the burden is an important aspect of asylum policy, we are also in favour of introducing all relevant measures just as for the Dublin Convention and Eurodac."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of the report."
"The rapporteur in his introduction said that the objective is to implement the Dublin Convention and have a system of fingerprinting."
"My group agrees in principle with that, but we want some safeguards."
"Mr Pirker also said that the purpose was to ensure that there are no social abuses of the system."
"Again, my group would agree with that, but we want to make certain of this, which is why safeguards are necessary to ensure that there are no abuses by the authorities either."
"I believe that there are some on the right of this House who wish to muddy the waters and to draw no distinction between asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, third country nationals."
"I shy away from the use of the word 'foreigners', or indeed the word that was used in the translation of the English text."
"In English 'aliens' are people from another planet and to be perfectly honest we do not have much of a problem with that at the moment."
"There seem to be, though, Members of this House who have no sympathy with either group - and if there were aliens from another planet, they would probably have little sympathy with them either."
"The safeguards and the amendments that we are asking for are designed to ensure that any data collected is processed properly and that where people are granted asylum or achieve legitimate status the data collected is deleted."
"On the age limit, it is sometimes very difficult to tell the age of a young person, but there seems to be a consensus that 18 is a fair compromise."
"Mrs McKenna in her impassioned speech a few moments ago said that we must ensure that asylum seekers and others are not treated as criminals."
"Certainly we want to ensure that this new system is used to assist the most vulnerable in our society."
"I accept, as I am sure we all must do, that people do not leave their homes and families and travel half-way across Europe thousands of miles away for no reason at all."
"They do not do just it on a whim, they do it for a real reason and we must accept and respect the fact that they need support and they need help and assistance."
"I hope - and I am sure the Commissioner is listening - we can make certain that when this system comes into full operation, it is used positively, humanely and with considerable compassion to help and support the most vulnerable in our society."
"First of all, I would like to say to the honourable Members that in the view of the Commission, the EURODAC Regulation is instrumental to the implementation of the Dublin Convention which determines which Member State is responsible for considering an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States."
"The Tampere European Council has called for work on EURODAC to be concluded rapidly, and the Commission considers in fact that EURODAC is an important instrument."
"If governments and citizens can be confident that we have effective arrangements in place to decide which state is responsible for considering an asylum claim and to tackle the problem of multiple asylum applications, it will make easier our task of promoting high and fair standards of asylum."
"Once the EURODAC Regulation has been adopted, it will be incumbent upon the Council to make similar progress in respect of other asylum instruments."
"I, myself, will shortly unveil a proposal for a legal basis for the European Fund for Refugees."
"This will provide financial assistance from the Community budget for the reception, the integration and the voluntary return of refugees, displaced persons and asylum-seekers which is a relevant instrument to give a human dimension to the asylum policy of the Union, as one Member of the House requested just a few moments ago."
"I shall also be unveiling a proposal for an instrument on asylum procedures after we have received the opinion of Parliament on our working document towards common standards on asylum procedures."
"I shall also unveil a new proposal on temporary protection which will draw on our experiences during the Kosovo crisis."
"Progress on the EURODAC Regulation must be accompanied by real progress in other areas so that we can gradually attain our goal of creating a common European asylum system."
"A proposal which provides for the systematic fingerprinting of asylum seekers and certain other categories of third country nationals clearly raises sensitive and difficult issues."
"We therefore need to ensure the highest standards of fairness and transparency for all those affected by the regulation."
"In particular the most rigorous of data protection standards are required."
"When we converted the EURODAC Convention and Protocol into a Community Regulation, we amended it to bring it fully into line with Community law on data protection including the new Treaty Article 286 on data protection arrangements for the Community Institutions."
"It is up to the authority provided for in Article 286 to ensure the appropriate and adequate use of these data and the application of Community rules."
"We also introduced new provisions on monitoring and evaluation under which the Commission will report regularly to the Parliament and to the Council on the concrete functioning of EURODAC."
"I am grateful to the Committee on Citizens' Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and to their rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report on the EURODAC Regulation."
"The report contains a number of useful amendments which I believe will help us to improve the text of the Regulation."
"The Commission can accept amendment No 1 to avoid the term 'alien' and instead refer to third country nationals, although we will have to make it clear that the Regulation also covers stateless persons."
"We can also accept amendment No 2 to the title which introduces a reference to the Dublin Convention."
"We can also accept the principle of amendment No 6 which makes it clear that there is only a match if fingerprints are identical and not if they are just similar, and we accept also the principle of amendment No 12 which is intended to make it clear that data must never be sent to an asylum applicant's country of origin or used within a Member State for an unrelated purpose."
"I take this opportunity to assure Mrs Terrón i Cusí that illegal immigrants' fingerprints are only used for the specific purpose of the Dublin Convention - which means for analysis - if they have requested a demand for asylum in another Member State."
"The two issues which have been of most concern to the Parliament are the minimum age-limit for fingerprinting and the rules on erasure of data from the central database."
"On the minimum age-limit my approach is to stick to the compromise minimum age-limit of 14 years which was agreed in previous negotiations, but to accept your amendment which makes it clear that fingerprinting must be carried out in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"Migratory movements of people seeking protection unfortunately involve minors."
"We need to ensure that our arrangements for determining responsibility for asylum applications take account of this reality."
"In addition, the age-limit of 14 years was a compromise reached after difficult negotiations."
"I do not want to reopen the discussion and risk ending up with an even less acceptable solution."
"As far as the rules on erasure of data are concerned, the amendments approved by the Committee on Citizens' Rights provide for the erasure of data as soon as anyone covered by the regulation has obtained legal status."
"I can accept this in relation to people who are apprehended irregularly crossing the external border of the European Union and who are fingerprinted under Article 8 of the regulation."
"Indeed, the intention behind the current text is that this data should be erased as soon as the person concerned obtains any kind of residence permit."
"This would include someone who has been admitted as a refugee or under a subsidiary form of protection."
"I cannot go that far in relation to data on asylum applicants, but I can accept some of the amendments that have been put forward."
"If we were to erase all data on asylum applicants as soon as they were granted any kind of legal status, EURODAC would no longer cover situations where an asylum applicant is granted permission to remain in some other capacity for a short time and, at the end of this period, moves to another Member State and claims asylum there."
"But I can accept the amendment which provides that data on asylum applicants should be erased when the person concerned is recognised as a refugee."
"Some Member States consider that a problem arises if people who have been recognised as a refugee in one Member State travel to another Member State and claim asylum there."
"They have therefore argued that data on recognised refugees should be blocked in the central unit so that statistical data can be compiled to measure the scale of the phenomenon."
"I believe that we should take a different approach."
"If people who have been recognised as refugees in one Member State seek asylum in another Member State this is likely to be because refugees do not enjoy the right to reside in a Member State other than the one in which they were recognised as such."
"We should seek to remedy this by including refugees within the scope of an instrument defining the circumstances in which a third country national who is legally resident in one Member State may reside in another Member State."
"I therefore agree that we should now provide that data on recognised refugees should be erased from EURODAC."
"Finally, the regulation will not apply to Denmark."
"This results directly from Denmark's protocol to the Treaty."
"The Commission does not consider that EURODAC is a measure to build on the Schengen acquis under Article B of the Danish protocol."
"We understand that Denmark nevertheless may wish to participate in EURODAC, but it remains to be seen what legal formula could be adopted in that case."
"The amendments which I propose to accept will strengthen the text of the regulation and I am very grateful to Parliament for the important contribution it has made."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"EU action plan to combat drugs"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0063/1999) by Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Internal Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions concerning a European Union action plan to combat drugs (2000-2004) [COM(1999) 239 - C5-0093/1999 - 1999/2095(COS)]"
"Mr President, this debate follows the communication to Parliament of the European Commission' s action programme to combat drugs between 2000 and 2004."
"This programme is not of course a magic recipe which will solve the drugs problem."
"However, the debate here today may help to raise Parliament' s awareness of the massive threat which drugs represent, on the basis of real rather than imaginary data, and help bring about both short- and long-term improvements to the current critical state of affairs."
"Let me say straight away, Mr President, that we approve and endorse the Commission' s programme; however we have formulated a number of reservations, the same reservations formulated by the Commission itself, as regards the inadequate evaluation of programmes and more general shortcomings in relation to the threat which actually exists."
"Over the last fifteen years, Mr President, drugs have not just been a vague threat: the number of synthetic drugs has increased, as has the quantity of cocaine imported into Europe, while heroin is still the main problem."
"They have become a deliberate threat derived from the relationship between organised crime and drug trafficking, the trade in arms and nuclear materials and the emergence of new criminal organisations from Central and Eastern Europe."
"Unfortunately, communications and the information society help the drugs trade."
"Clearly, there is no unequivocal solution to this tremendous problem."
"What is important is that we understand that, if we are to aim for long-term prevention, we must implement policies to abolish the drugs trade and provide treatment for and rehabilitation of drug addicts, so that we can help make prevention a success or at least stabilise the situation."
"The proposal of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is therefore quite clear."
"We consider that greater political will is needed, Mr President, and greater political will mean that we declare war on drugs and drug traffickers without compromise."
"Secondly, we have noted that there is a lack of fundamental coordination. The Portuguese presidency therefore needs to take the initiative and create an inter-pillar council which will meet on a yearly basis in order to coordinate all the action taken within the Union and establish a climate of international coordination."
"There must be full and correct application of the resolutions of the United Nations Organisation and the Special Session and, Mr President, Commissioner, a special anti-drugs clause which commands the same respect as and is on a par with the human rights clause should be included in all agreements with third countries."
"Without greater political will, without this type of initiative and without a more general policy at European and worldwide level, there will be no results."
"The increase in the drug problem cannot be blamed solely on present economic and social circumstances, poor standards set by parents or television."
"It is a far more complex, far more widespread problem."
"Any unequivocal solution or any solution of an administrative nature which fails to take account of the full extent of the real public health problem and the medical aspects of the matter would therefore be a serious mistake."
"Organised crime, Mr President, Commissioner, is running at a faster pace than its prosecutors nowadays."
"It is precisely, therefore, at the political level that we must step up our action."
"The policy on drugs must be mainstreamed."
"It is not only a policy matter for the Ministers of Health."
"It is not only a policy matter for the Ministers of Justice."
"It is a major political problem which basically accounts for or is linked to 80% of international crime, while 50% of transactions throughout Europe relate solely to the trade in and movement of drugs."
"If the Summit, which we feel should deal directly with this matter, fails to understand that this is a most serious political issue, which stretches far into the future and that our inability to deal with it multilaterally, as we should, has started to become more and more apparent, creating disappointment among our citizens, then we shall be unable to stabilise the situation in due course."
"Because drugs, Mr President, will be with us for a long time to come."
"What is important is that we improve the indicators, improve the public health aspects and give a larger number of citizens the chance to realise the extent of the threat and stand up to it."
"Mr President, the plan of action on drug control has been discussed within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I would like to establish here once more that the plan of action met with a great deal of appreciation in our Committee."
"The prevention of drug abuse is necessary and it is essential to bring down the demand for drugs."
"Many within the Committee on Industry are also of the opinion that the fight against addiction cannot be undertaken without respect for the drug user but the Committee on Industry deemed it not to be its task to go into this aspect in any depth."
"Hence, the opinion focuses on the Committee on Industry' s key topics, namely trade and research."
"As far as external trade is concerned, the Committee on Industry is aware that the trade policy can only do so much in the fight against drugs."
"Driving back poverty in the producing countries is an important part of the fight against drugs."
"Trade instruments should therefore be deployed, in addition to other aid programmes."
"The Committee on Industry is also aware, of course, that the drugs topic within the Union and within this Parliament is a controversial one."
"There is not really a European approach."
"There are different approaches of Member States and there is a multilateral strategy within the UN context."
"It is because of this controversy that the Committee on Industry is of the opinion that headway can be made by means of independent research."
"Research can indicate which strategy and programmes proved successful and which did not."
"Based on these facts, maybe we can bridge our differences."
"One of the points of difference concerns the approach adopted at UN level."
"This approach is viewed by many as too repressive."
"Others, on the other hand, are of the opinion that this fight cannot be fought hard enough."
"The fight against drugs equals war."
"The Committee on Industry concludes that the general principles of the UN approach are undisputed, but all the more so the policy."
"This is why the Committee on Industry is urging a thorough evaluation of the multilateral policy and the treaties based thereon."
"It is regrettable that this conclusion is not included is Mrs Giannakou' s report."
"Finally, the Committee on Industry would like to express its appreciation to the Lisbon Observatory."
"Thanks to the findings of the observatory, we may well be able to look beyond our national preferences."
"The Committee on Industry hopes that the Observatory can remain a base for further development of a European approach to the drugs problem."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Corbey."
"The Commissioner has requested the floor now because he cannot attend the debate."
"Therefore, Commissioner, you have the floor."
"The Commission will of course be present during the debate this afternoon, but I will not be there personally."
"Despite considerable efforts to prevent drug abuse and addiction the drug problem continues to pose threats and challenges on the eve of the year 2000."
"The most serious health problems are caused by the use of opiates and, in particular, heroin, amphetamines and multi-drug use."
"Cannabis is still the most commonly used illicit drug in the Union."
"Infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C have reached high prevalence amongst intravenous drug users."
"Organised crime plays an increasingly dominant role in drug production and trafficking."
"We have to respond to these challenges."
"I should also extend my sincerest gratitude to Parliament, particularly to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, for the quality of their work and the speed with which they have commended the Commission's communication on combating drugs for the period 2000 to 2004."
"This will allow the Helsinki European Council to adopt an efficient strategy against this disturbing phenomenon."
"The main general targets for the European Union's strategy against drugs for the next five years can be summarised as follows: to reduce significantly the prevalence of illicit drug use among young people under 18 years of age; to reduce substantially the number of drug-related deaths; to increase considerably the number of successfully treated addicts and to reduce substantially the number of serious drug-related crimes, including money laundering and illicit traffic in precursors."
"In the field of demand reduction, preventive measures and programmes for children and young people should, instead of focusing exclusively on illegal drugs, address addiction in general, including aspects of alcohol and tobacco use."
"Training of professionals from social, health, education and law enforcement sectors is a prerequisite for effective action."
"In the field of supply reduction, the emergence of new synthetic drugs makes it necessary to find ways to respond quickly to the appearance of new substances and consumption trends."
"The establishment of voluntary monitoring mechanisms for new chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of synthetic drugs, as well as enhanced cooperation with trade, will constitute the major priorities in this area."
"Efforts to curb money laundering have to be intensified through the rapid adoption and subsequent implementation of the recently proposed amendment to the money laundering directive."
"Following the Tampere European Council, priority has to be given to the prevention of juvenile, urban and drug-related delinquency and to the progressive harmonisation of European Union legislation on illicit drug trafficking."
"In the past, Member States and the Commission have given insufficient priority to the evaluation of anti-drugs activities."
"This must change."
"Evaluation must become an integral part of the European Union approach."
"The Commission has already begun this evaluation and hopes to do more in the future."
"The observatory in Lisbon can contribute by issuing guidelines for the evaluation of demand and supply reduction activities."
"The implementation of five harmonised key indicators - demand for treatment by drug users, drug-related deaths, mortality and causes of death among drug-users, the incidence of drug-related infectious diseases, the comparability of surveys of drug use, behaviour and attitudes towards drugs in the general population and finally, the comparability of the prevalence estimates of problem drug use - plays an important role in this context."
"Adoption of the European Union drugs strategy for the first years of the new millennium is not the end of the debate."
"I understand that the coming Portuguese presidency will implement the European Union drugs strategy through the presentation of more concrete priorities for the years 2000-2004."
"We will, as well, have the possibility of working together with European institutions on the organisation of an interinstitutional conference to discuss the implementation of the European Union drugs strategy, possibly at the beginning of next year."
"I hope that on that occasion we will be able to evaluate the inter-pillar Council meeting that has been suggested by the rapporteur."
"The Commission's communication represents, in my opinion, a good starting point for a global, multidisciplinary and integrated European strategy to fight illicit drugs on the line that was approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1998."
"The observatory in Lisbon and Europol in The Hague are two important instruments that can contribute significantly to our strategy."
"I am, therefore, confident that we have the potential and will find the political will to respond to the new challenges in the perspective of the 2000-2004 European Union drugs strategy."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"We will interrupt the debate at this point to proceed to the votes."
"This debate will resume at 6.00 p.m."
"Vote"
"Madam President, I would just like to remind you and the Members that the Radical Members present - Mr Della Vedova, Mr Cappato, Mr Dupuis, Mr Dell'Alba and Mr Turco will not be taking part, although they are present, in the votes today either."
"I think that a Parliament that is not brave enough to resolve a situation where some Members and millions of European citizens are patently discriminated against, is a Parliament that cannot teach democracy, as it would like to do and should do, to many countries that, this very morning, we have condemned."
"Report (A5-0061/1999) by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on draft supplementary and amending budget 5/1999 to the budget of the European Union for the 1999 financial year (C5-0257/1999)"
"Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission very much welcomes the report by the rapporteur and it especially welcomes the proposal for an amendment, which has been submitted by Parliament, to reallocate EUR 25 million in the financial framework as opposed to the overall transfer proposal."
"The Commission regrets that the Council has not yet approved Parliament' s proposal."
"It would therefore request the Council to support this proposal in order to smooth the way so that by restructuring and reducing expenditure this year EUR 670 million can be made available for urgently needed foreign policy programmes."
"Thank you, Mrs Schreyer."
"I am sorry that the Council is not represented here."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0066/1999) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)"
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Report (A5-0062/1999) by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Communication to the Council and the European Parliament: The EU Approach to the WTO Millennium Round (COM(1999) 331 - C5-0155/19 - 1999/2149(COS))"
"Madam President, before we proceed to the Schwaiger report vote, could I raise a point of clarification?"
"A split vote has been requested on recital C from our side, but looking at the voting papers, I think that a word may have been included that should not have been. The words in the English text that we want to vote on separately are ""and socially balanced"": those are the separate words."
"Some versions suggest we should also vote on the word ""fair"", but that should be in the main part of the text."
"I hope that is clear."
"Relating to Amendment No 11"
"Madam President, I have the impression that the vote should first be taken on the phrase ""that free and fair world trade"" etc. Is that correct?"
"Have you included that?"
"Mr Schwaiger, I have received requests for split voting, and for separate voting, and I have been asked to take the words ""fair"" and ""socially balanced"" separately."
"I am therefore complying with the requests which have been made."
"Madam President, this proposal is for us Greens an essential proposal."
"If ""fair and socially-balanced"" is omitted, then unfortunately the majority of us will have to vote against this report."
"If it is dropped, then an essential part of the entire negotiations is missing from the whole report."
"I just wanted to make that clear once more."
"Madam President, since the second part is decisive for all of us as to whether we can vote on the first part, I would ask you to vote on the second part first. Then we will know whether, as far as the first part is concerned, we can vote together with the large group which proposes this."
"Mrs Maes, you will acknowledge that it is rather difficult to vote in order to introduce words into a text on which we have not yet voted."
"I feel we must be logical and consistent in our approach."
"Mr President, can I make clear that the Socialist Group wants the words ""free, fair and socially-balanced"" included."
"We are now voting on Amendment No 11 which deletes them."
"Have I understood correctly?"
"So we will vote against this amendment and in favour of the original recital."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, don' t get so worked up!"
"This is an essential point which is really important."
"From the voting point of view, Mrs Maes is quite right."
"Mr Chichester, I am surprised that you of all people wanted to have the point ""socially-balanced"" voted on separately."
"We voted for it by a large majority in the Committee."
"However, the only thing that I should really like to see is that the voting procedure runs properly."
"I would therefore ask you to grant Mrs Maes' request."
"Madam President, I believe we are dealing with three adjectives."
"Free and fair world trade is the basis for the WTO Negotiations - that was my original text."
"A proposal for an amendment was then agreed in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, where ""socially-balanced"" was added."
"The opinions differ as to which adjectives should be added. I feel in any case that it should be ""free and fair world trade"" ."
"Everyone agreed to that. The question of ""is socially tolerable"" or ""socially acceptable"" was disputed."
"We should therefore vote on the original text saying ""free and fair world trade"" and then vote separately on ""socially-balanced"" ."
"Then we would have a result on the third point."
"I should in any case like to point out that ""free and fair world trade"" was the basis of all our work and an addition was appended here on which we should now vote."
"I think there is some muddle."
"The amendment is not the text you read out, Madam President."
"The amendment concerned involves removing some words."
"What we have to do is make a decision as to whether or not these words are to be removed."
"That is the amendment."
"And the second part, is the sentence that follows on and not the sentence which was read out."
"What we are voting on, then, is whether to remove or keep these words."
"Exactly, but we are voting on the removal of two words, first one then the other."
"I propose that we vote first on the removal of the word ""fair"" ."
"Is it only the words ""socially balanced"" which are to be removed?"
"President, we can only vote on the amendment in front of us and the amendment in front of us asks for four words to be deleted."
"We will vote against that amendment. No other amendment is possible."
"I will explain as carefully as I can."
"The original text says, and this is the original text as voted in committee: ""Whereas free, fair and socially-balanced world trade must be further developed and consolidated"" etc."
"Amendment No 11 says in its first part: ""Whereas (delete four words)""."
"We are ready to vote on that."
"I have said that we will vote against it."
"There is then a further amendment to Amendment No 11, which is in two parts."
"But I think we can vote the whole of Amendment No 11 now, which deletes the four words ""free, fair and socially-balanced""."
"No-one has agreed to an oral amendment of any sort."
"Madam President, I should like to repeat once again that there was a proposal for an amendment by the PPE. There was an oral explanation by Mr Chichester, that against the amendment he wished to keep the words ""free and fair"" in any case and that we should take a vote on that."
"The third question is ""socially-balanced"" , ""yes"" or ""no"" ?"
"We should vote on that."
"I have now understood what Mr Chichester said to me."
"Madam President, my request was a clarification."
"If we get to vote on the original text of that paragraph, if we get past the vote on the amendment, at that point I want to propose a vote on the words ""and socially-balanced"" separately from the rest of the text."
"I am not proposing an oral amendment."
"We should proceed to vote the amendment first."
"Depending on the result of that, my point is that I am proposing a separate vote on the original text."
"So I am not proposing an oral amendment."
"I think that that clears matters up."
"We have this Amendment No 11 from the PPE Group for the removal of these words, and this is what I shall now put to the vote."
"This is not the opportune moment, I feel, in the middle of a sitting, to want to put the finishing touches to an oral amendment."
"Indeed I can see that Mr Chichester has the wisdom to abandon this course."
"Madam President, I am speaking now because I believe that I can propose a solution that is quite correct."
"We are dealing with three terms: fair, free and socially-balanced."
"Both the words ""fair"" and ""free"" are as far as I can see desired by a large majority."
"The only disputed point is the term ""socially-balanced"" ."
"That was also what Mrs Maes said first of all, so it would be easiest if we voted separately on each of these three words, then we shall have the majority opinion of the Parliament on each of the three words."
"The request itself is unclear."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to your understanding."
"The important thing is that we know what we are voting on."
"In negotiations as important as the ones involved here, it is essential for our message to be extremely clear, and, if you agree, I think we may indeed create a subdivision..."
"Madam President, our Rules of Procedure do not allow for a secondary market in amendments."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists strongly opposes..."
"... the underhand introduction of an oral amendment, with the excuse of clarifying an issue."
"Oral amendments require the acceptance of the groups and this group is opposed."
"Voting cannot be done à la carte."
"Mr Barón Crespo, if I have understood properly, there is a request for an oral amendment."
"But there is no need for Members to stand up, matters are perfectly clear."
"The request for an oral amendment is rejected. We take good note of this."
"I shall now put to the vote Amendment No 11 tabled by the PPE Group. This involves removing the words we have been talking about."
"Relating to Amendment No 25"
"Madam President, this is about Amendment No 25."
"I would like to say that the text of this amendment is entirely compatible with the rapporteur' s text, and, for this reason, I think that it should be voted on as a supplement."
"And, because it is entirely compatible, we should vote in favour of it."
"Relating to Amendment No 18"
"Madam President, there is in fact a very serious translation problem because the English text says the following: ""Believes that the EU should ensure that WTO rules relating to the agricultural sector do not have an adverse effect on the economies of developing countries and that security of food supply should be considered as a multifunctional aspect of agriculture""."
"You will see that the French version says the opposite!"
"This may happen more often than we think but fortunately this was noticed on this occasion."
"Please vote bearing in mind the English original."
"Absolutely, Mrs McNally."
"My impression is that the Members of this House are very attentive."
"Indeed they often point out problems of this kind, which are of course most regrettable."
"Following the vote on paragraph 29"
"As a point of order, Madam President, Rule 117 stipulates that either one language or the other must be used."
"But the French version is peppered with English expressions which make the text quite incomprehensible."
"So, admittedly, in the case of an operation such as Seattle, since it is entirely American, it is only to be expected that the language of empire is going to pervade everything."
"But if you are going to claim to be using the French language, then French terms must be used."
"Madam President, so as not to delay the debate too much, I would like to make an overall comment regarding all my amendments."
"I submitted a great number of amendments in French and signed them myself."
"Now, I see that the French version which has been distributed officially is not identical to the version I gave to the services."
"This is not right."
"It is not a translation problem."
"Somewhere in the sessional services there is an anonymous reviser who goes around correcting the ideas of the Members of Parliament."
"I should like the version which I signed and submitted to the sessional services to be restored."
"Mr Berthu, there is no wicked anonymous reviser."
"The truth is that two of your amendments were not in fact very clearly expressed, and I shall read them out, when the time comes, so that the Members of the House may see the facts for themselves."
"I have been fully informed of this problem, and we apologise for it."
"Following the vote on Amendment No 70"
"Madam President, to save time, now that Amendment No 70 from the Europe of Nations Group has been rejected by an overwhelming majority, could you apply the provisions of Rule 130(7), which states that the President may decide, following the adoption or rejection of a particular amendment, that several other amendments of similar content or with similar objectives be put to the vote collectively."
"You may seek the agreement of Parliament before doing so."
"Such a set of amendments may relate to different parts of the original text."
"This was introduced into our Rules precisely for this sort of situation."
"We should now be able to vote en bloc on the rest of Mr Berthu's amendments."
"Mr Corbett, I have examined the problem thoroughly."
"In all sincerity, I do not think I am entitled to do so, since that would force me to put the subsequent amendments to a vote en bloc."
"On the other hand, Mr Berthu who has asked for the floor is perhaps going to tell us that he is withdrawing his amendments."
"This would be the simplest solution."
"The decision is, of course, his."
"Following the vote on Amendment No 50 Berthu (UEN)."
"(FR) No, Madam President, we did not request voting by roll call in order to facilitate the voting."
"Having said that, I wish to retain my amendments."
"There is no text prohibiting a Member of Parliament re-submitting amendments he considers politically important in plenary, even if they are rejected in committee."
"I am therefore entitled to do so, and I wish to retain them."
"Madam President, this is the fourth time that an amendment from the EPP Group has been voted against by the EPP Group."
"I should like to ask that group in future to check how many of individual Members can table amendments in plenary - 15 different Members of the EPP have tabled amendments to this report, supposedly in the name of the group before wasting our time in plenary."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Relating to paragraph 17"
"Madam President, before we go on to Amendment No 5, I should like to point out that we have not quite finished voting on paragraph 17."
"There was a request from our Group for a split vote on the last few words."
"I agree those last few words have now been modified by one of the amendments we accepted, but we would still like to have a separate vote on those last few words of the paragraph."
"Madam President, I believe that Mr Corbett, instead of concerning himself with the amendments of the Group of the European People' s Party, should concern himself with clarifying the situation of the members of his Group."
"This would surely be a great improvement."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this late in the morning, we need a little humour."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, we already mentioned this earlier this morning: The important report by Mr Pirker, according to what we have now voted on, although we proposed something else this morning, must in the normal procedure be voted on this afternoon or early tomorrow."
"The same applies to Mrs Giannakou' s report."
"Two unusual things that will hopefully not be left to some chance majority."
"I would therefore request that we adjourn the vote on the Pirker and Giannakou reports and the debates until the December part-session in Brussels and would request that we vote on this."
"Mr Schulz, we heard the Commissioner this morning speak on the subject of Mr Pirker' s report."
"As far as I know, this evening and tomorrow too, most certainly, many of the Members of the European Parliament will be in attendance, as we have been able to note in the past."
"I shall ask Mr Pirker. You wish to vote this evening of course."
"Madam President, the same applies to my report."
"We have to go to Helsinki with this."
"So, tomorrow, we need to proceed to a final vote."
"This is the reason why the committee worked so quickly."
"Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, we shall not be voting tomorrow, we shall be voting this evening, but since the debate on Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report has not yet been concluded, the case is slightly different."
". (DE) Madam President, we discussed Mr Schulz' s proposal this morning and voted on it."
"For good reasons there was a clear majority in favour of taking the vote today."
"Otherwise we would have not had Eurodac by the beginning of next year but the next debates would have been held sometime during next year and Eurodac would maybe have come a year later."
"That would be irresponsible and there was therefore a clear decision by the Parliament to take the vote today."
". (DE) Madam President, we asked for a split vote here, on the one hand, with regard to the amendment on raising the age limit from 14 to 18 and for the rest with regard to the expression ""national of a third country""."
"I would ask that there be a separate vote here."
"We are putting Amendment No 3 from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to the vote, excluding ""third country national"" and ""18 years of age"" , and we will re-introduce these, if necessary."
"Madam President, we shall now have to work very accurately, otherwise the report will have a completely different meaning."
"If I have understood Mr Pirker correctly, he would like to reject the definition of a ""national of a third country"" and the age of 18."
"Is that correct?"
"Please could he just explain that?"
"Madam President, may I explain?"
"I should like the expression ""national of a third country"" to remain in the text."
"We had it just now in a paragraph."
"I should nevertheless like the opportunity of voting in one paragraph on the age limit."
"Because we have declared that we support the age of 14, but there are other opinions, namely to retain the age of 18."
"That is to say, I therefore request a separate vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I have been trying since before the last vote to get the attention of the Chair."
"It seems I have to come down to the very front to do that."
"It is ridiculous."
"I wanted to put that on the record because normally, if I make a mistake on a vote, I put it in writing afterwards."
"I made a mistake."
"My vote registered that I was in favour of the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference. I was very much against it."
"I would like that put on the record now, rather than tomorrow, because it is of fundamental importance to me, coming as I do from a neutral country."
"I find it very difficult to get the attention of the Chair."
"When you are up there you seem to just look at the front and the centre."
"It is very difficult to get attention, which is quite frustrating."
"Thank you very much Mrs McKenna."
"We shall proceed in accordance with your wishes."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Report: Napolitano (A5-0006/1999)"
"Mr President, the result has come about after a whole series of infringements of the law."
"The provisions of the Rules of Procedure have been infringed on many occasions by the departments and by the majority of the Parliament."
"Moreover, the result is a black day for the Parliament, because through it, what the majority of the Parliament has decided, the Parliament becomes an authority and the Members officials."
"I shall, however, not let my own Parliament make me into an official."
"If I think about it, the fact that the Members of Parliament according to this text are bound to assist in the work of OLAF and if they are moreover obliged to inform on people, then such a rule affects the independent mandate most profoundly."
"I should like to state that such a decision that destroys the parliamentary system can clearly not be accepted but that we, and not myself alone, but many others too, will submit this matter to the European Court of Justice."
"- (FR) We have no intention of sanctioning the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"Although this office has been established with the excuse of supervising the officials and elected representatives of the European institutions, the way this office has been designated and the lack of any indications as to how the Office itself will be monitored do not inspire the slightest confidence in us."
"We are in favour not only of total transparency regarding the operation of all European institutions, but also of the election and the admissibility, at any time, not only of all those elected today, but also all those who have any responsibility at whatever level, from the top of the scale to the bottom, including the Commission in Brussels."
"Given the non-democratic nature of the European Union' s decision-making bodies, the establishment of OLAF appears to be a derisory measure intended to provide a semblance of supervision even though there is no real, democratic supervision."
"- (SV) If we had had the opportunity to devise the Rules of Procedure and the interinstitutional agreement on our own, we should have tried to create an open and simple administration, for that is the best kind of administration for the purposes of discovering irregularities and acts of fraud."
"We should also like to point out that the freedom to provide information which we have in Sweden for civil servants is also a good way of preventing illegal occurrences from being swept under the carpet."
"In the situation which has now arisen, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole in the final vote, for to vote against it could be interpreted in terms of our not wanting to regulate the fight against fraud at all."
"- (FR) The Members of the Front National within the European Parliament are staunch in their condemnation of corruption be it corruption of elected representatives, officials or members of governments."
"They also condemn fraud or the misappropriation of public monies, the money stolen from European taxpayers."
"It is a matter that we know something about, we French, who have to contend daily with the repercussions of the cases involving the Mutuelle nationale des étudiants de France, the Paris Mayor' s office, Elf or Gifco."
"This list is, alas, far from complete."
"They will, however, be voting against the Napolitano report."
"Because they are sick to death of the self-flagellation that this Parliament indulges in, alternating with lessons in morality and a haughtiness that is just as hard to bear."
"Because they think that OLAF is an excuse to recruit yet another team of officials, costing more than the cost of the fraud itself."
"Because, above all, they consider that there already is a structure capable of taking on the role which OLAF is expected to fulfil."
"The solution, obviously, is to give the Court of Auditors jurisdictional power and adequate human and material resources to take on this role."
"This is the case of many national audit authorities, not only in France, but in other Member States."
"It is true that the Court of Auditors does not get a good press in this House since the President refused it a press conference room, even though he happily gives one to the most eccentric associations, to individuals whose representative nature is highly dubious, or to any old watchdog in favour of the philosophy of the Single Europe on condition that he barks loud enough."
"In this matter, as in many others, Parliament has made itself look foolish."
"- (DE) The fact that fraud control must be taken seriously is beyond doubt because of recent events and also because the interests of the citizens concerned need better protection."
"With this in mind, OLAF should finally be able to commence its work."
"We are so concerned about the monitoring of the institutions by OLAF and so little can we identify with the ""informing provisions"" proposed in the inter-institutional agreement between the Commission, the Council and Parliament and moreover attacking the independent mandate of the individual Members of Parliament."
"If it says in Article 2, that ""any official or servant of the European Parliament who becomes aware of evidence which gives rise to a presumption of the existence of possible cases of fraud,...shall...inform without delay..."" then this compels them to inform."
"The planned form of monitoring by OLAF can only be a transitional solution and our agreement will only serve to set the necessary monitoring in motion."
"Our agreement does not mean that we approve of the methods criticised, for, as with any compromise, you have to make concessions here in order not to jeopardise the goal."
"- (FR) There is indeed corruption."
"Both in the left wing in power and in the right wing in government."
"The names of the cases tell the whole story: Agusta in Belgium, Urba in France, Palermo in Italy, fictitious jobs in the Parisian public transport network - RPR, the Mutuelle nationale des étudiants de France or Dominique Strauss-Kahn."
"But, because we in the Front National do not suffer the anxiety affecting the potential accused in the other parties, we are rejecting the extension of police powers to that tool of the Brussels Commission that goes by the name of OLAF."
"Firstly, because OLAF contravenes the idea of the separation of authority, which is the bedrock of Western democracy, with officials who have no legitimacy supervising the representatives of the sovereign states."
"Secondly, because OLAF is the thief set to catch the policeman, since the European Commission, at the centre of the suspicions of corruption, is in fact, by means of OLAF, going to be supervising the Parliament, whereas it is Parliament which should be doing the supervising rather than being its target."
"Finally, OLAF does not attack the causes of corruption, which lie in the removal of national borders allowing freedom of movement for drugs money, fraud and financial crime."
"If we really wish to fight the simple symptoms of corruption, while respecting the foundations of legitimate societies, then there are just two ways:"
"either the technical route, by transforming the European Court of Auditors into a court of law and a court of budgetary discipline;"
"or the democratic route, by creating a body at the heart of the European Union, as in Great Britain and the United States, which is the equivalent of the British ""National Accounting Office"" (NAO) or the American ""General Accounting Office"" (GAO)."
"The latter are powerful autonomous supervisory bodies, but are located at the heart of the parliaments, and have a staff of up to 5,000."
"So, the expert body does exist, but with a connection to the representatives of the people who alone have the right to ask for explanations regarding the use of their taxes."
"Report: Schwaiger (A5-0062/1999)"
"In our view, the preparations for the forthcoming round of international trade negotiations is not at all satisfactory as regards procedure, and this is due to at least three reasons."
"Firstly, we can see the European Union weakening its own position, according to the familiar process, by means of its internal discussions, even before the start of negotiations."
"For example, the final mandate granted by the Council on 22 October, makes no mention of defending the principle of Community preference, a principle which had however been adopted by the Agriculture Council of the 27 September, which was itself only partly satisfactory since it omitted the principle of Europe' s autonomy in terms of foodstuffs."
"We come down a notch at every stage."
"There are many more possible examples."
"Thus, regarding our preference system for importing bananas from overseas, the Commission has just made proposals which meet with American demands even before the opening of the Seattle Conference."
"In every field, one might say that the internal concessions made in order to arrive at a unified European position, declared beforehand to be desirable, are leading us to reduce our claims even before starting discussions with our competitors."
"Secondly, the Commission was given a comprehensive negotiation mandate on a whole series of issues, some of which come under Community jurisdiction, but others, such as services or investment, which are clearly in the remit of national authorities."
"Admittedly, it is a mandate for the framing of negotiations and not for the consequences of these negotiations."
"Nonetheless, the Council, without explicitly saying so, has just set in train a process which may lead it, if it is not stopped, to an absolute negotiating mandate being granted to the Commission and thus, in application of the new Article 133(5) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to the ultimate power of ratification being taken away from the national parliaments, but still without clearly declaring this, obviously."
"We are currently drifting off our course in the fog, without knowing exactly at what point we are going to go over the edge."
"Then we will be told that it is too late."
"Such methods are perfectly reprehensible."
"Thirdly, despite our requests, we note that the Seattle negotiations are going to be undertaken before a clear, specific and comprehensive report has been made of the consequences of the Uruguay Round."
"There too we shall be advancing in the dark."
"The Commission did, admittedly, give in on one point, since it is going to proceed to the evaluation of the impact on sustainability, as I was saying, i.e. on the environmental consequences of liberalisation."
"That is all very well."
"But this study should have been carried out on many other points, such as the impact of liberalisation, in its current form, on the preservation of cultural and social models."
"For these three reasons, in these circumstances, we are unable to approve the opening of the Seattle negotiations."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained on the report, which it considered rather wet."
"As far as we were concerned, the objective of this report was to give Commissioner Lamy a specific negotiating mandate for the Round due to open in Seattle."
"Well, such a specific mandate has not been adequately asserted."
"That being the case, we would have liked Parliament to propose a very political specification to the Commission, instead of drawing up a more diplomatic report which deplores, stresses and considers but does not give any sort of mandate."
"The tone of the report is still too liberal, then, for us to find any reflection of our own views, especially since none of our amendments is included in it."
"The report, thus amended, has significant weaknesses regarding TRIPS."
"We can find nothing acceptable to us in it on the subject of intellectual property rights relating to trade."
"As regards the MAI, which was rejected by the OECD and which is coming back again, a reinforced code of conduct must be drawn up for investment and strict regulations must be drawn up in this field, and this is equally applicable to the settlement of disputes."
"The report does, however, include some fundamental principles which we consider essential such as the precautionary principle, regulations on production methods and procedures."
"It stresses in particular the labelling of foodstuffs in order to ensure the implementation of food safety, and the necessity of adopting a stance that is more favourable to developing countries."
"At any event, we shall follow with great interest the way in which the Commission conducts the negotiations, and even though we still find this amended report too liberal in tone, you will find that we Greens will defend this text most fiercely if Commissioner Lamy should step below the recommendations made here."
"- (SV) Free world trade is necessary in order to increase worldwide growth and help reduce the gulf between rich and poor."
"However, large numbers of the poor in the developing countries have still not benefited from free world trade."
"We therefore share the view expressed in section B that the developing countries' interests and problems must have priority in any extended system of free world trade."
"The free trade system is urgently required if we are to reduce poverty and create a more just world."
"We therefore consider that the overarching strategies and objectives, as described in the report, for the forthcoming round of World Trade Organisation negotiations are a step in the right direction in relation to the Commission' s communication."
"If, however, the objectives are to become a reality, we should particularly like to emphasise section I, to the effect that agriculture must be one of the areas in the multilateral trade negotiations where new possibilities are opened up in Seattle."
"We think that what is prescribed in this section must become a reality in relation also to sections 5, 6 and 7."
"If this agreement is really to become the development agreement which helps reduce the gulf between the world' s rich and poor States, it is not acceptable to reject, in advance, demands from the other Member States in the World Trade Organisation for a change in our agricultural policy at the Millennium Round"
"To help achieve this objective of reducing the gap between rich and poor States, frontier defences must be lowered and export subsidies phased out."
"The overarching objective in section 37 ought therefore to be that of completely phasing out customs duties on non-agricultural products."
"A development like that would be of greater help to the developing countries than the marginal preferences they at present have."
"The World Trade Organisation should support the work being done in terms of the global environment by, for example, incorporating basic principles of environmental policy, such as the precautionary principle, into its practice."
"It is therefore important that weight be given to section 10 in the negotiations."
"- (FR) The European delegation to the WTO negotiations claims to be the defender of the interests of Europe."
"In fact, it is merely the representative of the most powerful industrialists and financial groups in the European Union, rivals to the American or Japanese trusts in systematically bleeding the planet dry, but all concerned exclusively with increasing their profits at the expense of the workers in their own countries and peoples in poor countries."
"In mentioning the ""workers' fundamental rights"" and ""protection"" of these, particularly in poor countries, the Schwaiger report introduces a touch of cynicism to all the rest."
"But what of the protection of workers, particularly against the tragedy of unemployment, even in the richest countries of the European Union, precisely those which would easily have adequate means to eradicate unemployment if their governments were not concerned primarily by the profits of big business and by making owners and shareholders wealthy?"
"As for the claim of being interested in the working conditions and inhuman wages in underdeveloped countries, this is pure hypocrisy."
"Any number of multinationals who employ a workforce with a practically zero wage, without the advantage of any form of social protection, in Africa or Asia, have their headquarters in France, Germany or the United Kingdom."
"Instead of forcing these multinationals to comply with minimum social legislation, they are going to be content with inviting a few ILO officials as observers to the WTO negotiations."
"We shall not vote in favour of the proposed report, nor shall we amend it, since it is the capitalist organisation of the economy, with or without the WTO, which basically is not amenable to amendment."
"- (FR) The Millennium Round, which is due to start shortly within the World Trade Organisation, the WTO, must provide an opportunity for Europe, since we are bound by the condition of speaking with a single voice, not only to present itself as unified for the duration of the negotiations, but also to demonstrate the utmost firmness with regard to the outcome, particularly as regards agriculture and the cultural exception."
"While, however, the Fifteen have recently adopted a joint negotiation policy in the context of the new round, which promises to be an ambitious one, it must be acknowledged that this basis which looks like the lowest common denominator shared by the Member States, will of necessity suffer a decline in the course of the negotiations."
"Indeed, there is no doubt but that this compromise text, whose birth was so painful, will be subject to many pressures from the American side in the negotiations, even though the homogeneity of the Union is only a façade, and the Union has no legal arsenal available to it comparable with that in the hands of the United States, one that is likely, if necessary, to deter the American side."
"While the organisation of free and fairer world trade must be encouraged and reinforced within the framework of a multilateral commercial system, it must also ensure that all nations, rich and poor, and I am thinking in particular of the countries of Africa, are guaranteed the possibility of making the most of the advantages which this round of negotiations is supposed to be bringing."
"Indeed, although we must wait for the round of negotiations to be completed before passing judgement on the content as far as the results achieved are concerned, the fact remains that, as far as this context is concerned, the overall result could not be deemed completely negative if the nations of Europe were to manage to obtain stricter control of the international regulations regarding competition."
"The establishment of universally recognised common minimum standards intended to oppose any action to restrict competition would already represent significant progress."
"The European Union' s starting negotiating position, which is ambitious in its objectives, is bound not to emerge stronger from a round of negotiations which is in danger of dragging on and on and getting bogged down, particularly given the foreseeable attitude of the United States, which will not rest from attempting to progressively undermine the mandate which has been given to Mr Lamy and which merely constitutes a unified façade that does not successfully conceal the differences in the interests of the Fifteen."
"Furthermore, the content of the final resolution adopted by the European Parliament today includes many points that are not acceptable to France."
"- (FR) the debates on the WTO which have just taken place in this Parliament on the occasion of the Schwaiger report have clearly shown that, as far as Europe is concerned, the forthcoming negotiations are concerned with the future of its social model at least as much as its trade."
"Similarly for the countries of the third world, the question is knowing whether they will still be able to escape the clutches of the mega-multinationals produced by the mega-mergers and stay in control of their own development."
"For the problem is not knowing whether rules are necessary in world trade."
"Everyone is agreed on that."
"The question is knowing whether the rules promoted by the WTO ever since its creation permit fair and sustainable development for all the regions of the world."
"I shall make two observations:"
"Firstly, the liberalisation promoted in the previous rounds and the increase in the volume of trade have been associated with an intensification of inequalities in development on a world scale."
"In theory, the leaps forward achieved by some should drag others along behind, but in fact the opposite has occurred."
"The African continent' s share in world trade is less than 3%."
"Liberal globalisation has proved incapable of providing a solution to the problem of development and still less of promoting fair and sustainable development."
"This is the reason why an assessment of the social and environmental impact of the previous rounds was essential before engaging in a new wave of all-out liberalisation."
"If it has been rejected so consistently, it is because the outcome would have been negative."
"However, for the European Union, the establishment of an analysis shared with the countries of the third world could have been the foundation for the alliance which we are seeking to build with them on the occasion of these negotiations."
"Secondly, the DSB (Dispute Settlement Body), created within the WTO, has demanded that the European Union give up its own standards in fields as fundamental as health and food safety or even its policy of cooperation in the case of the bananas from ACP countries and the outermost regions."
"The question from now on is knowing if it is possible to accept a situation where, if one thing leads to another, decision after decision, ruling on everything on the pretext of settling commercial differences, the DSB may end up establishing itself as a sort of world-wide Supreme Court, imposing its views in all areas on elected governments and parliaments."
"We would then be witnesses to a real seizure of democratic power."
"This is why, in the Millennium Round, Europe must champion another vision of the organisation of commerce and world trade."
"To do so it must assert three main principles:"
"The first is that the objective of this round must be the reduction of inequalities in development between north and south."
"In order to achieve this, the rules of the multilateral trade system must take into account the differences between countries in situations and resources."
"Free trade without taking anything else into consideration means that the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker."
"This is why we cannot accept challenges to the Lomé Agreements and our policy of cooperation in the form in which we have constructed it in the Lomé Agreements with ACP countries, including 39 of the poorest countries in the world."
"On the contrary, we must reassert the commitment undertaken towards them during the recent ACP-EU Joint Assembly."
"Europe must go to Seattle with a vision of globalisation which is opposed to that of a unilateral world dominated by a single power."
"It must promote a vision based on a multipolar world and encourage the formation of regional associations integrated both economically and politically, as we have been doing ourselves for 40 years."
"How could we refuse others what we granted ourselves, after the war, in order to rebuild our industry, our agriculture and our economy?"
"The second principle should be that the WTO must be ""confined"" to a strictly defined role, and sectors which should only come under the remit of the sovereignty of states and the institutions established by citizens, because they concern the very identity of each society, should be kept out of its area of competence."
"Public and social services such as education or health, but also those where consumer safety and collective interests are involved, such as public transport or air traffic control, culture and artistic creation, may not be taken into account as part of trade negotiations."
"We must resist the onward rush towards treating everything in society as saleable commodities."
"In the agreements on intellectual property, Europe must resist the patenting of living organisms, it must guarantee that derogations to the general trade regulations for medicinal products used to fight AIDS and other serious diseases indicated by the WHO are maintained."
"Finally we must defend the principle of the hierarchy of standards."
"Fundamental human rights and the Universal Declaration of 1948, the conventions of the ILO (International Labour Organisation) or conventions on the environment, are in essence superior to the standards governing trade."
"It must not be possible to condemn a state for applying the precautionary principle, for protecting its environment, or for rejecting imports proved to be produced by child labour."
"On the contrary, it must be possible to take an appeal against a WTO decision to the ILO or to the competent bodies of the United Nations."
"We must reverse the unbalanced situation arising from the fact that having multilateral commercial agreements alone has led to the creation of a legal-style body, whereas this was not the case either for the conventions on the environment or the ILO conventions."
"Some of these concerns were taken into account by the rapporteur at the end of the debates within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Unfortunately, in the course of the plenary sitting, the rapporteur and the PPE and ELDR groups introduced a number of amendments into the text which tone down the social and environmental requirements."
"Considering, furthermore, the unfavourable outcome reserved for the amendments proposed by myself and my fellow members of the French Socialist delegation and the GUE/NGL and Greens/ALE Groups, I abstained, Madam President, in the vote on Mr Schwaiger' s report."
"But I believe that one of the most significant elements, on the eve of this new round, one which distinguishes it from the previous rounds, is the intrusion of society, of NGOs and international public opinion into the debate."
"I believe that we should be pleased at this, since it provides the best guarantee that it will not be possible to omit these issues in the course of these negotiations."
"For their entire duration, they will remain at the centre of the debates of the European Parliament, I am sure."
"- (FR) The new round of negotiations of the World Trade Organisation, due to open in Seattle on 30 November, should provide an opportunity to establish better control of the liberalisation of trade."
"But I doubt that this will be the case."
"The doubt concerns our capacity, and our real determination, to make the WTO an instrument of regulation in order to make the transition from globalisation sought by the few and inflicted on all to truly regulated world trade which is of benefit to the whole planet."
"Indeed it is this doubt which gives rise to my concern that if we do not succeed on this point, then we shall be forced to renege on longstanding commitments to developing countries, particularly towards ACP countries, to which we have been linked for 20 years by the Lomé Conventions."
"At the risk of denting our clear conscience, I would at this point like to mention the example of the banana dispute, or the multinationals (Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita) which, with the support of the United States, are flooding the European market with bananas which are the product of slavery, produced, what is more, in conditions of the most dubious food safety and have managed to force us to our knees; a matter in which we are on the verge of unconditional surrender, abandoning hundreds of thousands of growers, not only in ACP countries, but also the farmers of our own Community in Guadeloupe and Martinique, to bankruptcy!"
"And recent statements by the Commission are not such as to allay this concern, saying, for example, that it is necessary to put an end to the banana conflict since it is poisoning transatlantic relations and because the Union would be sending an unfavourable message to the world as the new trade negotiations are dawning."
"Who could possibly be against putting an end to the conflict?"
"No one, of course, but not at just any price, not by surrendering unconditionally."
"The same applies to rum, since we have signed a unilateral agreement with the United States on the import of colourless spirits, and that includes rum, which will inevitably lead in the short term to the economic destabilisation of the entire Caribbean!"
"What will happen tomorrow, unless we are particularly vigilant, in the case of sugar, which is a crucial element in the economic balance of ACP countries such as Mauritius or a European region, such as Réunion, which I know well?"
"The truth is, I am afraid, that whatever our fine statements, often with a touch of paternalism, we are on the verge of writing off our policy with regard to the poorest countries and to ACP countries, in particular, abandoning the farmers in our own outermost regions in the process."
"And yet we have historic links with these countries."
"Let me tell you, it is not just a matter of generosity."
"For many of our countries, which are in fact former colonising powers, it is a very powerful moral commitment which we are honour-bound to respect!"
"Therefore, even though the resolution put to the vote this morning is a text which is perfectly acceptable in terms of the general objective which we have set ourselves, particularly thanks to the many amendments proposed by the members of my group, I did not vote in favour of this text, so as to fulfil the commitments which I have undertaken with regard to the voters in the French Overseas Departments."
"- In the weeks leading up to the agreement of this resolution, many MEPs have sought to ensure Europe's stance is one which genuinely makes this a ""Development Round"" in the WTO, that developing countries are enabled to be full partners in the negotiating process, and to underline that the benefits of trade must be focused to combat increasing poverty in our world."
"The European Commission and Council should heed our clear intentions in this respect."
"On the extension of the WTO too include investment, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has reiterated it strongly held position that the mistakes of the MAI must not be repeated, that investor responsibilities according to ILO and OECD guidelines must be dealt with alongside investor rights, and - by a clear majority - a European Code of Conduct for multinationals (amendment 15) be established."
"I condemn the Conservative group in this Parliament who sought to remove development considerations from the proposed Standing Forum with the ILO, and incredibly sought to remove from our objectives, achieving ""fair and socially balanced"" as well as free trade."
"I am glad they were defeated."
"But the fact that they were prepared to vote for protection of ""strict legal requirements"" met by European farmers, but against the destructive dumping of agricultural goods by us in Europe against peasant farmers in developing countries is scandalous."
"I call on European negotiators to respect our resolution in favour of the principle of food security and for no adverse effect for developing countries in the agricultural negotiations."
"Protectionism by the European Union against the developing world is morally unacceptable and economically short-sighted."
"It is time for it to end."
"- The WTO Millennium Round is an opportunity to manage the process of globalisation."
"Globalisation must be managed in such a way that global challenges are translated into global progress."
"Specific actions are needed in favour of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, using partnerships to reduce inequalities between rich and poor countries."
"Increased coherence between trade, labour, environmental, animal welfare and other internationally accepted regulations and principles of 'corporate governance' through improved cooperation between the WTO, the ILO, the United Nations, the Multilateral Environment Agreements and other international institutions must be mandatory."
"I therefore support the view that the Round be concluded as a single undertaking with results being considered globally."
"I would prefer no agreement to an unfair agreement."
"With regard to the Schwaiger report, a number of amendments have been adopted which condemn the subsidised export of agricultural products from the EU to developing countries."
"The VVD (Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy) recognises that this export can, in some cases, have a detrimental effect on developing countries."
"This problem, however, cannot be solved by unilateral restriction of the EU Member States alone."
"Other countries also subsidise their export and will immediately take the place of the EU when it discontinues the practice of subsidised exports."
"A multilateral approach to this problem is required, whilst nothing is stopping the developing countries from adopting a sound agricultural policy, that is to say preventing or restricting, by means of import levies, the import of these cheap products at the expense of their own agriculture."
"- (FR) Like all my colleagues, I voted against Mr Schwaiger' s report."
"As our chairman, Mr Pasqua, specified in the course of the general debate which took place during the part-session at the beginning of October, and as my colleague, Mr Berthu, has just mentioned, it is essential, before undertaking a new round of negotiations, to make a clear and specific assessment, one that is objective, and thus independent and takes into account the views of both sides, in order to determine the economic, social, environmental and food safety-related consequences of the previous agreements of the Uruguay Round."
"But we observe that, unfortunately, the Council has just given the Commission its negotiating mandate to go to Seattle, and this makes no mention of any such assessment."
"When pushed, they are prepared to undertake a study, only a very limited one, on sustainability, but nothing to do with the preservation of our economic and social identities."
"The failure to carry out an assessment may be analysed as the wish to hide the very mixed reality of the effects of the deregulation of world trade from the peoples of WTO member countries."
"In the course of the years of the Uruguay Round, European agriculture has undergone the most significant reduction in workforce that it has ever known, thus causing the virtual breakdown of rural society."
"A number of developing countries are starting to suffer from the head-on competition to which agricultural products of the Latin America zone and of the Africa zone are subject."
"In the industrial sector, the concentration of some operators brings about situations of dominance over some markets, and small and medium-sized businesses (most particularly those which form the rural fabric of our country), bear the brunt of the unfair competition produced by the relocation of some multinational, or even transnational, enterprises."
"While the need to defend a given European farm model is being asserted, we are avoiding giving it a precise definition by means of Community preference, autonomy in terms of foodstuffs and public health protection."
"It is essential to define very quickly a European farm model based on diversified, traditional and healthy food, produced from essentially European agricultural products."
"The principle of Community preference must be defended and, by the same token, the system of export refunds including for products described as ""outside annex 1"" , i.e. food products produced from European agricultural products whose market price is higher than the world rate."
"The provision of healthy foodstuffs means that the primacy of the precautionary principle should be clearly established in the context of these negotiations."
"This aspect of fair trade based on the absence of dumping for quality, environmental, social and fiscal reasons, if it is mentioned at all among the principles, is not asserted, with all the consequences of this, as a priority objective for European negotiators to attain."
"The prime objective for the Europeans, if you listen to the Commission, would be to get ready to make concessions."
"And indeed that is what the Commission is already doing, even before the negotiations have started, to the detriment of vital European interests."
"I am extremely worried about the European Commission' s attitude."
"Indeed, following the Uruguay Round negotiations, we have had a few conflicts with the American authorities."
"The three main conflicts concerning the banana sector, the production and the incorporation of genetically modified organisms, and the importation of American beef, have all been negotiated by the Commission itself, against the interests of European and ACP banana growers, against the interests of European consumers and, of course, against the interests of our farmers and producers."
"The Commission has acted and is continuing to act in these three case as if it wishes to ensure that there will be no outstanding disputes between the European Union and the United States when the negotiations are due to begin."
"This is playing into the Americans' hands."
"Instead of proclaiming the need for European concessions from the rooftops, the Commission would do better to forcefully assert the need to set right the errors and omissions of the Marrakech Agreement with regard to fundamental social rights, the environment, public health, in the general interest, indeed."
"But this would mean acknowledging that the Commission handled the latest GATT agreements badly, and obviously that is just unthinkable."
"The Commission therefore prefers, whether its representative is called Mr Brittan or Mr Lamy, to undermine our positions in advance regarding the precautionary principle, health safety and environmental protection, as well as economic interests in rural areas and, in the case of bananas, to make light of the special historic relations which our countries maintain in the form of international agreements with the ACP countries."
"Special, do not even think about it."
"The adjective is one that will make Mr Lamy jump with fright!"
"Report: Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen (A5-0058/1999)"
"Mr President, in the first draft of the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the following preliminary clause could be read, ""Considering the rate of abstention from the last European elections, testifying to the growing disaffection of the citizens with regard to the current running of the Union, etc."""
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs, no doubt aghast at such an admission, deemed it more prudent to eliminate this clause, with an overwhelming majority."
"And my group has not subsequently managed to have it reintegrated."
"I feel this anecdote is significant since is clearly shows the spirit in which this report was drawn up."
"There is a refusal to see that the more federal Europe is becoming, the more distant it is becoming from the peoples of Europe, and the more disaffected they are becoming from it."
"Sweeping aside this niggling detail, and many others too, the Commission feels more comfortable in proposing yet more federalism, extending majority voting to the Council, and constitutionalisation of the Treaties."
"It is the same attitude of deliberately closing ones eyes to the facts which prevailed when it came to discussing enlargement."
"People are acting as if extending qualified majority voting, i.e. extending the powers of coercion over minority countries, was going to solve all our problems."
"This is serious self-delusion."
"Standardisation has already gone as far as it can within the Europe of the Fifteen."
"This can be clearly seen with the embargo on British beef and it is unrealistic to believe that it is possible to go further, with yet more constraints, within a Europe of thirty members."
"Two years ago, the Amsterdam Council already came up against this problem and did not manage to solve it."
"The forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will be no more successful in solving it if it continues to work on the same bases."
"The fact is, we need a Europe which is more flexible and accords greater respect to its nations."
"I gave the principles of this in a minority opinion appended to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, and the Union for a Europe of Nations Group developed the consequences of this by proposing twenty-one amendments, all rejected, alas, by the majority in Parliament."
"But the day will have to come when this House acknowledges the impasse in which it is trapping itself by championing a monolithic Europe."
"- (FR) We consider that the European institutions are infinitely more concerned with representing the interests of capital than those of the people in general and the working classes in particular."
"Consequently we shall not adopt a stance on enlargement."
"It is our conviction that the future belongs to a Europe without frontiers between peoples unified from one end of the continent to the other and freed from the de facto power of industrial and financial groups, this being an essential condition for the people to have real control over their institutions."
"What is written about the subsidiarity principle in the report could be significantly clearer."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats in the European Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs have therefore, in the form of Amendment No 5, pressed for the inclusion of the following sentence at the end of section 17: ""The application of the subsidiarity principle, as formulated in the Treaty of Maastricht, must be evaluated."""
"We consider that the time is ripe for such an evaluation and that the European Parliament ought to have written this into its resolution and in that way shown its desire to provide the principle of subsidiarity with more explicit content for citizens in the EU' s Member States."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats view the enlargement of the EU towards the East as being absolutely the most important question for the European Union and will devote themselves to ensuring that the institutional questions are handled by means of a rapid and flexible process, founded upon participation by the applicant States."
"What with the Swedish translations of the amendments only being fully ready on the same day that the vote takes place, we find the handling, including the political handling, of this important report to have been quite extraordinary, as well as unsatisfactory from a democratic point of view."
"The matters left unresolved by the Maastricht Treaty and then by the Amsterdam Treaty, despite its mandate, have now come to the fore once again under the Damocles' sword of enlargement."
"Who stands to gain from further integration of the European Union?"
"The people of Europe who, with every day that passes, watch their democratic and social rights eroded and their democratic victories corrupted in the name of competitiveness and by pressure to support a more and more autocratic structure?"
"I think not."
"With the threat of deferred enlargement or even the withdrawal of the Union behind its original borders and in a bid to win new markets and share the plunder, provided that this can be done without rules, the capitalist system of the monopolies is trying to reconcile its internal differences, which were and which still are significant, in order to serve the common interest: i.e. overexploiting workers and achieving maximum profits."
"Both the proposals of the so-called Wise Men and the Commission' s proposals lead in the same direction."
"Even greater inequality between the peoples of Europe, between the Member States of the European Union and between the candidate countries."
"What other purpose can there be to all these proposals which we hear and which, generally speaking, are incorporated into the report, on voting changes in the Council, on changes to the number or responsibilities of Commissioners, on reduced grass roots representation in the EC following the increase in the number of Member States, other than to strengthen the position of the rich countries of the EU, to strengthen the position of monopoly undertakings, the majority of which are established in those countries and to play down grass roots or national opposition to EU decisions which adversely affect the grass roots and which might even affect national interests?"
"What purpose can there be to the attempt to generalise the voting rule and the substantive, perhaps even formal repeal of the veto, despite deceptive grievances deliberately expounded to the contrary, other than to restrict the potential for grass roots intervention, at least where it opposes the choices made by the forces of capitalism in ""smaller"" countries?"
"How can the people of Europe call for the international role of the EU to be reinforced in the form of a new political and monetary union and a common defence and security policy when the EU is responsible, together with NATO, for the first act of war since the Second World War, i.e. the attack on Yugoslavia, in violation of every concept of international law?"
"Everyone understands that a currency, in the capitalist world, needs an army to defend and impose it."
"This is the purpose behind the proposals for a common foreign and defence policy and an armed wing in the Union."
"So that arms can be used to support the interests of the monopolies against the people of Europe itself and of non-EU countries."
"This was proven by the campaign against Yugoslavia which, in addition to being illegal, was also unnecessary, at least for the reasons quoted, because it was made glaringly clear by the UNO itself, that all the government and mass media claims were shamefaced lies."
"The clearest proof of the type of security being promoted is provided by the Amsterdam Treaty itself, the incorporation of the Schengen acquis, the creation of a Community prosecution service and the keeping of records on citizens' political convictions, ideological stance, trade union activity and love life."
"We are opposed to this EU, this lackey of imperialism and big business, and we are opposed to the reversal which this autocracy means for democracy."
"The EU cannot change with Intergovernmental Conferences, nor do the proposed negative institutional changes represent a change for the better for the people of Europe."
"The people themselves will oppose, intervene and change the power ratios in order to bring down this anti-grass roots, anti-democratic, autocratic structure which exists to serve big business and create a Europe of peace and collaboration, friendship and equality between peoples, real democracy and freedom and economic prosperity for the benefit of the workers."
"- (SV) We consider that the report concerning the preparations in anticipation of the next Intergovernmental Conference is a welcome initiative by the European Parliament."
"The requirements in the report extend beyond what the European Council considers ought to be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"We also consider that it is far-reaching on a number of points."
"Section 13 (on providing the EU with a constitution and dividing the texts of the Treaties into two parts): We want to point out and clarify the fact that the only acceptable procedure when it comes to the constitutional part is unanimity."
"Section 14 (on the revision of the Treaties): We consider that unanimity shall prevail when the Treaties are revised in accordance with section 13 a."
"Section 17 (last part): We consider that unanimity shall apply not only in the constitutional part but also, for example, in the case of foreign and security policy."
"Section 26, last part, may be interpreted in terms of the provision of reciprocal military guarantees."
"We consider this to be unacceptable."
"The EU has neutral and non-aligned States among its Member States."
"For these, it would be inconceivable that resources should be created for reciprocal military guarantees within the context of the European Union' s security and defence policy."
"Moreover, we do not consider that a precise and binding timetable for the common foreign and security policy is required over and above what was stated in the Cologne document."
"Where section 27 is concerned, we view as considerable progress the fact that the so-called Petersberg Tasks in the Cologne document (humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace-making) are to be incorporated into the EU' s range of tasks."
"This demonstrates that the EU is, in the first place, a political, social and economic project, including when it comes to conflict and crisis management."
"The Petersberg Tasks mean that non-aligned and neutral States have an opportunity to participate in conflict and crisis management and, for that reason, there is no basis for integrating the WEU fully into the European Union."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against Mr Dimitrakopoulos' s and Mr Leinen' s report."
"The enlargement of the EU is an historic opportunity to create a peaceful, stable and cooperative Europe."
"At the same time, it is the EU' s greatest challenge to date."
"A change to the Treaties is a prerequisite for preparing the EU to admit the new Eastern and Central European countries."
"It is now 10 years since the Berlin Wall came down."
"We agree to the timetable which has been proposed so that the Intergovernmental Conference might be concluded by the end of the year 2000."
"It must not be formalities such as changing the Treaties which postpone admission of the new countries."
"That is why we must also be careful not to place obstacles or stumbling blocks in the way of the Intergovernmental Conference's ending on time and of its results being approved in the individual countries in accordance with the regulations in the respective countries' constitutions."
"Mr Dimitrakopoulos' s and Mr Leinen' s report paves the way for a very thorough overhaul which we do not think it will be possible to implement within the established time frame. We have therefore voted against it."
"The many amendments and the many different opinions which have been expressed in connection with the vote today illustrate as clearly as one could wish the problems which a very comprehensive agenda would entail."
"As members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we have voted, together with our fellow party members, for and against a range of amendments."
"We have done so because we want European development to move in a characteristically social democratic direction."
"This does not however alter our general view of the report."
"There are however a number of points which we must clearly reject, including initiatives which remove the basic principle that it is the Member States which, in accordance with their respective constitutions, should enter into and amend the Treaty concerned."
"We must also clearly repudiate the idea of the EU' s being made into a defensive alliance."
"This is not a task for the EU but for NATO."
"- (DA) I have voted against this decision for the reasons contained in the minority prior opinion delivered by Mr Georges Berthu of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group."
"For technical reasons, it was only possible for Mr Georges Berthus' prior opinion to be delivered in the Committee on behalf of the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group."
"However, the minority prior opinion fully covers my points of view, a fact which I should like to be noted in the relevant record and minutes."
"- (SV) The Intergovernmental Conference is a conference between the Member States' governments."
"It is the Member States' parliaments which are to decide whether its results are to be approved."
"We cannot therefore accept that the European Parliament should be given any form of right to make decisions on questions concerning the Treaties."
"We also oppose the proposal in the report to the effect that the EU should become a legal entity."
"In the same way, the report' s ideas about creating a military EU are alarming and unnecessary."
"The last election to the European Parliament, in particular, showed that EU citizens are some distance away from sharing many Members of the European Parliament' s ideas about a federal EU."
"EU citizens are still focused on the political debate taking place in the national arena."
"The EU debate is reserved for a small political élite."
"We therefore reject the fundamental features of the resolution."
"- (DE) The proposals in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report with regard to the reform of the Treaties in their institutional core areas provide for an extension of the qualified majority decision in the Council."
"Moreover, according to the report, international law as such should be amended, as the Parliament should be granted a right of approval with regard to the conclusion of future Treaties."
"This and many other problem issues fundamentally question the role of the Member States of the European Union as ""Masters of the Treaties"" ."
"We non-attached Members therefore reject this report."
"- (PT) I do not think that the report which has been approved by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and submitted for the approval of this plenary sitting merits a positive response because:"
"1 - It makes requirements for revision beyond those that are laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in such broad and general terms that it is not clear what a new ""full"" agenda is."
"Particularly because it omits points for revision that I consider to be essential and that were agreed on in the opinions of other Parliamentary Committees, such as a revision of own resources, a revision of social cohesion, reform of the CAP, the extension of first Pillar competences in terms of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, reform of the legal system etc..."
"2 - The revision centres on an agenda that essentially only concerns issues of decision-making power and a corresponding new balance between Member States, which will reduce, in the name of fairness, the weight of economically less developed States in favour of the more economically powerful ones, to which it is being attempted to give the mechanisms for strengthening their influence."
"3 - Consequently, it accepts, by giving the Commission carte blanche to propose it, a redistribution of the weighting that each State holds in the wake of what can already be seen in the administrative and operational organisation of the Community executive, which threatens the historical and constituent principle of the European project which has always successfully stood firm on there not being proportionality between population and the weighting of votes."
"4 - Consistent with the positions that I have always maintained in Parliament, regarding a revision of Maastricht and Amsterdam, with the aim of keeping sacrosanct the founding historical balance between large and small countries, I cannot approve this resolution which will open up a ""Pandora' s box"" for a Treaty that accepts as fair the supremacy of some States over others in breach of the principle of the equality of all European citizens."
"That is why I voted against it!"
"- (PT) The new Intergovernmental Conference which is due to open at the beginning or in the middle of next year' s first term obviously takes on great importance for the Community agenda for the near future."
"Not so much because the issues are new - some of them were included in the last IGC and not resolved - but certainly because of the complexity and sensitive nature of the issues that constitute the raison d' être of the forthcoming conference."
"With the argument for enlargement, the realisation of which does not present us with any fundamental problems, but which we do not envisage being achieved without consequences at various levels - and in the name of efficiency and democratic behaviour, an amendment to the Treaties, particularly in the institutional domain, is being aimed for. This means giving up unanimity and extending decision making by qualified majority to new areas; it means a new weighting of votes in Council decision making by qualified majority; and it means changing the composition and functioning of the institutions in terms of the number of Commissioners, the Council Presidency, the composition of the EP or even the choice of working languages."
"These are, in fact, changes that essentially target issues of power and influence within the EU and, where possible, aim to make viable or consolidate political boards of management around the largest and richest Member States."
"The marginal role that, in this context, it is sought to give to smaller, less developed countries causes us, naturally, to take a very reserved position, one of concern and even outright opposition to the solutions that are being recommended."
"Our position is further reinforced by the solutions sought by some people in the area of security and defence and which aim for a militarisation of the EU, which would thus be consolidated as a European pillar of NATO, a position that we also reject."
"- (SV) I cannot vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report for reasons which include the following."
"The report has a clear supranational character."
"I support cooperation between States, but not the supranational dimension which the rapporteurs advocate and which was clearly rejected in the latest EU election."
"I also oppose the demands for common military defence, especially in sections 26 and 27 which require a ""binding timetable"" for a common defence and security policy which is to guarantee the EU' s external borders."
"Nor can I accept that the WEU should be integrated in such a way that the EU might in the future take measures with the help of credible military resources."
"No exception is to be made for Article 5 which prescribes a mutual responsibility for intervening militarily if another Member State is attacked."
"Sweden is militarily non-aligned, aiming at neutrality in times of war, and may in no circumstances take part in common military defence."
"I consider that it should only be possible to revise the EU' s statute through a unanimous decision in the Council of Ministers."
"Finally, I consider that Parliament ought to concentrate on the changes which must take place if we are to cope with decision making in an enlarged EU."
"Report: Pirker (A5-0059/1999)"
"Mr President, I abstained in the voting on the Eurodac report."
"I did not vote for it because I do not find the procedure and a number of regulations acceptable."
"Of course I regret that people have not seized the opportunity of acquiring a wider consensus on this important issue."
"Because it is necessary for us to be able to take action against those who cross the borders of the European Union with criminal intentions and fingerprints may well offer a solution in this respect."
"This is why I have abstained in a number of crucial amendments, although I agree with the fundamental attitude of my group, who are unhappy about the fact that everyone is being tarred with the same brush."
"- (SV) We should like to emphasise that introducing a system for comparing asylum seekers' fingerprints is not in itself a guarantee of achieving the humane and generous asylum policy we are aiming for and which would mean that Member States showed solidarity in giving asylum seekers the right to sanctuary."
"In order to achieve an asylum policy of this kind, other measures and far-reaching efforts are required to further agreement between the Member States on the need for a generous and humane asylum policy."
"We consider however that the establishment of Eurodac should be seen in the light of the opportunity to achieve such a humane and generous asylum policy within the European Union."
"In the changes to the Commission' s proposal, which find expression in the report, we see reasons for backing the report. These changes will mean that it will not be possible for minors to be subjected to registration and that the right to personal integrity will be strengthened."
"- (DA) The Danish delegation wishes to express its full support for the establishment of Eurodac for the purposes of comparing asylum seekers' and certain other foreigners' fingerprints."
"Eurodac will be a significant tool for ensuring that the Dublin Convention functions efficiently."
"Given the selected legal basis for the agenda, we have declined - out of respect for the Danish reservation in the legal sphere - to participate in the final vote."
"We have noted with great satisfaction that, at the meeting in the Council (legal and home affairs) on 29 October 1999, the Danish government announced that it would participate fully in the Eurodac partnership on an intergovernmental basis."
". (PT) With the argument that we need to simplify the implementation of the Dublin Convention, the Council is trying to revive previous attempts to restrict the fundamental rights of citizens of non-EU countries by means of the creation of a mechanism for collecting fingerprints controlled by a central unit, which will cover not only refugees and asylum seekers but all citizens of third countries who are illegally present."
"The Council' s endeavour to address fundamental rights by including children aged 14 and above is therefore blind."
"But even with the minor amendments that have been approved by the European Parliament, including a minimum age limit of 18 years and a limit on the number of comparisons made of fingerprints to prevent more opportunities for error, this proposal that aims to create a Fortress Europe, closed to other citizens is unacceptable."
"As the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market states, in normal circumstances, fingerprints will only be allowed to be taken from criminals or from individuals suspected of having committed crimes and not from asylum seekers, refugees or citizens of third countries who are illegally present within the territory or on a Member State' s border."
"Thus, the protection of the fundamental rights of the individuals concerned requires that we do not proceed with the creation of a central control system for personal data because, in principle, none of those people may be treated as a criminal or be suspected of being one."
"To make the situation worse, no measures for monitoring and protecting data are being proposed, which leaves open the question of how we can guarantee the implementation of effective sanctions which will serve as a deterrent against actions which are not authorised by the central unit."
"This is the reason I have voted against this report."
"- (FR) We voted against Mr Pirker' s report for, essentially, three reasons."
"Firstly, because the amendments to the proposal for a regulation are far too liberal."
"Next, because, at the insistence of the Socialist/ecologist/Communist government of my country, to my great shame, the regulation itself scandalously omits the filing of the fingerprints of illegal immigrants monitored on the territory of the Union."
"Finally, because the text entrusts the management of Eurodac to a handful of Commission officials."
"You have done away with internal borders."
"In building the Europe of Brussels, Maastricht and Amsterdam, you have created an area of high insecurity where illegal immigrants, drugs, trafficking of many different kinds, and crime may circulate freely, any old how."
"The steps you are proposing today not only through the Pirker report, but also through the reports on drugs or on the counterfeiting of travel documents are pathetic, given the real extent of the dangers to which you are exposing the citizens of Europe."
"The only solution is to re-establish checks at the internal frontiers of the Community; to give the Member State police services adequate human, financial and material resources to fulfil their role of protecting honest citizens, and to cease giving the irresponsible parties of Brussels any sort of jurisdiction over matters of the police, justice, immigration and residence of aliens."
"- (NL) The Dutch delegation in the PSE would hereby declare that it is unable to agree with the Pirker report approved today, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the purpose of comparing fingerprints of asylum seekers and of certain other aliens."
"We are quite convinced that extending the Eurodac system to cover groups of aliens other than asylum seekers is not the right way forward."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 2.35 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Millennium Bug: military, civilian and nuclear sectors"
"The next item is the joint debate on four motions for resolution on the Millennium bug: military, civilian and nuclear sectors:"
"B5-0268/1999 by Ms Plooij-van Gorsel, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the year 2000 computer problem and possible Europe-wide consequences;"
"B5-0268/1999 by Ms Theorin, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the year 2000 computer problem and de-alerting all nuclear forces (B5-0276/1999);"
"B5-0268/1999 by Ms Hautala, Ms Lucas, and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group, on the year 2000 computer problem and possible Europe-wide consequences (B5-0292/1999);"
"B5-0303/1999 by Mr Chichester, Mr Morillon, and others, on behalf of the PPE/DE Group, on the Year 2000 computer Bug and its possible effects."
"Mr President, nuclear weapons are the weapons of the Cold War, but in spite of the fact that the Cold War is over, nuclear weapons are still there."
"Thousands of these weapons are to be found on aircraft, on aircraft carriers and on land, ready for firing, despite the fact that there are no threats to use nuclear weapons."
"To have nuclear weapons ready for immediate firing is a very dangerous situation, mainly because nuclear weapons can be released by mistake."
"This has come close to happening on a number of occasions."
"As recently as 1995, the Russians mistook a Norwegian test rocket for American nuclear weapons and went onto a full-scale war footing in Russia."
"Mr Yeltsin had to be woken up in the middle of the night but, very fortunately, the mistake was discovered before he decided to fire any nuclear weapons."
"The risk of nuclear war by mistake was one of the reasons for the Canberra Commission' s proposal that no nuclear weapons should any longer be held in readiness for firing."
"This view was promoted in particular by the man formerly responsible for the United States' strategic nuclear weapons, General Lee Butler, who himself literally had his finger on the nuclear button for many years."
"He knew how near we had been to unleashing a nuclear war by mistake."
"The second demand we made in order to reduce the risk of nuclear war was to the effect that all nuclear weapons should be separated from their weapon carriers so that sufficient time might be made for serious political deliberations."
"These two demands ought to be put into effect immediately."
"The reasons are that computer errors in nuclear weapons systems precisely at the turn of the millennium can by mistake lead to nuclear war."
"The early warning systems, which consist of a complex network of satellites, infra-red detectors and horizontal radar rely mainly upon the commercial electricity network."
"Even if the Pentagon has double-checked millions of computer components, full safety cannot be guaranteed; nor can it be guaranteed in Russia."
"Because of these serious defects in its early warning system, Russia cannot detect American intercontinental missiles for a period of three hours per day."
"Nuclear power too relies upon the commercial electricity network in order, for example, to maintain the supply of cooling water and to cool down the radioactive core and the spent nuclear fuel."
"If only a part of this protective network is knocked out because of computer errors, an estimated 100 metric tons of heavy uranium core in the reactor will melt down within two hours if the two reserve diesel generators do not function."
"Unfortunately, these reserve diesel generators are only 85 per cent reliable."
"What must happen now is for the world' s nuclear powers no longer to have their nuclear weapons primed for firing and for them to separate the warheads from the weapon carriers, at least for the period of the turn of the millennium."
"Great Britain has already taken the decision to do this."
"Nuclear power stations too must be temporarily closed down or supplied with protective mechanisms at the turn of the millennium."
"It is this with which the resolution is concerned."
"A decision no longer to have any nuclear weapons primed for firing and to remove their warheads (that is to say, to separate the nuclear weapons from the weapon carriers) may at the same time be the beginning of serious nuclear disarmament."
"Mr President, I support this compromise resolution on the year 2000 computer problem."
"Unfortunately, this resolution is not sufficient to do justice to all the important aspects of this subject."
"For this reason, I would mention three points in particular that are of great importance."
"The Japanese government has called on the people to stockpile purchases."
"That shows that the risk associated with the millennium bug is incalculable, and that also applies to Europe of course."
"It is a matter of great urgency that instructions be issued on how to act and that we discuss what could happen."
"Secondly, where is the reply from the EU to the desperate call for help from 27 African states on 21 October this year?"
"They are also asking the industrialised countries for help in overcoming their Y2K problem."
"Thirdly: The main question is, however, where did they get this problem from?"
"This not only applies to Africa but to other countries in the ""developing"" world."
"In all analyses of and discussions on this subject, the developing countries do not play a part."
"But in fact they will be the hardest hit by the change in the date because they have been given old computers from the rich Northern countries that are not year 2000 compliant."
"The serious effect of this will be that food supplies will not be guaranteed and the internal stability of many countries will be threatened."
"43 days before the turn of the century and we are still far from a solution to this problem."
"Here we see the dark side of the so-called global village of information technology."
"Old computers are handed over, along with responsibility."
"I expect rapid action."
"That not only applies to the Y2K problem, because the next problem is almost upon us."
"Many computers have not stored the date of 29 February in the year 2000."
"Everyone is talking about the Y2K problem, the millennium bug, but this problem is not being prepared for at all and it could have much more serious consequences as a result of nobody being prepared for it."
"Mr President, when I was asked to take part in this debate, my initial response was to decline, since I considered that the alarms raised were the result of some millennium phantasmagoria blown up out of proportion by lobbies with a lot to gain from it, including, occasionally, by exploiting the credulity of their clientele for financial gain."
"If, in the end, I have agreed to associate myself to the resolution to be put to the vote in this House, it is because I have been able to gauge the real feeling of some part of public opinion world-wide."
"These concerns, combined with the statements of our fellow Member on the subject of the reaction of the Japanese Government, and of other international bodies, inviting people to take precautions and to lay in stocks in expectation of the anticipated end of the world, have convinced me that the precautions advocated by this Parliament are, in their wisdom, likely to soothe fears and may therefore prove useful."
"Neither the age of a plant nor its location, nor indeed the state-of-the-art design are any guarantee of Y2K date compliance."
"I would not like to be in this building at midnight on 31 December - a mere 43 days from now."
"Lifts, fire alarms - what would work, if anything?"
"There is a serious point to my jesting."
"We only have to think about it."
"This is a modern state-of-the-art multi-million plant."
"In Ireland successive governments have expressed their concern to UK governments concerning the accident rate at the BNFL institutions, particularly the accident rate at Sellafield on the UK's least-populated west coast, only a few miles across from our most populated east coast."
"You may laugh, Mr President, but I am serious."
"It is not a major credible accident I have in mind and I do not mean to be alarmist."
"But I have to put on record my lack of confidence in the British nuclear industry's safety record."
"As a sovereign, non-nuclear nation, we in Ireland have a right to self-determination in terms of our people's health and environment."
"Consultation and communication between our two countries over the years regarding the British nuclear programme have not been good."
"A certain high-handed arrogance has been apparent despite public relations by Sellafield in recent years."
"I conclude by saying that all nuclear nations need to state clearly and honestly their programmes for Y2K date compliance, to assure their own and neighbouring nations of their readiness."
"Even at this late stage it is better we know the problems than adopt a head-in-the-sand approach."
"The first thing I want to say is how warmly I welcome this Parliament resolution."
"This will send a clear signal around the world about how seriously we take the Y2K issue, and it will hopefully act as an example for others to follow."
"Time, however, is clearly running out."
"That means however good intentions are now there is bound to be a risk of failures."
"In particular, the high level of computer interconnections between countries, particularly in the western world, makes it impossible to predict exactly what the failures might be and where they could occur."
"The higher the level of integration, the higher the level of unpredictability."
"The situation in Eastern Europe is also far from reassuring."
"The lack of information coming from there worried the Commission as late as June this year, and the further east you go, the more worrying the situation gets."
"The safest approach is to turn off these plants at the millennium, but how does Lithuania turn off 75% of its generation capacity from Ignalia?"
"By leaving people in the dark without water?"
"The West must offer assistance, so I particularly welcome this resolution's call on OECD countries to provide resources for this."
"I will finish very quickly with an anecdote that would be funny if were it not so serious."
"The US and the Russians recently set up some hotlines them so they could liaise together over Y2K problems, and in all but one of the seven hotlines they set up, they discovered Y2K problems!"
"Nothing will be certain in the weeks ahead, we must act now to reduce the risks around the world and I welcome the contribution this resolution will make to the process."
"Mr President, I shall answer your questions and contributions on those matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the Commission."
"The way we see the situation in the Member States, the nuclear candidate countries with nuclear facilities and in the newly independent states is as follows."
"Let me first point out that very few nuclear power plants do in fact use a computer-based system for the essential part of their safety system."
"The Member States which have nuclear power plants have been working on this question for at least two years, and the information in our possession indicates that the necessary corrective measures have by now been practically completed, as have all works to do with emergency planning."
"In this matter, the Commission has promoted exchanges of know-how and of good practice, but we did not consider it useful to intervene further with our activities in the actions of Member States."
"The case is rather different for some countries of Central and Eastern Europe and some new Independent States, whose response to the problem has been less prompt."
"Some of them, in fact, did not start to concern themselves with this problem until the end of 1998."
"These countries have been supported in their work by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which reviewed their analyses of the extent of the problem in the cases of a considerable number of power plants."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel referred to the operations carried out to date, and my answer to her is this: the operations of the Agency and of countries using nuclear power plants did not reveal any ""bug"" problems in the essential safety systems."
"The Commission provided additional assistance to a number of nuclear power plant operators."
"We financed European Union expert missions to 3 power plants in Russia and to 3 power plants in Ukraine."
"In addition, we offered our assistance to the nuclear regulation authorities as of the beginning of this year, and we are now supporting projects of this type in Bulgaria, Slovakia and Russia."
"Although none of the elements in the crucial safety systems are affected, a number of other systems, particularly the operator display systems, may be affected and failure of these systems may indirectly threaten nuclear safety by increasing the burden on the operators, as has been mentioned."
"According to the information available to us, we think that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have generally made good progress in correcting these systems."
"In comparison, the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union are making undeniably slower progress in their corrective operations, but they are all claiming that the work will have been completed by the end of the year."
"We are supporting these rehabilitation projects by contributing to the activities of two international scientific and technical centres, in Moscow and Kiev, and we are prepared, if necessary, to provide additional assistance to these programmes in consideration of the fact that, as you have said throughout this debate, we are getting extremely close to the transition to the year 2000 and the main thing has been to begin to address the problem in good time."
"This is my answer, and this is our contribution to solving this important problem."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. today."
"East Timor"
"The next item is the joint debate on five motions for resolution on East Timor:"
"(B5-0271/1999) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in East Timor;"
"(B5-0273/1999) Ms Figueiredo, Mr Miranda, and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in East Timor;"
"(B5-0280/1999) Mr Seguro, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in East Timor;"
"(B5-0289/1999) Mr Queirò, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in East Timor;"
"(B5-0299/1999) Ms Hautala, Ms McKenna, and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group, on the situation in East Timor."
"Mr President, it has, in fact, been possible once again to reach an agreement between all the political groups and to present a single motion for a resolution on Timor."
"This motion for a resolution is a clear signal to the international community that, in spite of the fact that news about Timor has disappeared from the major European newspapers and that it is no longer the leading item on the most important European television news broadcasts, the international community and the European Union must continue to be attentive to this problem."
"Firstly, because abuses of the human dignity and of the human rights of the Timorese who are refugees in other parts of Timor, particularly in West Timor, and who want to return to East Timor are still taking place. The Indonesian authorities must, as a matter of urgency, make humanitarian action possible, particularly on the part of non-governmental organisations."
"Secondly, there must be greater vigilance by the peacekeeping forces at the border so that those Timorese who do have the right to return to West Timor can do so safely."
"On the other hand, those responsible for the massacres and for the attacks on human life must be punished, not just to ensure that justice is done in Timor, but, indeed, to set an example for other parts of the world where, sadly, attacks on dignity and, above all, on life, which we feel is an inalienable right, still exist and continue to take place."
"Finally, Mr President, our intention is for the Commission and the Council to match the condemnations and political speeches with an appropriate expression of financial and technical support for the process of independence and the reconstruction of East Timor."
"This is why the Socialist Group supports this resolution and this was what I wanted to say."
"I would like to support very much what the last speaker has just said."
"With regard to the situation in East Timor we really need to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian authorities, because they seem to be turning a blind eye to a lot of what is happening there."
"The Indonesians must try and halt the militia and their activities in the area."
"There is also the UNHCR fear that the situation is actually going to worsen."
"It is not just in East Timor, but also in West Timor where there are still a huge number of refugees - an estimated 250 000 refugees."
"As regards the international agencies, we have to ensure that the UNHCR's repatriation programme is allowed to continue without any kind of disruption, because there have been a number of incidents in recent times which point to a deliberate attempt to try and disrupt the UNHCR's repatriation programme."
"It is essential that this programme is allowed to continue."
"Indonesia itself must facilitate the work of relief agencies and the international forces so as to ensure that peace and stability return to the area."
"We in the European Union, along with the United Nations, all encouraged the East Timorese to exercise their right to vote in the referendum."
"What happened after that was completely and totally unacceptable, though predictable."
"In fact it was predicted long before it happened, and action should have been taken much earlier to prevent the atrocities and the murder of innocent people."
"Unfortunately, a huge number of people lost their lives because of the irresponsible attitude of the international community."
"Since then, some countries have woken up to the fact that they can no longer stand by idly and watch Indonesia with the support of the militia organisations in that area murdering and chasing the East Timorese out of their country."
"It is about time that they had the right to independence - it is what they voted for."
"Member States of the European Union have to support them - not just with words but also financial assistance."
"Mr President, the developing situation in East Timor must continue to enjoy the complete attention of the European Union' s institutions."
"In spite of the positive measures that were taken following Parliament' s resolution on September 16 last, specifically the entry of the international peace and security force under the auspices of the UN and INTERFET, the humanitarian safety situation remains serious both in East Timor itself, which it is essential to provide with resources to support reconstruction, and for approximately 250 thousand people forcibly displaced to Indonesia and, particularly, to West Timor."
"Therefore, it is crucial that the European Union, the Member States and the whole international community maintain firm pressure on the Indonesian authorities so that they disarm and control the so-called ""militias"" with the utmost urgency and they create the necessary conditions of safety for the refugees to return to East Timor, whose territorial integrity should be respected in its entirety."
"It is equally vital for words to be replaced with action and humanitarian and financial aid to East Timor to actually be provided."
"The delay in the arrival of the aid promised by the European Union, despite the promises made by the Council and the Commission, is unacceptable."
"And as approval of the budgetary line for the next few years has been positive, it is vital that the necessary sums be provided for economic and financial support for the reconstruction of East Timor and for its transition to independence."
"Finally, it is important to reiterate the fact that the decisions on the East Timor independence process are a matter for its people."
"This means respecting its sovereignty, so decisions on its present and its future must be taken in close collaboration with the National Council for Timorese Resistance, as it is not for international organisations to replace the people of East Timor but to give them all the necessary support."
"Therefore this is an appeal for all Member States, the institutions of the European Union and the whole international community to keep support for the people of East Timor on the agenda and to take the first steps towards the international recognition of the State of East Timor Lorosae and the respective establishment of diplomatic relations."
"Mr President, this week sees the start of the United Nations transfer of authority in East Timor to UNTAET."
"They do not have an easy task."
"The situation of delay, made worse by the vindictive destruction perpetrated by the Indonesian armed forces, the small size of the territory together with the fact that there is another half to the island, the coexistence with neighbours and powerful interests and the lack of an administration are all factors that contribute to the complexity of the task and show the need for the involvement of the Timorese and the importance of international solidarity."
"The next two years must be won."
"We must build basic infrastructures, establish bases for production, install an administration where none currently exists and do so taking into account the will and the involvement of the Timorese people."
"They know what they want and have the right to participate from the outset in their country' s construction."
"With regard to international solidarity, it is clear that the joint assessment mission, coordinated by the World Bank and in which elements of the Commission participated, has finished its work in the area."
"An estimate of the costs of reconstruction has been made - EUR 250 million over three years - and a conference of donors will be held on 17 December."
"The data that has been made available is very useful for Parliament too."
"I must point out that after the referendum on August 30 we were already expressing our desire for the European Union to become actively involved in the tasks of reconstruction."
"In line with this desire, when, at first reading, we took a stand on Budget 2000, we established a specific point of a multiannual nature with EUR 30 million allocated to the reconstruction of East Timor, an amount that should be increased in view of the information provided by the joint assessment mission."
"In conclusion, I would like to highlight the tragic situation of the 250 thousand refugees outside East Timor: the whereabouts of several dozen thousands of people is not known and many of those we do know about are women and children."
"The refugee camps are dominated by those militias who, having terrorised East Timor, are continuing to do the same in Indonesian territory."
"In the meantime, Indonesia is keeping its land borders closed."
"The situation is intolerable and is affecting a third of East Timor' s population, which has the right to a free and informed choice as to whether they stay in Indonesia or return to East Timor."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Union for a Europe of Nations, I would like to state that I am one of the authors of this report and to say that this is our best opportunity to keep the issue of East Timor on the international agenda."
"There is no doubt at all that there are still many problems, both in the area of humanitarian aid and in that of support for reconstruction, and also because we are still seeing serious violations of human rights, particularly in West Timor, with the activity of the militias which have prevented the refugees from East Timor regrouping and returning to their homes and to their land."
"These are the reasons that lead me to agree wholeheartedly with this resolution, and also even to highlight again the need for there to be a specific investigation into who is responsible for the massacres that have taken place and for the appropriate judicial authorities to punish those responsible."
"I would also like to highlight the proposal that has been made to send a new delegation from the European Parliament to East Timor precisely to verify in loco how this process of reconstruction is taking place and being handled, and in order to have all the necessary facts to enable us to continue maintaining East Timor as an issue that deserves the unanimous attention of all European Members of Parliament."
"The redevelopment of East Timor, in terms of its extent and its political specificity, is an important task for us and for the entire international community."
"Within the framework of the United Nations, we must all contribute towards finding an overall solution to this problem, including issues relating to human rights and the establishment of a new state."
"In this context, I am pleased to see that Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, the new United Nations coordinator, arrived in East Timor last Tuesday."
"I feel we can wish him nothing but success in this difficult assignment on behalf of the Commission, for my part, and on behalf of the Parliament and the European Union."
"You know that the Commission is fully committed to shouldering its responsibilities as regards humanitarian and redevelopment operations."
"In response to Mrs Maij-Weggen' s question on humanitarian aid, ECHO has to date committed EUR 5 million and there is a further decision concerning EUR 10 million ""in the pipeline"" , as it were, in order to complete the work we are currently undertaking on the spot."
"We have responded to international appeals and have currently made commitments up to the equivalent of approximately EUR 8.5 million in food aid."
"This is not a negligible amount, and we are attempting to measure out this aid to suit the local capacity to absorb it."
"The priority that we give to aid for East Timor will be clearly expressed, and I believe that this complies with your suggestion, Mrs Maij-Weggen, by the visit which Commissioner Nielson is going to be making at the end of the month to both East and West Timor."
"The Commission will be represented on the spot, at the end of the month, by the Commissioner responsible."
"According to our information, the United Nations is managing the large-scale operations in East Timor efficiently."
"The repatriation of displaced persons is in progress."
"As of the day before yesterday, approximately 65,000 of all the persons displaced had returned, and the Indonesian Government gave us assurances that the process of voluntary repatriation would be completed within 100 days."
"Subsequently, it shall, of course, be of the utmost important for the East Timorese themselves to participate in all aspects of the process of redevelopment and development."
"As you have pointed out, in addition to establishing the foundations of the economy, the emergence of a political power that is up to the task and the development of the necessary institutions will be key elements."
"After independence, the government will have to determine its foreign policy stance, particularly as regards membership, if appropriate, of the Lomé Convention."
"This is the information I wished to give you in response to your questions."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m. today."
"Mr President, Commissioner Lamy has not responded yet to what happened to the resolution we submitted in early October regarding the area north of Timor."
"There were a few questions regarding this area too."
"I would like to know when we will receive a reaction because people are in fact waiting for this."
"The situation there is not as serious as it is in Timor but it is getting increasingly worse."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, you have been a Member of this House for a long time."
"You know the Rules."
"We have a very strict period of time for urgencies."
"It is not a Question Time, it is a debate."
"The Commissioner can choose to reply to those parts of the debate he wishes to reply to."
"I am sure that in private he would be happy to give you an answer to your question."
"Human Rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on 18 motions for resolution on human rights:"
"Moratorium on capital punishment - (B5-0272/1999) by Ms Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the creation of a universal moratorium on Capital punishment;"

"(B5-0302/1999) by Mr Oostlander, Mr Posselt, Cushnahan, Grossetête, Lechner, on behalf of the PPE/DE Group, on the forthcoming trial of Alexander Nikitin."
"Moratorium on capital punishment"
"Mr President, I would like to tell you briefly that I belong to a generation which was fortunate not to live through the massacre of Algerians in Paris in 1961, not to experience, on 9 November 1938, Kristallnacht or the start of Jewish persecution in various European countries and fortunate, above, all to see the end of apartheid in South Africa."
"If, at every stage along the way, there are people who rose up and said, ""Never again"" , it is quite simply because they are convinced that there is nothing worse than physical harm inflicted on individuals."
"This founding principle of Europe is today being challenged, indeed, by the application of the death penalty in a considerable number of places throughout the world."
"China, the self-styled democratic Republic of the Congo, the United States and Iran have the sad record of coming at the top of the list of the countries which apply the death sentence."
"According to Amnesty International, there are 3,500 prisoners waiting for execution in the United States, where 68 prisoners were executed last year."
"In these countries, the right of life or death over prisoners is all the more intolerable in the light of the ridiculously limited budgets allocated to crime prevention policies and social matters."
"I prefer to think that, as Victor Hugo said, to close one prison, it is enough to open one more school."
"There is absolutely no doubt that the seventeen years that Mumia Abu-Jamal has just spent rotting on death row following a travesty of justice are linked to the fact that he is black, to his fight against institutional racism, to the freedom of thought which this journalist practised by having the courage to denounce the corruption prevailing in the ranks of the Philadelphia police."
"In the same way, Iran, which executed 66 people last year, would have us believe that the dozens of students arrested and the 13 Jews, were spies."
"The mobilisation of international opinion, as we have seen, prevented the execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, scheduled for 2 December."
"But, for the time being, there has only been a stay of execution."
"We must now seek to have the order of execution revoked definitively."
"We must widen and intensify our pressure on these countries and hit them where it hurts."
"It is important that European businesses should refuse to invest in the states of the United States or anywhere else in the world where the death penalty continues to be applied."
"The Member States of the European Union must refuse to extradite any person to a country where it is known that their death sentence is automatically programmed as soon as they set foot there."
"Demanding the immediate and unconditional abolition of capital punishment throughout the entire world today does not just mean promoting human dignity but also validating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Mr President, I belong to a generation which thinks that conventions against torture and discrimination should not be signed just for the fun of it."
"Mr President, the events that led up to the withdrawal of the motion on the moratorium are described and evaluated, in the resolution we are preparing to vote on, in a fairly neutral and rather polite way."
"I am afraid that the reasons behind the withdrawal of this resolution are, at the very least, suspect, and have more to do with a kind of boycott than the defence of principles."
"I truly hope that Parliament will be attentive to this subject, because it is clear that the attitude of some of the Member States has been ambiguous, to say the least, and it is therefore logical that Parliament - which from this point of view has always been quite consistent - must continue to be vigilant."
"As the Group of the Greens, we have taken note of these events, as well as the somewhat half-hearted wording of this resolution, which, however, we consider it important to adopt, at least in order to indicate that there is a problem that we must continue to be active on."
"Nevertheless, I would stress once again that, from this point of view, the European Union' s ambiguity is apparent to everyone, and I therefore think that we should express ourselves in a much clearer way than we have in the resolution."
"Mr President, we are always complaining and regretting - rightly in my opinion - that the European Union does not speak with one voice on the international stage."
"Despite what our colleague has just said, I think that on this occasion there is more than sufficient reason to congratulate ourselves on the fact that the European Union has unanimously presented a resolution to the United Nations requesting a moratorium on the death penalty."
"It is sad that this initiative has not come to fruition and we hope that it will do so during this legislature."
"What I would like to say, Mr President, is that we have done this because we are convinced that everybody has the unalienable right to the respect for life and this right cannot go unrecognised or be violated."
"We have all seen the horrendous pictures of the last death sentence passed by the Florida Court and it will therefore not surprise any of you that the first person to appear in the text of the joint resolution should be the Spanish - and hence European Union - citizen, Joaquín José Martínez, whose sentence we ask to be reviewed and whose death sentence we ask to be suspended."
"In this case there has been a series of coincidences which have inspired an enthusiastic solidarity movement in our country in which the Government, all the political parties and the rest of society have taken part."
"I would like to say that there have been a whole series of irregularities in the trial and it appears that the defence lawyer has not fulfilled his commitments."
"However, Mr President, what is serious - and his case is serious enough as it is - are not the conditions of this trial, nor the fact that the United States holds the tragic and regrettable record for executing people who are later proved to be innocent."
"What is most tragic and regrettable is the fact that the death penalty exists at all."
"I therefore believe, Mr President, that as a European Parliament we have to show, in this and all other similar cases, a firm and resolute commitment to the right to life, as we have done in this joint resolution."
"Mr President, the death penalty is in fact a repugnant relic of a vanished age."
"It is founded upon an Old Testament ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"" mindset which is not worthy of humanity now that we are approaching a new millennium."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has played a forceful role in the fight against the death penalty."
"In one after another of the applicant States, it is either in the process of being, or already has been, abolished, which is a very positive development."
"In spite of that, the death penalty is still applied in all too many States."
"Only last year, 1,625 prisoners in 37 different countries were executed, and there are thousands on death row."
"In the United States alone, several thousand people are waiting to be executed."
"Some of the prisoners condemned to death throughout the world have committed odious crimes, but that does not justify their being executed."
"All too often, the death penalty is used for political purposes, and there can be legal confusion and innocent people can be executed."
"That alone is an argument against this barbaric form of punishment."
"Nor does the death penalty have any proven deterrent effect."
"The resolution we are debating is really quite remarkable."
"It names three citizens who, over the next few days, are to be executed in the United States."
"Obviously, we are urging the American government not to carry out these death sentences. But what the resolution really ought to be concerned with - a subject which my colleagues too have taken up - is the memorandum concerning the death penalty throughout the world."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wholeheartedly supports this memorandum, which the UN has initiated."
"We would encourage the Commission and the Council to pursue this issue vigorously and to unite the European Union in unanimously condemning the death penalty in every forum so as to give rise to a worldwide moratorium on its use."
"The abolition of the death penalty would be a fantastic step forward in the fight for human rights and also a big step forward for the recognition of human dignity."
"Mr President, every year hundreds of human beings are executed in the world - often in the so-called civilised world - at the hands of other human beings."
"In 1998 it was noted that there were at least 1,625 executions in 37 countries and almost 4,000 death sentences in another 78 countries."
"These figures refer exclusively to the information which Amnesty International has been able to collect."
"The true figure is, without doubt, much higher."
"Every year an unknown number of people are declared innocent after being executed."
"According to a report released recently, since 1973 and in the United States alone, 75 prisoners condemned to death were released when it was discovered that they had been wrongly convicted."
"We will never know how many innocent people there were amongst the approximately 7000 prisoners executed in the United States of America during this century."
"According to Amnesty International, for every six prisoners executed since the restoration of the death penalty in the United States, one innocent person was condemned to death and later pardoned."
"Therefore, it seems to me that the Council' s proposal to the United Nations, however important and positive the initiative may be, is very timid because calls on those States which retain the death penalty - and I quote - ""to progressively restrict the number of crimes for which it is imposed"" ."
"Does that seem to us to be sufficient?"
"Do we want to be a diplomatic Assembly or a political Parliament?"
"That is why we ask the Council, in section 9 of this resolution, in the negotiations with third countries, to examine the possibility of incorporating the abolition of the death penalty into the clause on human rights."
"Perhaps the Council is not in a position to do any more, but what about us?"
"Should we not be more demanding? Should we not be more ambitious?"
"The answer is yes."
"This is why we are sending this message to the Council and all the nations of the world."
"The case of the Spanish citizen, José Joaquín Martínez, is a clear example of justice with no guarantees."
"That is why he is calling for real justice, and that is why we support him today."
"He wants a new form of justice so that he can demonstrate his innocence, and he has the right to it."
"But I declare, we all declare together, that no death sentence is a just sentence."
"None is."
"I will also end with a biblical quote which is more positive than the one quoted by my colleague."
"It is a quote from Genesis."
"Cain killed Abel and nobody disputed his guilt in this horrendous crime."
"He spilled the blood of his brother and the Lord cursed him and expelled him from his house and condemned him to live as a fugitive and a vagabond: ""And Cain said to the Lord: 'every one that findeth me shall slay me' ."
"And the Lord said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold' ."
"And the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him"" ."
"May nobody touch Cain, that was the message."
"May nobody touch Cain."
"That should be our ambition: that nobody can execute any human being ever, in any part of the world, for any reason."
"Nobody."
"Not even the United States of America."
"Mr President, we probably do not always feel comfortable in this Parliament, because what is approved is not what we wanted to be approved."
"However, once again, this Parliament is going to speak to the rest of the world against the death penalty."
"I therefore feel proud to be here this afternoon and to be able to vote, unanimously, for a condemnation of the death penalty."
"The death penalty is barbarous."
"As other Members have said, it is a terrifying fact that many innocent people have been executed."
"And I do not understand how anybody can live with that on their conscience."
"In reality today' s resolution talks about three specific cases: firstly, the case of José Joaquín Martínez, a Spaniard, in whose trial enormous irregularities have occurred."
"I have here a copy of a letter which one of the witnesses sent."
"He is in prison, it is true, but he sent a letter to the court saying that he had heard somebody claiming responsibility for the murder which José Joaquín Martínez is convicted of."
"With this simple source of doubt, it is impossible to condemn a defendant to death."
"Therefore we ask in the resolution for a new trial and that under no circumstances the death sentence be passed."
"The second case is that of Abu Jamal."
"There are many reasons to believe that the trial and death sentence on Abu Jamal were motivated by political factors, above all, because he was a leader."
"For the moment he has been spared."
"His execution was set for 2 December."
"We also demand that this death sentence not be carried out."
"And we also take up the case of a person who is mentally ill, who was about to be executed and who has been spared."
"It seems to us an enormous and terrifying cruelty that anybody should consider executing ill people of this type and that people should be kept in prison for 21 years, as is the case with a Canadian who was due to be executed and, half an hour before his execution, had his appeal accepted in court."
"This is tremendously cruel and the world cannot accept it."
"This Parliament must champion the demand for a universal moratorium, if this is not approved now."
"And to this end we must display our moral authority."
"Mr President, I am in complete agreement with Mrs Díez González on the need to seek to convince the Council to introduce a clause on capital punishment and the abolition of capital punishment into agreements with third countries."
"But, no doubt, it would also be necessary to seek to convince the members of the Socialist Group that they should be firm on this point."
"This has not been the case to date, and I therefore wish Mrs Díez González good luck."
"Having said that, I think that the heart of the matter was raised by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Salafranca."
"What we are talking about here is not the issue of capital punishment."
"This House has shown on many occasions that it was convinced of the need to establish a universal moratorium."
"What we are talking about here is foreign policy and, more exactly, once again, the matter of the European Union' s lack of foreign policy."
"I would go further than Mrs Frassoni."
"There is no ambiguity."
"On Monday, the Council decided to withdraw the motion it had proposed on the pretext that it reiterated a fundamental article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"On Tuesday, it voted in the texts with the same reference to the fundamental articles of this declaration."
"The problem clearly, therefore, lies in the lack of political will, and we can imagine the reasons for this: pressure from some major countries, such as the People' s Republic of China, the United States and Japan, who succeeded in ensuring that this policy, upon which the Union had already decided, was literally betrayed at the last moment."
"The central problem before us, then, as a Parliament, is the problem of a necessary joint European policy on security and foreign affairs."
"One of the first things to ask for is that this dossier is handed over to Mr Solana."
"It is no longer possible for this dossier to be placed in the hands of presidencies which, as we know, change over every six months; we need a permanent spokesman who can, on his own authority, organise the work of the various Member State delegations in New York so that, next year, we have a position which is consistent from beginning to end, thus avoiding this truly tragic situation, one that has made things difficult for a number of third countries friendly to the European Union, starting with Mexico, which had made a very firm commitment to defending our perfectly acceptable compromise position."
"We must therefore amend today' s motion for a resolution in order to firmly condemn the Council and ask it, as firmly, to entrust this dossier to Mr Solana, and to him alone."
"Mr President, Parliament has today, for the umpteenth time, expressed its repugnance of the anachronistic, anti-democratic methods of punishment of dubious efficacy which continue to be used throughout the world, including by countries such as the United States of America, which have recently starting championing human rights."
"However, even underage children are executed in the USA and, according to statistics, the criminal justice system operates selectively at the expense of the weakest economic and social groups, especially if they are dark-skinned."
"We are horrified by the frequency with which the innocence of citizens condemned to death is subsequently proven."
"And while all this is going on, the 54th General Assembly of the UN has rejected the motion by the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union for no more death penalties to be carried out."
"It goes without saying, Mr President, that the death penalty has no place in a democratic society."
"No-one has the power of life or death over anyone for any reason whatsoever."
"On the contrary, the death penalty is the preferred weapon of totalitarian regimes because it is a symbol of the power of the state and of the humility of the individual in the face of the power of the state and, as we know, it is often used to annihilate opponents."
"This is why, on the basis of our European values and in the name of respect for human rights, we call on the governments of all the countries in which death sentences are pending to suspend them immediately and to repeal the death penalty."
"We also call on the USA to allow a retrial of the journalist Abu Jamal in Pennsylvania, of Martínez in Florida and of Robinson so that they may have a chance to defend themselves properly."
"Finally, the European Union and the Council need to impose the repeal of the death penalty in the form of a special clause in economic and political agreements with third countries, as called for by other Members. In addition, an immediate worldwide campaign is needed and a worldwide moratorium on capital punishment pending the final repeal of the death penalty throughout the whole world."
"I shall vote in favour of the resolution asking for a moratorium on capital punishment, since it is the best on offer, but I consider that not having the courage to take up a stance in favour of the immediate and unconditional abolition of capital punishment is an abdication of responsibility in the face of barbarism."
"Among the many cases of death sentences where the sentence is so unfair that carrying out the sentence would be a heinous act, I wish to draw attention to the case of the Iranian students condemned to death for taking part in the demonstrations last July."
"These sentences come in addition to the equally ignominious sentences of 13 Iranian Jews, not to mention here the thousands of victims of repression in the past."
"All those under threat of capital punishment for political reasons should be released immediately, as should the great numbers of students sentenced to imprisonment."
"And if these sentences show the worth of the regime of oppression and terror which is that of Iran, they are just as indicative of the essence and worth of trusts such as Shell, for example, which has just signed a USD 800 million contract with the Iranian Government."
"It also shows the worth of the pronouncements on human rights by Europe' s Heads of State and Government who received the President of Iran with great pomp and ceremony, so that other trusts could sign other just as fat contracts."
"Finally, while I am delighted to see that Mumia Abu-Jamal, the victim of the schemes of a corrupt and racist police force, was not executed, I consider that the fight is not yet over, and it is his release that we have to achieve."
"Respect for Serbs and other minority groups in Kosovo"
"Mr President, what has happened in recent years in Kosovo is a profound tragedy."
"On many occasions, we have condemned from this Chamber the outrages perpetrated upon the Kosovan Albanian people."
"Their suffering is inconceivable, and none of us can ever understand the scale of what they have experienced."
"We in the European Union are also guilty of not having succeeded in time in preventing Milosevic' s insane excursions so close to our own territory."
"The EU also has an important role to play in the reconstruction process."
"All democratic forces must be supported in order to facilitate the reconstruction and create a functioning and democratic civil society."
"The collective rape which has been committed against the Kosovan Albanian people cannot however justify the actions which have been reported on against civilians belonging to, among other groups, the Serbian minority, but also other minorities."
"If any kind of normality is to be achieved, all affected parties must feel secure in returning or in staying where they are."
"This applies to both the majority and the minority."
"The persecutions, and in certain cases murders, of Serbs which have occurred are therefore entirely to be condemned and must cease."
"They do not carry the peace process forward."
"The outrages committed against KFOR personnel are also unacceptable and, on behalf of my Group (the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party), I should like strongly to condemn these."
"I should also like to appeal to all parties to cease committing such outrages and to lay down their weapons and together embark upon the long and difficult road to peace. I plead for all parties and organisations to work together for a better and brighter future in Kosovo, a future where all can hopefully live together."
"Mr President, it is an insult to our conscience and political ethics that, after the military intervention by NATO and the European Union against Yugoslavia, under a humanitarian flag, as a result of the unforgivable ethnic cleansing by Yugoslavia against the Albanians, we are now remaining calm and accepting the violence against the Serbs, gypsies and other minorities, this time on the part of the Albanians, which, furthermore, is of an even higher proportion."
"Therefore, we think that, if the European Union does not condemn and put an end to this criminal behaviour, the conclusions would be clear: firstly, the European Union would become an accomplice in the killings of Serbs and gypsies organised by the criminal and mafia groups of the KLA; and secondly, it would demonstrate that the West has two different yardsticks; and thirdly, the impression would be given that the objective of the intervention was to destroy the Serbian people."
"Mr President, at the beginning of this year, anyone who was no longer able to stand by and watch the murders, expulsions, looting and pillaging by the Serbian army and militia in Kosovo and for that reason spoke out in favour of so-called humanitarian intervention, must now wonder whether the war - that was unfortunately not waged against those who committed the crimes, but against the Yugoslavian population, - the war that we conducted for over two and a half months and that cost several billion euros, really brought about the result that we expected."
"Have the murders, expulsions, looting and pillaging in Kosovo stopped?"
"Unfortunately not."
"Unfortunately the crimes are continuing, with two differences."
"First: the victims of the crimes are no longer the Kosovo Albanians, but Serbs, Roma and even Bosnians."
"Secondly, it is no longer the Yugoslavian army in Kosovo, but our armies, which on the one hand are completing a fantastic undertaking in reconstruction, in protecting people, bringing law and order, in every respect and on the other hand are despairing because they are not able to really protect the people that they should protect and that they would have wanted to protect."
"Who is to blame?"
"Unfortunately those for whom the international community waged a war, the first war on humanitarian grounds."
"The former KLA - I say ""former"" because it supposedly no longer exists, because it was supposedly disarmed - believes that it has won a war and that it therefore has the right to commit exactly the same crimes as those who led to this war."
"And that is the disgrace!"
"The international community has until now just looked on at what is happening."
"We would assure the UN representative, Mr Kouchner, and his former colleagues, of our full support, if he would finally begin to set up an administration in Kosovo and not leave that to the bogus and illegitimate government of the KLA, even if the local authorities and the city and local councils were not formed by the KLA, but actually - if not other Kosovans - other UN officials could complete this work and the various different tasks that need to be performed in Kosovo."
"Mr President, Mr Sakellariou, I can immediately endorse what you have said."
"I was there in October."
"I can confirm that the military power could not resolve the problems on the spot."
"On the contrary, the old principle is being borne out: violence breeds violence."
"The international community in fact has no solution to the Kosovo conflict that exists just as it did before."
"The conflict is there as it was previously."
"The international community does say that Kosovo is part of the rest of Yugoslavia and we are creating a multi-ethnic society."
"But the reality in Kosovo is completely different."
"Everyone who is there and everyone who works there knows that, and that includes the EU officials."
"The former KLA, Mr Sakellariou, I can stress, feels that it is the victor and, through the mainly economic international aid, feels that this victory is confirmed."
"All the parties theoretically declare that the Serbs, Roma and Albanians can live together but in practice the situation in Pristina is different."
"You can no longer see the Cyrillic alphabet."
"It has all been destroyed, because the Slav language may no longer be spoken."
"For all Serbs who live in Pristina this means that they can really no longer take part in public life."
"This is Pristina, a city full of international organisations!"
"In Mítrovica the situation is much worse."
"The city is completely divided and is becoming more markedly so day by day."
"Why is that?"
"The reason is simply that we only concentrate on economic aid and forget the crucial things, that is to say, the practise of tolerance, the practise of democracy and aid in the social field."
"There is no money available for these things on the spot."
"Mr Kouchner knows that reconstruction in Kosovo will fail on the very matter of the protection of the minorities."
"He is not receiving any help from the EU in that regard."
"Mr President, the situation in Kosovo is marked by great uncertainty and violence and even by murder from time to time and in the end, as we have heard, that discredits us all."
"In many cases in which I have tried to help since 1989, I have felt myself to be personally compromised."
"Why did we intervene as an international community?"
"We decided to help the Albanians because their basic and human rights were being infringed."
"For that reason we went in and I still believe that it was the right thing to do."
"Over eight years of an apartheid regime in Kosovo the Albanians did not do anything to anyone, neither to the Serbs nor to the Roma, nor to the Croats, nor to the Bosnians."
"But they have suffered dreadfully and we must not forget that."
"The mass graves, more of which are found every day, are proof of this."
"I therefore believe that it will be very difficult for them to live together."
"Wounds heal extremely slowly."
"We in Central and Northern Europe know that too."
"I therefore believe that we must demand something, that they can contribute and that is, coexistence on the ground."
"And we must help them. These criminal acts must also be denounced by the Albanian leaders."
"We must help with the means at our disposal to find the perpetrators and convict them."
"We want to prevent injustice and now some of those we have helped are turning out to be liars and are themselves driving out minorities."
"The Roma, Serbs, Croats and Bosnians, anyone in fact who might not speak this language, belongs to this group."
"I should not like the oppressed people to become oppressors themselves."
"We must therefore ensure that in the communities where there is persecution, even the reconstruction be suspended, so that every single citizen in this country takes responsibility himself and ensures that such criminal acts do not occur again."
"KFOR cannot be everywhere, it cannot stand behind everyone and so every decent Albanian - and there are more of them than we think - really must feel that they themselves are taking responsibility."
"The problem is also that the Albanian leaders or those people who think they are, are not really in a position jointly to build the future for this land, for their homeland, and so we must also appeal to them."
"I believe that we need an interim government - and more quickly than Mr Kouchner is able to establish one."
"Secondly, at local level, we need really responsible people and if these people cannot be Albanians or Serbs where they are in the majority, then it must be someone from the international community so that we have a contact to talk to."
"Everywhere, where things are going well in the communities, we must react positively and say that we are helping you more than we help those who do nothing."
"Now - this is of course a difficult task which must be carried out by UNMIG - the problem is that this is something that is easier to solve on paper than in reality."
"But I am not of the opinion that we can do all of that merely by installing democracy."
"We must do that, but the first need is to create jobs, we must create infrastructure, so that the young people who are now going around with Kalashnikovs, can finally hold tools in their hands and do something for their country."
"Then we shall be on the right path and Mr Kouchner must also be a little more effective than he is at the moment, whoever may be hampering him in carrying out his task."
"Mr President, today' s debate has until now unfortunately been really one-sided as we have forgotten to be self-critical."
"We have for years ignored the oppression that went on for 10 years in Kosovo."
"Doris Pack and others did not do so, but a large majority did."
"We are ourselves to blame, at least those who held this attitude, for the fact that Rugova was frozen out, because he was left alone for 10 years with his non-violence."
"It is quite clear that in a desperate situation, in which hundreds of thousands of people were driven out by systematic state violence - and that is the big difference with the current isolated acts of revenge that are of course despicable - Rugova lost control of the forces."
"We should for a start see clearly that condemning others can be a good thing, but it would also be a good thing to exercise some self-criticism: We have above all failed in this way."
"Of course we must send out a strong signal against any expulsions."
"I myself come from a family who - collectively innocent - on the basis of state decrees 50 years ago, were expelled."
"Any expulsion is an expulsion too many and this 20th century is likely to go down in history as the century of genocide and expulsions."
"We therefore have a duty to stop every expulsion, including those in Kosovo, and we have a duty to speak up so that the ban on expulsions and the right to a homeland become the foundations of international law, so that such dreadful events are not repeated."
"Mr President, the fact is, and I can only endorse what my colleagues have just said, that we are running a considerable risk of missing the goal and failing to create a multi-ethnic Kosovo, which was our goal, and of creating a ethnically pure Kosovo, i.e. a purely Albanian Kosovo just before we reach that goal."
"Mr Posselt, you are right in your criticism."
"In this very House, Mrs Pack and many others including myself have for years pointed out what could happen in Kosovo if we continue to look on and thereby contribute to Rugova being frozen out."
"When we were in Kosovo a short while ago - the President of this House and Mrs Pack -, we saw that where ""ethnic cleansing"" occurred, the situation is going fairly well."
"But where the ethnic groups meet, the conflicts are very acute and they have become more acute."
"It is unacceptable that if Serbs or Albanians need to go to hospital, they actually run a risk of being more injured once they get there than they would have been before they got to hospital."
"The language of the international community must be clear here."
"It is unacceptable that every Albanian who has a liberal, open attitude, like the former speaker of the delegation at Rambouillet, is threatened because he speaks out in favour of the Serbs, the Roma, the Sinti and other ethnic groups being accepted in his country."
"As was already mentioned, it also has to do with the fact that we unfortunately have Albanian politicians in Kosovo who do not conduct policy that is geared to the future structure, but are working in a one-sided way according to which side they are on."
"It was the speaker of the delegation in Rambouillet who made a great impression on us when he said: ""Ask an Albanian politician any minor date, any minor event in history and he will tell you a lot about it."
"If you ask him how the social security system of the future will be extended, you will not find anyone who can give you an answer"" ."
"So it is all the more important - and I should like to stress this - that UNMIK and Bernard Kouchner make rapid progress in setting up a government."
"The government must of course have contact with the population."
"It must work together with the population."
"But it must also examine very carefully who it is and then it must become clear and unambiguous that it is the UN that is also at stake along with its mandate and its authority and of course the European Union as well."
"We must help the Albanian population to build a multi-ethnic society."
"That is the great task before us."
"The battle for freedom in Kosovo has not yet been won."
"There is still a lot to do!"
"It is most gratifying to note that all the Groups in this House are clearly in agreement on this subject."
"That is certainly a great help."
"Mr President, on 23 November, Alexander Nikitin will appear in court again."
"He still has to face trial on an old case of ""spying"" ."
"It became clear a long time ago that he has the information in the Bellona report from sources that are accessible to the general public."
"However, his expert knowledge made it possible for us to be made aware of an enormous hazard that is heading for us and is slumbering in the Arctic Ocean."
"He acted with a great sense of humanity."
"The EU has a special responsibility here because until now it has used the material that Alexander Nikitin compiled."
"One of the essential components of the Northern dimension that was decided on in Helsinki is the issue of cleaning the Arctic Ocean and averting the danger that could affect us all."
"We must therefore intervene more forcefully here so that Alexander Nikitin can finally be released and so that the accusations are dropped, because we all know that these proceedings are purely political and therefore the laws in Russia will also be infringed by these proceedings, because the old nomenclature will win again."
"I believe that Alexander Nikitin has acted with enormous consideration for others and with remarkable responsibility in making this material available to us."
"It is therefore necessary for the EU Mission in Moscow at least to observe this case, but also to intervene in the political dialogue, so that it is declared a political case and Alexander Nikitin can finally be released."
"Alexander Nikitin should be free and honoured!"
"Mr President, the European Convention on Human Rights that also applies to Russia as a Member State of the Council of Europe, has, as it were, its headquarters here in Strasbourg."
"On the other side of the river is the European Court of Human Rights, to which Mr Nikitin has appealed."
"That means that what is happening in Russia is not an internal affair of a far-off land but that it is an internal affair of a European institution at whose heart are the fifteen Member States of the EU."
"We therefore have an important duty to speak up for Mr Nikitin and his release so that he can finally live in humane and constitutional conditions."
"We, as the EU, are also bound under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which not only commits Russia but ourselves too and it contains a human rights clause, to speak out most fervently on behalf of Mr Nikitin for an improvement in his conditions of detention on the spot, for his release and as I said, for fair and constitutional treatment."
"It would be a disgrace if we gave way, because - as Mrs Schroedter put it so well - Mr Nikitin also acted in our interests."
"We have often dealt with it here in the Parliament."
"He acted on behalf of the European environment."
"He acted for the rule of law on the whole continent."
"We should in fact award Mr Nikitin one of our prizes here in the European Parliament."
"I should therefore like to endorse this motion for a resolution most emphatically and the appeal it contains."
"Mr President, I rise on behalf of my group but also on behalf of my colleague Lord Bethell, who takes a particular concern and interest in this matter."
"The fate of Alexander Nikitin is particularly relevant to a topical and urgent debate."
"Next Tuesday he is due to appear in court in Russia."
"I believe this is the sixth time that he will appear in court."
"He is indicted on a charge of high treason, which is a very strong and extreme charge and for what?"
"For addressing a matter of public interest, of environmental interest to the whole of Europe."
"Under this charge he faces a possible death sentence."
"This is an extreme sanction and this House and the European institutions should send a very powerful message to Russia that it should re-think this issue, the charges should be dropped and it should respect our call for his immediate release."
"In the context of the earlier debate on ending the death penalty, it is very relevant that we should call upon the Russian authorities to respect our views, the views of Europe, as to whether he should be indicted and what the sanction should be."
"So I very much support the calls for Mr Nikitin to be immediately released and found not guilty of the charges."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30.p.m."
"Rwanda/Burundi"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0267/99 by Mrs Ries and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0276/99 by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0285/99 by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE (Social Democratic) Group;"
"B5-0293/99 by Mrs Maes and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group;"
"B5-0294/99 by Mrs Maes and others, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group;"
"B5-0300/99 by Mr Van Hecke and Mr Khanbhai, on behalf of the PPE (Christian Democrats)/DE Group;"
"B5-0301/99 by Mr Van Hecke and Mr Khanbhai, on behalf of the PPE (Christian Democrats)/DE Group;"
"on the situation in the Great Lakes region and in particular on Rwanda and the situation in Burundi."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the recent release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has scandalised the government and population in Rwanda."
"Their anger is perfectly legitimate: the defendant was released on a technicality despite the extremely serious charges against him, charges of genocide."
"Going beyond this particular episode which the Rwandans see as traumatic, what is involved here is the culture of impunity."
"It must be clearly established that all those who committed crimes as heinous as genocide or crimes against humanity, or who were accomplices to these, will be pursued tirelessly."
"In order to do so, international institutions, and that includes ourselves, must provide the international courts with sufficient resources to accomplish its task."
"Would the European Union be prepared, Mr Lamy, to play a role in this regard, in order to, in future, prevent this type of blunder which is catastrophic in the opinion of the populations who are waiting for truth and justice?"
"Finally, being particularly attentive, of course, to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, so that the duty to remember this conflict which already seems far off, some people think too far off, is maintained, it is the role of the European Union, I feel, to stand by the people of Rwanda on this occasion."
"A people that has today been truly betrayed by the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, who was, need one be reminded, the founder of hate radio, the notorious Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM)."
"The reaction of the Kigali authorities is understandable, but I invite them to resume their cooperation with the ICTR which is still, in spite of everything, the best instrument to establish justice and, hence, peace."
"It is essential for the international justice system to regain control if it wishes to ensure its own credibility, but we must also give it the resources it needs to fulfil its ambitions."
"This is the price of what we owe to the memory of the Rwandans."
"Mr President, once again we are called upon to discuss the situation in Rwanda."
"Yesterday we were deploring genocide and violations of human rights."
"Today, indeed, we can only be outraged at the release of Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, supposedly for technical reasons, even though he was one of the most significant parties in the incitement to genocide."
"His release, indeed, is quite symptomatic of the lack of will to make an evaluation of the genocide and, more especially, of the wish to hush up the involvement of European countries, particularly France, where a recent parliamentary inquiry revealed complicity that was, at the best, passive."
"Let us also stress that the Rwandan situation, as worrying as it is, more particularly affects the stability of neighbouring countries, and the situation in the Congo is quite tragic from this point of view."
"It is essential today for the European Parliament to assert clearly that, in order to ensure stability in this region, the conditions must be created for a peace which is based on justice and the prosecution of those responsible for ethnic violence."
"This is why we are asking the ICTR to review its position regarding Mr Barayagwiza' s release, in consideration of the seriousness of the charges against him. Without some action of this sort, the populations of Rwanda are likely to feel they have been wronged and ethnic conflict is likely to start up again with renewed vigour."
"We also ask the Rwandan government to resume its relations with the ICTR."
"This is why it is essential to put an end to the conditions of impunity which are prevailing in these countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to subscribe to what the previous speakers have said and at the same time express my indignation at and disappointment with our own attitude."
"We wait until a white person is murdered before we take renewed interest in a conflict in Burundi that has taken so many thousands of people into their graves."
"I would also like to mention the camps which, in Dutch, we refer to as ""hergroepingskampen"" (regrouping camps)."
"This term stands for concentration camps, this is what they really are."
"In these camps, they section people off based on their ethnic origin so as to facilitate covert genocide."
"I would therefore urge that the European Union take the situation in Rwanda, Burundi and Congo a great deal more seriously."
"This week, I heard the advisor of the Council, the High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, and I hope that we will be able, at some stage, to help create for others the stability that we want for ourselves."
"Mr President, Burundi, as has been stated earlier, is on the brink of another catastrophe."
"Rebel attacks, army cleansing, hundreds of thousands of refugees falling prey to starvation and disease and an economy which is ruined beyond repair."
"Some even claim that the situation is comparable to that in Rwanda just before the genocide in 1994."
"Despite this, Europe is adopting a back-seat approach again."
"Because the Member States apparently cannot agree on how to tackle the crisis in the Great Lakes Region, we leave Burundi to African countries, some of which are involved in the crisis."
"We link our aid to the Arusha peace process where Tanzania acts as mediator but at the same time condone the fact that rebels carry out attacks on Burundi from the same country."
"We refuse to cooperate for fundamental reasons with a government that has managed nonetheless to acquire Parliament' s support."
"The question is very much whether, in this way, we are not playing into the hands of the extremists, both amongst the rebels and within the army."
"Do we want Hutu extremist movements to seize power in Burundi and commit renewed genocide on a minority?"
"Or are we waiting for a new coup and Tutsi extremists from the army to start renewed cleansing?"
"If we do not want this, let us then give our full support to the peace process in Burundi."
"Let us bring the moderate parties round the table and isolate the extremists."
"Let us give unconditional aid to the population and kick-start the economy."
"Let us finally take Burundi' s problem seriously."
"In any case, we will never be able to say: we did not know."
"Mr President, of the great number of problems affecting Rwanda and Burundi I should like on behalf of my Group to speak about the latest events, that is say, what took place on 6 November, i.e. a few days ago, when the Rwanda government announced that it would refuse further cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha."
"We took some pride in the fact that this Tribunal was set up at all - with our assistance too - whether it was adequate is a more complicated matter - in order to clear up these inhuman crimes and to punish the respective perpetrators."
"As an initial reaction, this attitude of the Rwandan government is even understandable, but the conclusion that it drew from it, i.e. now to refuse further cooperation with this Tribunal, is entirely the wrong one."
"We cannot understand - and I express myself carefully here - that the presumed architect of the genocide, Barayagwiza, on the basis of procedural issues - and this is hard to swallow - was released and not brought before the court at all."
"He was, after all, the political director in the foreign ministry of a regime that was responsible for the deaths of 800 000 people - we should really say for the slaughter of 800 000 people."
"This person, who has now been released, was a leading official in the state radio at the very time when the radio was urging and inciting people on to racial hatred."
"Our Group has a two-fold demand: on the one hand to the Rwanda government, to cancel its decision and on the other hand to the Tribunal to revise this decision."
"In particular, it is not acceptable that the Tribunal refer to the fact that a further charge in the same case is inadmissible owing to the ""not guilty"" verdict."
"For charges of this kind there can be no immunity."
"Mr President, I shall take the statements that I must answer in order, first on the subject of Rwanda, then Burundi."
"As far as Rwanda is concerned, the Commission shares the concerns which have been expressed regarding the effectiveness of the system of justice, if I may use this diplomatic term, to judge those responsible for genocide."
"No national reconciliation is possible without proper court procedures, and that involves both the Rwandan national justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda."
"To answer Mrs Ries, regarding the Rwandan national system of justice, the Commission targeted its interventions at institutional support to the government departments in the area of reinforcement of defence rights and civil cases, in the area of improving living standards in prisons and in the area of support for the survivors of genocide, as well as in the area of respect for human rights."
"Nonetheless, there are still 130,000 prisoners in prison, accused of crimes related to genocide, awaiting trial."
"The Rwandan Government is looking for alternative formulae which do not leave room for impunity, and which go in the direction we would like."
"It is working on defining a system of courts of arbitration along the lines of traditional practice, where the courts are made up of citizens elected to the various levels of local administration, and they would be established to judge three categories of defendant: firstly, ordinary murderers, secondly, those who assaulted but did not kill, and thirdly, finally, the looters, leaving the instigators and ideologists of the genocide and massacres to be judged effectively by ordinary courts, which must be organised in some way to be able to take on this task."
"With the other backers, the Commission is currently assessing the opportunities and methods to contribute to the establishment of this system within the framework of our cooperation."
"As far as the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is concerned, the Commission allocated finance from the very creation of this tribunal, totalling EUR 1.5 million to date."
"The Commission is going to initiate an evaluation of human rights programmes in developing countries."
"Particular attention will be paid to the countries or projects we have supported, such as the one I have just mentioned."
"This evaluation will include support for the International Criminal Tribunal and its conclusions will enable us to identify any new support according to the methods we shall assess in the light of this investigation."
"As far as Burundi is concerned, we, too, are extremely concerned at the situation of increasing violence in this country."
"What are we doing in response to this?"
"I know and I can see that it is always ridiculous to cite aid figures in the face of such calamities."
"I nonetheless believe that these are the only real proof we can offer to show what we are doing to act on these concerns of yours."
"The real criticism you might make, which would hit home, is that we are passive in this type of situation."
"I believe we are not being passive in this particular instance."
"I should like to give you some examples of this."
"We have supported the peace process by financing the talks taking place in Arusha, with a contribution of EUR 2 million, which is far from being the largest contribution and which should, along with other external finance, be sufficient for the successful conclusion of these talks."
"It is true that the passing of the facilitator, ex-President Nyerere, is one more obstacle to add to the complexity of the process itself."
"We think that it is essential for the talks to continue while seeking a new facilitator at the same time."
"The intensification of the confrontations, in recent months, has given rise to the displacement of some tens of thousands of people who have, in effect, as has been mentioned in this debate, been forcibly detained in camps by the government since last July."
"We intervened immediately to provide humanitarian aid, with aid of more than EUR one million over three operations, and we are prepared to continue to intervene in order to meet the most urgent needs next year."
"The total ECHO contribution to Burundi reached around EUR 10 million this year."
"At a meeting in New York at the start of the year, the backers of Burundi decided to contribute towards improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable sectors of the population and to target their support at the rehousing of displaced persons."
"In the context of these positions, the Commission approved a redevelopment programme of around EUR 50 million, which may be implemented according to the security conditions in the country."
"We feel that the complete resumption of cooperation is linked to the results of the peace process, and to the establishment of a political and constitutional framework which will lead, finally, to democratisation."
"This is the answer which I wished to give you, Mr President."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30. p.m."
"Pakistan"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolution:"
"B5-0269/99 by Mr Van den Bos and Mrs Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0277/99 by Mr Vinci and Mr Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0278/99 by Mr Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE (Christian Democrats)/DE Group;"
"B5-0286/99 by Mr Schori, on behalf of the PSE (Social Democrats) Group;"
"B5-0296/99 by Mrs Lambert and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Greens/ALE Group"
"on the declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan."
"This resolution sets out the concerns that must be shared by the world-wide community about the deterioration of stability in Pakistan and in its neighbouring territories."
"We are certainly right to regret the military take-over but it would be sensible to recognise that the new military regime is so far extremely popular within Pakistan."
"Pakistan clearly expects General Musharraf to succeed in stopping a long series of corrupt and illiberal factions."
"The Sharif and Bhutto regimes have misruled their country for many years."
"Certainly the military are tackling the financial fraud that exists on a massive scale with vigour."
"This motion speaks wrongly of the need for democracy to be reinstalled or reinstated."
"It should be a calling for progress towards democracy and proposing a practical programme for the European Union that will facilitate that progress."
"Fighting corruption is an essential first step."
"I trust that the Portuguese Presidency will use its renowned skills and experience to develop European Union appreciation of the problems that confront Pakistan and I would welcome Mr Lamy's opinion on the current status of the Cooperation Agreement."
"Mr President, the military coup that took place in Pakistan in October immediately after the army Chief-of-Staff, General Musharraf was stood down is condemned in the strongest possible terms by the PPE/DE Group."
"The constitution was declared to be invalid."
"The national parliament and the provincial parliaments were temporarily suspended."
"Even if the take-over of power by the military occurred without great protests from the population, there is no alternative to a properly functioning democracy brought about by free elections."
"The attempt to prove that the former Prime Minister Mr Sharif had participated in a criminal conspiracy and had built up a system of nepotism, should not become a show trial."
"Any legal proceedings must be fair and transparent to the general public."
"On meeting the EU' s special envoy, Walter Sari, on 2 November, General Musharraf rejected a timetable for the establishment of democracy."
"There is therefore no reason why the EU should be prepared to follow other states, which think that the stability programme that has been announced has a good chance of success."
"The first signs are quite hopeful: the assurance of a climate favourable to investment, tax relief, the thinning out of the bureaucracy and the ending of the personal enrichment of those in charge."
"The national banks must stop the custom of awarding generous loans to officials."
"The new, stricter anti-corruption legislation is a step in the right direction."
"The loss of confidence and flight of capital can only be stopped if democracy is restored and human rights are guaranteed."
"International investment has been suspended until the IMF accepts Pakistan as a full partner."
"We therefore demand that the military government return to constitutional rule."
"Politics must be taken over by a democratic legitimate civil government."
"The suspension of both Commonwealth membership and the European Union Cooperation Agreement can only be reversed when all the conditions for the urgently needed economic, social and humanitarian reforms in Pakistan are met."
"Mr President, our colleagues have already spoken about the military coup."
"I should once again like to emphasise what Mr Duff and Mr Mann have said."
"For decades elected, but altogether corrupt governments and most recently that of Mr Nawaz Sharif, have allowed violations of human rights, slave labour, social disasters and a foreign debt that is out of control to be part of daily life in Pakistan and all this has led to the ruin of the country."
"The same governments supported the fundamentalist murderous regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan and represent a constant incalculable risk to peace in the region because they support and stir up terrorist activity in the border region of Kashmir against their Indian neighbours."
"Despite everything, we should not allow ourselves to consider the military coup as a possible alternative to the incompetence and corruption of an elected government."
"We condemn most strongly the military coup in Pakistan and urge those in power to restore the rule of law and constitutional order immediately by setting up a civil transitional government in accordance with a clear timetable to restore parliamentary legitimacy by holding elections."
"These should be the preconditions to be fulfilled before the Council signs the suspended Cooperation Agreement with Pakistan."
"The EU as a whole must adopt an unambiguous position towards Pakistan, which stresses that for us, democratic principles can neither be negotiable nor the subject of compromises and that any future would-be dictator must prevent such dreadful behaviour."
"I too like many colleagues was interested in the response of many people of Pakistani origin and background to this coup - people who are themselves involved in democratic politics and concerned about good democratic practice."
"They were not appalled."
"So that reaction adds weight to our awareness of much that was wrong under the previous regime, for example the lack of protection for the rights of religious minorities and the increasing abuse of the blasphemy law which was introduced after the military take-over in 1958."
"Under the previous regime we also saw a growing abuse of human rights, of people such as the Sindhi."
"We look at what will be happening to political prisoners under this regime as a clear indicator of its intentions."
"I am also concerned at reports that the military were motivated by the feeling that the Sharif government was not doing enough to protect and maintain the Federation of Pakistan."
"I find that particularly worrying when I remember its developing nuclear capability."
"We believe that the conduct of the trial of the former prime minister will also be a clear sign as to the military's good intentions to return to, or rather not to return but to introduce good democratic government to Pakistan."
"Mr President, as regards Pakistan, as you know, the situation was discussed in the General Affairs Council on 15 November."
"The Union, and I believe this is clear to everyone, is extremely concerned at this coup d' état and fervently hopes for the restoration of democracy in the near future."
"The Council is waiting to see that the assurances given by the interim administration, as it is called, relating to respect for human rights and civil liberties, are respected unconditionally, and that all charges against the deposed Prime Minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, are heard according to proper legal form in a civilian court open to the public."
"As regards the specific points you have raised in the resolutions relating to the Commission' s development aid programmes and projects in Pakistan, it must be stressed that these are directed almost exclusively at the poorest and most disadvantaged levels of the population."
"Many of these projects are implemented by NGOs and are intended to improve the scope and quality of social sector services, particularly in the fields of primary education and health care."
"The commitments for Community projects currently amount to some EUR 180 million in total and the Commission proposes to continue to implement these projects."
"We feel that suspending aid to underprivileged groups would be an inappropriate sanction upon them."
"We are perfectly aware of the deplorable situation of a great many children in Pakistan, especially girls, but we feel that the most effective means of improving this situation is to contribute towards ensuring good quality, accessible, universal primary education."
"We are also participating in a project with the International Labour Organisation for the rehabilitation of children employed in dangerous work in Pakistan."
"Work on the new projects to be financed under next year' s budget has currently been suspended, while waiting for developments in the evaluation of the new situation over there."
"We acknowledge the need to assist the NGOs and civilian sector associations in order to strengthen the democratic institutions of the country, and you doubtless know that the capacity for absorption and the size of the many NGOs in this field in Pakistan are, unfortunately, limited."
"In addition, we have established contact with several NGOs and associations, but we feel that care must be taken not to overload these organisations with funds and assistance, which may not subsequently be managed in the most efficient way possible."
"In order to reply specifically to Mr Duff' s question, following the coup d' état, the Union cancelled the signing of the new cooperation agreement between the Community and Pakistan, and we suspended our political dialogue so as to send a message, loud and clear, to the new masters in Pakistan regarding our concerns about the coup d' état and its consequences."
"I believe I have answered your question specifically, Mr Duff."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Lamy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"We shall now proceed to the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Vote (continuation)"
"I should just like to say that in principle of course I was in favour of this resolution, but that I do feel that something very dangerous has been started here, that is, the systematic abuse of resolutions for an ideological debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We should take this Charter of Fundamental Rights so seriously that we prepare it with a considerable, almost constitutional majority here in the House by consensus and not by half measures in resolutions."
"I believe that this Charter on Fundamental Rights must be discussed carefully and that it should not detach the rights of the child from the parents' rights, the rights of the family and the parents' right to educate their children in the family."
"These are elementary points that must be discussed in depth and not superficially and at top speed."
"- (FR) At this time when we are about to vote on the resolution on the rights of the child, I wish to declare the importance which I attach to this legislation."
"This vote has nothing to do with any others in which I have participated during this session."
"It reminds me of my motive for taking up politics, which may be summed up as follows: to improve, as far as may be possible, the daily lot of human beings!"
"This may seem presumptuous, given the scope of the task, but it is my profound conviction."
"And even though I know that this vote will not radically change the tragic situation of thousands of children here or elsewhere, it does testify to the political will of this Parliament to make progress!"
"Declaring that it is intolerable for children to be forced to go to work instead of to school, for children not to be able to eat their fill, for children to be sold as if they were marketable goods, for children to be the victims of adult physical or moral violence, already represents a great step forward, one which must of course be put into effect in our policies and our daily life!"
"Let us act like responsible men and women (politicians)!"
"The Convention whose anniversary we are celebrating today has made it possible to achieve considerable progress since it places the child at the centre of the debate!"
"Children are human beings; they are people with rights."
"We must respect them, protect them, educate them and love them!"
". The Convention on the Rights of the Child represents the most successful Convention in international law, with signatories in all countries of the world except Somalia and the USA."
"The aims of the Convention account for the unprecedented international reaction: measures to be implemented in international law to protect the rights of the most innocent, most vulnerable of the world's citizens."
"The draft resolution which we have voted today seeks to ensure that the elements enshrined within this convention are protected in other legal bases and frameworks."
"In doing this, we are seeking to be a voice for the voiceless, and protect those who are unable to protect themselves."
"Children must be protected by those who have their interests at heart."
"We must emphasise, therefore, the role of the family in safeguarding children, especially parents."
"The state, in its attempt to provide a legal basis for the protection and treatment of children must bow to the pre-eminent right which parents have in protecting, raising and safeguarding their children."
"We must ensure that the family, to quote the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is 'afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community'."
"Promoting the rights of children is a topic dear to the hearts of all of us here today."
"It is at the same time a great privilege and a grave responsibility to work to create legislation and legal instruments for the protection of children."
"Ensuring the protection of children must go hand in hand with measures which promote and protect the family."
"A strong family unit is essential to ensuring the protection of children."
"The preamble to the Convention states that the child, in order to realise 'the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment'."
"Articles 5, 7, 9, 14, and others enshrine the responsibilities and rights of parents in relation to the raising of their children."
"It is absolutely crucial that parental rights are enshrined and ensured in order to protect the full rights of children."
". I welcome the focus in the House today on the rights of children."
"Children, as the most vulnerable and defenceless members of society need extra rights and extra protection."
"It is a privilege for me to be part of a process that can begin to ensure that this protection is provided."
"The family, as was recognised by the drafters of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is fundamental in protecting and promoting the rights of the child."
"It is in families that children learn the values of 'peace, dignity, tolerance, freedom, equality and solidarity' (preamble), as well as the skills necessary to implement these values in society throughout their lives."
"The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the responsibilities of parents in providing the proper care and attention to their children, as well as the child's right to receive this care, guidance, and love."
"I am happy to support the motion on the floor today which will ensure that these rights are supported - the rights of parents to raise their children, and the rights of children to that protection and support."
"Chechnya"
"Mr President, those of us who represent the Stateless nations of Europe passionately denounce the latest aggression which, at this turn of the century, is being committed by the Russian army in an abusive manner against the small country of Chechnya."
"Russia is causing destruction, and the death of civilians - including old people, women and children - as well as an exodus which exceeds that of Kosovo."
"All of this because a new Rasputin wants to gain popularity in Russia and take power as a new President, and to this end he thinks nothing of seriously endangering democracy, the Rule of Law and the economic reforms of the Russian Federation."
"We cannot accept it and therefore we condemn it outright."
"Mr President, this resolution on Chechnya is the most far-reaching there has ever been at international level and that is a credit to this House, for in the first war too, we contributed decisively to a peace agreement being signed."
"However, I am disappointed that our amendment, which on the basis of the human rights clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of this agreement will be placed on ice in the context of this war, will not be adopted by the House."
"I have the impression that we need much stricter measures than in the resolution we have so far shown to arrive at a cease-fire at all and to ensure that the bombing of the civilian population can finally cease and for it to be declared an internal problem."
"I believe that today at the OSCE meeting - this subject is being discussed at the same time over in Istanbul -, it is necessary for there to be a real possibility that will lead to peace negotiations, for the problem in the Caucasus cannot be resolved in the way the Russians want and I therefore feel it is very important for us not to just stand still, but that in particular the Commission also takes up this appeal and threatens to take action such as freezing new TACIS agreements so that it actually affects them and is not just something here on paper."
"It is a matter of great concern that I should like to make quite clear once again on behalf of my Group."
"For us the resolution does not go far enough, but it is a first step - hopefully to a peaceful solution in the region."
"- (FR) On the pretext of attacking fundamentalist terrorism, the leaders of Russia are conducting a despicable war in Chechnya."
"The Russian army is chiefly making attacks on the civilian population, an increasing proportion of whom are being forced to flee to neighbouring regions, only to be packed together in inhuman conditions."
"Once again it is the civilian population which is suffering from the consequences of the destruction of towns, villages and infrastructure of a country which is already very poor."
"The war is also a criminal one as regards the Russian people itself."
"Thousands of young men are forced to wage this dirty war which can have no positive outcome for either themselves or for their parents and elders."
"At a time when the transition to a capitalist economy is having the effect of causing a fall in production levels and the considerable impoverishment of the majority of the population, considerable sums of money are being swallowed up by the war effort, not to mention the cost of the corruption associated with it."
"We denounce the Russian leaders who are responsible for this war, but we also denounce the leaders of the Western world who make do with a mild reproach, while supporting Yeltsin and his clan, anxious as they are to protect them."
"In bombing the towns and villages of Chechnya, the Russian army is doing what the Western armies did a few months ago in bombing Kosovo and Serbia."
"Two wrongs do not make a right, but these crimes do shed light on the deep complicity of the governments, to the detriment of the peoples concerned."
"This is the explanation for our abstention."
"That concludes the vote."
"EU action plan to combat drugs (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0063/1999) by Ms Giannakou-Koutsikou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a European Union Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004) (COM(1999)239)."
"Mr President, first of all let me thank Marietta Giannakou most warmly because she has opened up the opportunity today by means of an exchange, to deal with the vote on Eurodac and thereby to create the conditions under which we can introduce this fingerprint checking."
"This is a very important report."
"I should first like to quote some figures so that you have an idea of the scale of the drug trade."
"First, we are dealing with the drug trade that in the meantime represents 8% of the volume of trade and makes billions in profits at the expense of young people and our families."
"Within the European Union we annually seize some 600 tonnes of cannabis."
"As far as the consumption of drugs is concerned, it is a fact that as many as 5 million young people take synthetic drugs and some 20% have tried cannabis."
"The legal position in Europe is extremely unsatisfactory."
"In the eyes of the citizens of Europe the battle against drug crime should be treated as an absolute priority."
"I therefore believe that Marietta Giannakou' s report is especially important and the action plan is something really fundamental that can help us in this field."
"It contains broad strategies, from prevention to repression to reintegration."
"It does not allow for any liberalisation or legalisation and sets priorities and brings domestic and foreign policy together in order to be able to combat drugs successfully."
"These are ambitious goals, but in reality it will not be easy, as up to now it has not been possible to obtain comparable data for individual Member States and to compare the methods and as long as we do not have this comparison of methods and dates it will also not be possible to achieve 'best practice' as a model."
"Prevention has little support and the youth programmes are not designed for support in combating drugs."
"The European Union makes relatively little money available."
"So what are the feasible and absolutely essential demands that we must make?"
"The first thing for me is that it is vital for the prevention policy to be intensified."
"I can see that there is quite a good chance of us attempting on a voluntary basis to declare schools as drug-free areas, to make it clear to schoolchildren through education that a life without drugs should be their main goal."
"We therefore need the support of the European Union programmes such as SOCRATES and LEONARDO."
"Secondly, we must urge the Member States most emphatically that we should finally obtain a standardised system of data and method registration so that it is possible to find the best models in the battle against drugs We must encourage cooperation between the police and the judiciary in the countries of Europe in the battle against drug crime and to protect young people."
"We must make the European Union programmes such as FALQONE, GROTIUS or OISIN more productive, organise them more efficiently and make more funds available."
"So with the action plan we have a good programme."
"It is, however, a matter of getting to work on turning this programme into action in the battle against drugs and for young people and for a drug-free society as a whole."
"That must be the aim, even if it is very difficult to achieve."
"Mr President, we would have liked the debate and the vote on this report not to have to take place today because - and I should like to say this right at the beginning - owing to the circumstances that led to the agenda being amended today and because of the fact that the voting time took so long because of the long Napolitano, Leinen, Dimitrakopoulos and Schwaiger reports, we will be voting on Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report tomorrow morning."
"Friday morning in Strasbourg is the day when there is the most pressure."
"Tomorrow the plenary sitting will be bursting with Members crowding in to vote on the Giannakou report."
"If there are fifty, that will be a lot."
"I venture to make this comment because it is a glaring contradiction to the other assertion that Mrs Giannakou' s report is so important and it should therefore absolutely be discussed and voted on this week."
"There is no logic behind that."
"In fact, our colleague' s report is an important report and must be discussed very carefully, among other reasons because the debate on the report has once again shown that drugs policy in the European Union is one of the most controversial subjects that we have ever had to discuss."
"I would first of all address a comment to the rapporteur."
"I believe that Mrs Giannakou has taken a lot of trouble to give an opinion on the action plan in a form that was geared to a consensus and was determined in such a way as to integrate the different ways of looking at the situation that not only go right through the political ""families"" but are also characterised by national traditions, by different factors and by partially conflicting interests."
"So our Group wishes to thank the rapporteur most warmly."
"I will say on behalf of my absent colleague Jan Andersson, who as a Swedish Member of Parliament - I shall speak about that again in a minute - was in a very difficult position, because Sweden is one of the Member States that has a very special approach to drugs policy, owing to its national experience and national tradition and which despite this I believe, as you do, Mrs Giannakou, with the compromise amendments have ensured that this report is actually structured in such a way that it will receive broad approval."
"128 amendments were submitted and you finally formulated 17 or 18 compromise amendments that should help to focus this profusion of amendments so that in the end a logical and conclusive report by the Parliament emerges on this action plan."
"The words ""logical"" and ""conclusive"" really mean that three essential aspects have to be taken into consideration."
"Firstly, all of us, whether on the right or left of this House must be clear and I do believe that the approach to drug policy must start from one premise: drug addicts do not on principle need punishment and persecution but help and support."
"That is really self-evident."
"Why do I have to mention that again here?"
"Because the way in which we help these people to reintegrate into society, the way in which we reduce their personal, individual suffering must derive from specific regional, local and national experiences."
"So there cannot be an officially prescribed European drugs policy but there must be a European framework within which help can be provided to the people affected who are the focus here, on the basis of the specific experiences of the local and regional authorities."
"The second aspect is that in our drugs policy we must bear in mind that in hardly any other branch of crime in Europe is more money earned than in the drug trade."
"That means that we can talk about reducing the supply, which is a very important factor but it still means that those people who supply drugs on the market must be pursued regardless."
"For this we need criminal law and the police."
"But we also need a factor that I feel has not been touched on adequately in the debate. Those people who deal in drugs generally do so if it is on a large scale, intending to make a profit and to enrich themselves."
"Everywhere we succeed in preventing illegal income from drug dealing from being converted into legal income, we have made great progress, that is to say, the battle against the drug trade and money laundering are phenomena that are linked."
"Policy on combating drugs - I address this to the Commissioner for internal security - therefore means that by reducing the supply there will be the resulting prosecution of the drug dealer, particularly in the area of money laundering."
"This is the third and final aspect, with which I will conclude. We all have different experiences."
"In one country in the European Union there is a rather permissive approach, in another a rather restrictive one."
"Overall if we consider the results of the Drug Monitoring Centre in Lisbon - almost everywhere there is an equally high drugs rate."
"This means that whatever the approach we adopt at present we are equally successful or unsuccessful."
"This means that we should set the parameters at a European scale and that implementation should be subsidiary and based on the respective national experiences."
"Mr President, if there is one issue for which we should keep our heads cool and our wits about us then it must be the drugs policy."
"The present report drafted by Mrs Giannakou is not exactly a shining example of this clarity."
"The debate is not being conducted in a very level-headed way."
"There is too much bellicose rhetoric and frankly, too much hullabaloo."
"We have noticed that slowly but surely this House has made some prudent steps in the right direction when it comes to dealing with this complex issue."
"This is certainly evident if we compare the present debate and text with those of a couple of years ago."
"At that time, hellfire and damnation were not punishment enough for Members who dared mention the words harm reduction or a therapeutic approach."
"To most people in this House, it was completely inconceivable that, apart from a repressive approach to the drugs policy, other, more effective strategies could also be developed."
"The Giannakou report represents a clear improvement on a number of points."
"It recognises the importance of urban and regional policy experiments, refers to harm reduction and is prepared to evaluate different pluralistic therapeutic approaches."
"Not very revolutionary and only a small step forward. But it gives cause for hope that bad practices can be compared on the basis of accurate data and that a humane and effective drugs policy will become a likelihood in an integrated European Union."
"The way in which these positive elements are formulated, however, leaves too much scope for opposing interpretations."
"Positive developments evident from the text cannot compete with the repressive mood which is still prevailing."
"Think, for example, of the enforced rehabilitation of drug addicts in prisons."
"This leads to inhumane situations and is not very effective if not taken on board out of one' s own free will."
"The objective of the aid policy should not be restricted to achieving total abstinence in the long run."
"One can live with drugs, as is the case - to many people' s delight - with alcohol and tobacco and as is the case with Prozac and Valium."
"Does the rapporteur' s ferocious war declaration apply here too?"
"After all, research has shown that a good joint is less harmful and addictive than some socially accepted drugs."
"Possibilities other than rehabilitation are still not mentioned in this report, although it is established practice in more and more Member States to supply drugs in a controlled manner, sometimes with very promising results."
"The rapporteur is of the opinion that a fatalistic outlook encourages drug abuse."
"This is a fallacy intended to sharpen the senseless war against drug abuse."
"It exacerbates marginalisation and crime and will lead to more crime."
"It is a repressive instrument which, unlike the addict, profits from this approach."
"Mr President, when I was 18 years old, there were no problems with drugs."
"We had of course heard that there were such things as drugs, but they were substances we were unfamiliar with and had never encountered. It was said however that some people got their doctors to supply them with substances they would otherwise not have had access to."
"Nor did we have open borders."
"We had no traffic from Third World countries, and nor did we have very much money so, even if the supply of drugs had been there, we would not, I am sure, have been able to buy them. The main point, however, was that we did not see any need for them."
"Today, the world looks rather different."
"It is open, and the Schengen Agreement has opened the borders between our countries to such a degree that we do not have much opportunity to exercise supervision."
"The fact which has to be faced is that the criminal forces which are involved in the manufacture and trading of drugs have a network, resources and powers which have far overtaken the constitutional states' ability to stop the drugs traffic."
"That is why there is a need for a Community policy for, in the situation in which the European Union finds itself, we must necessarily work together to combat cross-border crime."
"The report we have before us is quite excellent in what it says on a number of matters, and it points out with some clarity that, if we do not step up the war against the drug barons and financiers and their money laundering, then the constitutional states, our populations and our youth will lose out in this war."
"But the report also contains forms of words which were voted through by the Committee and which must look perfectly harmless, especially to those unfamiliar with these matters."
"They are concepts like harm reduction. And who would not want to reduce harm; who would not want to help people overtaken by a form of suffering as serious as drug dependency."
"Naturally, we all of us want to, and what we immediately think about in this connection is treatment, which is to say efforts involving a variety of social and medical provisions."
"But that is not what in fact lies behind the concept."
"Harm reduction means something quite different in the mouths of those who do not want to see a strict drugs policy pursued."
"May I say that I am completely at a loss to understand that philosophy, for drug abuse is not nowadays an isolated problem, affecting only the socially needy."
"I am well aware that it affects people who feel isolated or who are in social need, but these in fact constitute only a few of the people who today are victims of drug abuse."
"What our problem today is, is that young people, who may have good home lives, at the same time feel that their lives are so empty that they need an extra lift or trip on Saturday at the discotheque and to have their mood raised with the help of a drug they are lured into believing is harmless."
"In this connection, I cannot refrain from saying that I think that the speech which Mrs Buitenweg made here a moment ago is dangerous."
"I think it is dangerous for young people because it tempts them into believing - and I quote her - that ""one can live with drugs, as is the case with alcohol and tobacco"" ."
"I am well aware that you can become dependent upon tobacco."
"It also takes a relatively large number of years before you get lung cancer from it."
"I am well aware that you can become dependent upon alcohol, and I also know that there are people who lose their lives through alcohol abuse. However, there is a crucial difference in the case of tobacco and alcohol because, in the vast majority of cases, it is possible for people to control their use of these substances to a different degree than young people who have got mixed up in drug abuse are able to control their use of drugs."
"I therefore want to say that it is important that, in the work that is being done within the EU, we give a very central place to having an information campaign for young people, who may today all too easily be enticed by friends of their own age and by others to try substances which are presented to them as being harmless and as things no worse to take than an extra glass of beer or an extra little whisky."
"It is in fact something different we are talking about here, and it has not become dangerous because it is forbidden; rather, it is forbidden because it is dangerous."
"So let us get away from this nonsense about decriminalisation and this tendency to trivialise the whole problem area by closing our eyes to the criminals who exploit our young people and destroy their health."
"My group is a keen participant in the work which has been taking place in the Committee, and I should like to thank Mrs Giannakou for the sterling work she has done in this connection."
"We do not consider that, with the report we have before us and with what it contains, the definitive and best outcome has been obtained, and we very much hope that the Commissioner will be able to find still more effective and more powerful methods of combating this alarming misuse of drugs."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur pointed out, the European Commission affirms that neither the regulatory instruments nor the programmes for the Action Plan on the fight against drugs 1995-1999 have been sufficiently assessed."
"It is therefore impossible to determine to what extent the objectives laid down have been met."
"Given that we are talking about the fight against drugs, the Commission' s Communication is not included on the agenda of the Court of Auditors or even OLAF, but on Parliament' s agenda."
"Therefore, illogically, you are preparing to reconfirm the previous plan' s strategies for the next five years."
"You will all agree - right as well as left - because when we discuss drugs you restrict yourselves to having simple differences of opinion, and no group is brave enough to put forward alternative strategies."
"Indeed, when drugs are under discussion, the vast majority of you renounce your role as a government Member who, when faced with a problem, takes a lead on the issue and tries to resolve it, and, if the solution does not provide positive results or is counterproductive, as in this case, adopts a different policy."
"You do not want to examine the possibility of changing the prohibitionist policy on drugs, because, when it comes to political choices, you impose moral convictions and beliefs which are a matter for each individual' s conscience."
"In short, on this subject, you prevent true, scientific, secular debate by choosing an ethical approach which proves to be frustrating, ineffective and disastrous: disastrous because you try to justify things with the lack of financial resources."
"But how much would it cost to eliminate drug trafficking, a trade that the United Nations says accounts for 8% of world trade?"
"You refuse to carry out a cost-efficiency assessment because you would have to admit that with your policy you have handed over control of the production and trade in certain substances to a criminal monopoly."
"None of this surprises me: during this century crazy and incomprehensible things such as Nazism, Fascism and Communism have managed to gain power."
"Prohibition of drugs still remains: ethical, inhuman and anti-scientific madness."
"Mr President, the European Parliament is now establishing a policy, that is to say a drugs policy, which has emerged in fits and starts over a period of many years."
"It is a firm drugs policy."
"Thanks are due to all who have contributed to formulating it including, naturally enough on this particular day, the rapporteur Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, but also Sir Jack Stewart-Clark who has worked with these questions in previous years."
"May I perhaps emphasise that it is rather striking that I in particular, as a Swede, am very impressed indeed by this Parliament' s ability to produce what I consider to be a firm drugs policy."
"In fact, we Swedes have a fairly definite view of these questions."
"I think we can now count upon seeing good results in the field of drugs policy."
"I am particularly pleased that it is the Group of the European People' s Party' s drugs programme which in fact forms the basis of the present compromise."
"There are features which will mean that we embark upon a common road towards fewer drugs and with the goal of leading both society and individuals away from drugs and towards the long-term goal of a society without drugs."
"Once these measures which are now being proposed have taken effect, I believe that there will emerge in the Member States a greater sympathetic understanding of the differences between their respective policies."
"It is therefore important that it should be precisely that policy which is the best policy which should stand as an example."
"I should therefore like to urge the Commission to ensure in particular that the new Member States also have the opportunity to be present when the project is devised."
"In my own country, many people, it is true, feel rather discriminated against in this area."
"If we are bad at carrying out projects, we should like to improve."
"We should, however, also like to be present when assessments of on-going projects are carried out so that we might see which road the European Union will continue to go down."
"It is also important that we should comply with the laws of the different countries."
"We cannot, in this European Union, step into some kind of grey area of a community governed by law and not comply with our legislation."
"If we do not want to comply with our legislation, we must change our legislation and not pursue some kind of policy which does not follow the rules of a State governed by law."
"I should like to thank you for the efforts which have been made and urge us all to be very much more committed in the future."
"We are not there yet by any means. Rather, there is a very great deal of work which remains to be done."
"Unfortunately, many of the amendments on the table here in this Chamber place obstacles in the way, so I hope that many of them will be rejected."
"Mr President, given the fact that there are so few of us left and given the concerns for tomorrow morning' s vote, we should perhaps think about the significance of Fridays and their future."
"Unlike my colleagues from the Netherlands, Mr Wiebenga and Mr Blokland, I am proud of the Dutch policy."
"A hard-line approach on hard drugs, including XTC, is, at the same time, an effective way of lifting victims from the criminal circuit via a health-care approach and is also a policy which, fortunately, is attracting more and more followers elsewhere in Europe."
"What is the logic behind it?"
"The rationale?"
"One may well wonder following this discussion."
"What we have before us is the product of a long and emotionally-laden process and we have not finished by a long way because we are about to vote on this, that is tomorrow morning at 9.00 a.m."
"What is the issue?"
"The Commission has made an announcement regarding a European Union plan of action concerning drug control for the years 2000 to 2004."
"Compared with a previous plan of action, this document is clearly a step forward."
"We are now on track for a kind of mainstreaming of the drugs policy with the emphasis on prevention, but hardly any guiding choices are being made."
"Instead of making choices, we have mainly looked at the fantasy image of what avenues would be open to us once the war against drugs is over."
"Until such time, until we have won this war and our society is free from drugs, we are conducting an uncompromising battle against not only the drugs Mafia but also the poor coca farmers in Latin America and also the poppy planters in Asia."
"The militarisation of these societies, together with the fact that these poor people are not being given any effective help, means there are no truly sustainable prospects for the future."
"Is it not about time we drew up a cost-benefit analysis of what we are doing, which is in fact at the insistence of the US war on drugs?"
"Are drugs really at least as important as human rights, as suggested by the rapporteur, and why do we not learn from an effective approach as adopted in the Netherlands, for example?"
"Luckily, further to the Commission' s communication, we are making some room for users and some more room for potential users, young people, by pointing out the harmful effects."
"All in all this still has very little bearing on reality."
"After all, the Commission has repeatedly highlighted that the plan of action in this respect is merely a supplement."
"Perhaps it is so that the call made to the Presidency for an inter-pillar council could be seen as signalling a new opportunity, because this document still feels like a missed opportunity to me."
"Few issues so highlight the differences of cultural approach between Member States."
"I feel this report reflects a good consensus and I congratulate Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou on the work that she has done in putting it together."
"I belong to a growing minority in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and also in this House which believes a radical change to our approach may be needed."
"Why?"
"Quite apart from the ethical flaw in the prohibitionist argument - the state has no right to prevent a responsible adult from taking drugs - the fact is that prohibition is not working."
"Our approach, which is based on controlling the supply of drugs, is using up massive resources."
"The police in Bristol in my constituency tell me that 85% of all crime is drug-related."
"This is destroying our inner cities, where drug dealers find a large market and sometimes even become role models for disenchanted young people."
"It is filling our prisons with people who need care rather than incarceration, and it discriminates disproportionately against ethnic minorities, some of which have cultures in which drug abuse is less frowned upon than in others."
"But, more importantly, it is helping to fund other forms of criminal activity and strengthening international organised crime."
"We need at least to consider switching resources away from attacking the supply of drugs and towards attacking demand."
"Mr President, rapporteur, this drug programme primarily concerns people who are drug addicts and their families."
"They desperately need help."
"I therefore feel that it is very important to undertake an honest analysis of the results of the programme and to draw the necessary conclusions."
"The aims of this drug control programme are first and foremost to reduce the supply and demand."
"Neither of these aims has been achieved."
"Irrespective of the age group, country and drug concerned, drug taking is increasing or stagnating despite the harsh penalties and much greater number of prosecutions at national and increasingly at European level."
"The same applies to the reduction in the supply of drugs."
"For a long time only 10% of the drug trade has been caught by the police."
"These shattering results are hushed up."
"Instead, the drug programme before us just contains a copy of the previous programme with cosmetic changes."
"Fortunately the Commission is undertaking an evaluation."
"However, an external assessment would clearly be better on this sensitive subject."
"In any case, the appropriate action will have to be taken."
"Despite the lack of success of the programme, a large part of the financial resources in the context of the drug programme goes into combating drugs."
"For anything that is aimed at minimising the damage, there is a very small amount left over."
"The question remains, however, why this programme is not clearly aiming to achieve the hidden goals."
"We cannot escape the conclusion that the very fact of this programme' s existence is all that matters, and that in fact it serves different aims to those that have been stated."
"What does this mean?"
"The drug programme is used to increase the legitimacy of the EU."
"Drug programmes therefore have a purely instrumental character."
"And because that is at the expense of the addicts, we urgently need to think again."
"There is no ideal solution in drug policy, we all agree on that."
"But action must be taken."
"The urgent aim must be to minimise the damage and that must be firmly established in the drug programme."
"What that means in practice I shall show in four demands with which I shall now conclude."
"Firstly, supply should be reduced to the minimum."
"Secondly, methadone programmes should be expanded in the EU and the tried and tested controlled practice of the handing in of heroin should be introduced."
"Thirdly, drugs users should be able to test drugs for their content and mixture."
"Only in this way can further damage be prevented; we therefore need EU-wide drug checking."
"Fourthly, city cooperation should be promoted, taken from the idea of the European Cities Drug Policy as a prime example of a project that recognises - legal and illegal - drugs as belonging to society and lends support to people dealing responsibly with these drugs."
"We urgently need such a drug programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I must confess that I am no fundamentalist where this matter is concerned and I respect those who hold different opinions."
"I particularly respect the opinion that has just been expressed by Mr Watson, whom I hold in great esteem."
"But I do not believe that in the name of efficiency, we can lay aside principles, and I shall start with such just such a matter of principle: we believe that drugs are an evil that must be fought."
"They are a vice that weakens the will, which ensnares the individual in a dependency which enslaves and depersonalises him or her, which destroys social bonds and relationships, which creates delinquency and makes society less safe, and which sustains world-wide criminal networks that defy States' power and law."
"We think that it is obvious that we have to wage an uncompromising war against drugs."
"This message is clearly made in Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report and deserves our applause."
"Indeed, this is a problem of this day and age and is extremely worrying."
"We know that drugs affect all countries and all social classes, and we also know that Europe' s enlargement towards the East dramatically shows the urgent need for efficient measures now that monitoring, which is already difficult, is going to become even more difficult."
"We know that this is a growing problem. According to the report by the European Monitoring Centre, cannabis is still the most widely consumed drug throughout the European Union, although it is heroin that causes the most problems in terms of requests for treatment, drug-related deaths, HIV infection and social exclusion."
"The same report, furthermore, shows an increase in the consumption in Europe of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, as well as an increase in the consumption of more traditional drugs such as LSD and amphetamines."
"And all of this becomes more frightening if we consider that, at the moment, drug-related crime and the scale of drug trafficking represent around 8% of world trade."
"We agree that this problem must be tackled from three angles: by reducing demand, by controlling drug trafficking and by combating drug addiction."
"We agree that public awareness campaigns must be implemented and, at the same time, that we must strengthen prevention networks."
"In the area of treatment, we must give support to high-quality programmes aimed at the whole community, using educational methods, including those targeting the prison population, together with initiatives designed to promote the reduction of risk, one example of which is the needle exchange programme."
"With regard to reducing the availability of drugs, we must continue and increase our support to producing countries, so that they include in their priorities the reduction of demand and programmes for destroying crops, the destruction of laboratories and the prevention of trafficking."
"For this reason, the political will required by this report must become reality."
"If we limit ourselves to fine words, the conclusion will have to be that there has not been the political will. This can be measured by the efficiency of the actions and the public resources placed in the service of this fight."
"The report highlights the fact, and rightly so, that the budgetary resources are inadequate."
"This Parliament does not have the right to ask the Member States for greater commitment and greater investment in the fight against drugs if it does not lead by example on an issue for which it has responsibility."
"The main European instrument in this struggle is the European Monitoring Centre in Lisbon."
"We expect a great deal from its work, in terms of a better understanding of the phenomenon, in terms of the existence of data and comparable information, and, above all, in terms of monitoring, identifying and proposals to ban dangerous substances placed on the market."
"This is why we proposed amendments to this report. They were, in essence, accepted and seek to strengthen the role of the Monitoring Centre and to provide it with the necessary financial means for its work."
"The other thing that our citizens are asking from us here is clarity."
"Giving fine speeches is not enough."
"We must take decisions and release resources which correspond to the commitment that we claim to have in this vital fight against organised crime for the sake of human dignity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission communication on the Union' s action plan to combat drugs is an important and positive communication."
"This plan covers all aspects of the problem and opens new prospects for a more mainstream, efficient approach."
"However, and this goes without saying, more resources are needed."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Giannakou on her highly substantive report, especially the emphasis on international collaboration and the introduction of a systematic, yearly inter-pillar Council meeting to improve the monitoring and evaluation of action intended mainly to reduce the supply of drugs."
"In the light of the international agreement concluded by the Special Session of the United Nations Organisation in June 1998 for a balanced approach to the problem which aims to reduce both supply and demand, I would like to highlight the potential offered by Article 152 of the Treaty."
"This article allows the Union to complement national policies with action directed towards improving public health, preventing illness and reducing drugs-related damage to health."
"The European Union action plan for the period from 2000 to 2004 must therefore include, over and above what is mentioned in the report, practices and programmes directed towards breaking the habit and restricting damage to the health of drug users."
"Similarly, we need to focus our attention on and give priority funding to programmes to evaluate practices aimed at prevention, treatment and reintegration and in connection with the consequences to society and public health, so that Member States and applicant countries can use the conclusions as a guide when deciding their national policy."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the European monitoring centre in Lisbon is carrying out important work and I trust that the information and data collected by it will prove how efficient European and international collaboration has been in this difficult fight."
"Mr President, I am speaking in place of my colleague, Mr Hernández Mollar and, on his behalf, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou on the excellent work which she has done."
"It is clear that the drug problem, not only on a European level but also on a world level, requires the special attention of politicians, institutions and the whole of civil society."
"On 26 October, in this Parliament, the President of Colombia, a country which unfortunately has strong links with the drug problem, told us: ""Drug trafficking has been the great creator of violence and has led to assassinations of the highest possible human cost to our country"" ."
"And we are not talking here about an issue which only affects the Member States nor the European Union, but an issue which directly affects human beings in any country of the world."
"Our first concern in this Parliament should be to point out that the responsibility is collective, that it requires collaboration, cooperation and coordination between the judicial and penal authorities and between the different continents, whether they be the European Union, Latin America, South East Asia or African countries."
"The second concern is that the European Union must play a greater role in the field of reducing the demand for drugs."
"To this end, the European Parliament, in this resolution, has highlighted and strengthened the role which the European Observatory on Drugs and Drug Addiction must play by giving it greater means and resources to fulfil its objective efficiently."
"I would like particularly to stress the importance of the fight against traffickers who use and exploit illegal immigrants, especially on the Southern border of Europe, in Andalucia, Ceuta and Melilla, which have become a channel for drug trafficking."
"I would like to dedicate the third consideration to the group which is most affected by this social scourge; our young people."
"A recent survey carried out in my country indicated that the second greatest social problem in the eyes of our young people was, after unemployment, the drug problem."
"As the resolution says, drugs give rise to family problems, work problems and road accidents."
"If we add to this the considerable increase which has been observed in the consumption of alcohol by young people, which in many cases goes hand in hand with drug-taking, especially synthetic drugs, we can see the need to adopt urgent measures which will reverse this trend."
"Action in the field of education and families, economic cooperation with associations and NGOs, especially in the field of leisure and sport, will complement the actions which must banish this ""pressure valve"" from the lives of our young people which sometimes means that they are destroyed by something which starts out as a means of escape."
"But we cannot solve these problems by talk alone."
"Resources are required."
"Both the Member States and the European Union itself must prioritise, in their budgets, the economic means which will allow the implementation of the measures proposed, including prevention, suppression and rehabilitation."
"And unfortunately this is still not the case."
"Mr President, congratulations to my colleague on her report."
"In my part of Europe 3 million people are on illegal drugs, that includes 28% of 16-29 year-olds and 14% of 14-15 year-olds."
"12,000 new, notified addict cases come each year; we have 70,000 drug offenders a year and we lose 1,200 people through drug-related deaths per year."
"This is a battle which we may not be winning now, but which we must not lose."
"We need a multi-pronged policy, we need to act together to stop the growers and the traders and the pushers, but we also need policies on education and health and we need to encourage research."
"If we simply cut the supply and not the demand, then we will end up with a higher price for the drugs on the street and with more crime being committed to pay for people's habits."
"Many of the amendments to this report before us are therefore right."
"We need to educate young people."
"We need role models from music and fashion and film to get the message across to young people: not just by saying ""no"", that does not work, but by telling them the truth."
"The truth is that drugs can bring pleasure but also the truth is that they can damage health."
"Damage in the form of cancer and heart disease, in memory and concentration loss, testicular problems and so on, and young people need to understand that, too."
"Drug-taking is wrong, but we need to help those who are willing to accept help."
"I shall never forget, as a minister responsible for fighting drugs, going and meeting a young man who had lost his health and his friends and his relationships, his family, his jobs, his prospects and his self-respect."
"He was being helped to help himself come out of that deep black hole of addiction."
"I stupidly asked him ""Do you feel you are beating it yet?"" and he said to me ""I have a lifetime struggle ahead of me - if I ever think that I have beaten it, then I am lost""."
"He deserves our support."
"He needs the research to make sure that we have effective treatments and we need to give him that help and that confidence."
"But how much better if we could destroy this evil by persuading future generations of young people that it is simply not for them; it is simply not worth taking the risk."
"Mr President, in my intervention I will attempt to summarise the opinions of my Italian colleagues, Mr Costa and Mr Nisticò, too, who were previously down to speak, but are unable to be here due to the postponement of this debate."
"As the Italian delegation, too, we wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou, on her excellent work."
"As many Members have reminded us, we are dealing with the difficulty of finding a balance, which, nevertheless, has been achieved."
"The difficulty stems from the different experiences and policies of the Member States."
"At the same time, we must also initiate different types of relations between the Union as a whole and the activities of the individual states, and between the principle of subsidiarity and the need - which has also, rightly, been expressed - for the Union to equip itself with a common policy on this phenomenon which is a real concern for our present, but also for our future."
"From the point of view of values, I am convinced of this and I totally agree with the ideas expressed by Mr Coelho, and therefore I will not repeat them."
"Frankly, I am uneasy listening to some positions that send this message to young people: get used to living with ecstasy, get used to living with valium, i.e. get used to a life full of drugs."
"I refuse to accept that politics should give way upon this issue."
"I said that the report is excellent, not just because it rightly puts the two elements of the matter back into the spotlight - a combined action to reduce demand and to reduce supply - but also, may I say, because of the frankness with which Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou criticises what is still insufficient in the Commission proposal, both from a financial and economic point of view - we cannot state the importance of a battle and then not follow through in financial terms - and from the point of view, shall we say, of the political half-heartedness regarding the initiatives that the States still have not made."
"Therefore, this excellent idea to convene an ""inter-pillar"" Council is one we should support."
"In conclusion, I would just like to emphasise two points that, in our experience as Italians, are particularly important and significant: firstly, the importance of supporting basic scientific research as well so that we gain a greater understanding of the phenomenon, and, if possible, receive early warning of what the alleged drugs of the future will be, especially finding out the devastating effects of synthetic drugs; secondly, the importance of involving in these actions those principally concerned, those who are in the front line every day, who help drug addicts, that is, the experiences of treatment centres."
"I think that these should be supported and encouraged."
"Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou willingly accepted this request from the Italian delegation."
"I think that, in future, when we address this subject again, it will be useful to come back to the point of who is managing and helping drug addicts today."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Counterfeit travel documents"
"The next item is the report (A5-0050/1999) by Mr Newton Dunn on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Council Decision on the improved exchange of information to combat counterfeit travel documents (8457/1999 - C5-0011/1999 - 1999/0804(SNS))."
". This is a very uncontentious, uncontroversial report except for just one single point, which involves everybody who is listening."
"The proposal is to develop a computerised image archiving system to help detect forged travel documents."
"I imagine that we all agree that is worth doing."
"So what is the single point of controversy?"
"It is whether this decision is going to be made behind closed doors in Brussels by officials and ministers, or whether there will be parliamentary scrutiny."
"Fifteen national parliaments cannot do so, because it is a European proposal and this task will fall to us if to anybody."
"Now the history of this proposal is that in January of this year, the Commission put forward the same proposal and said its purpose was to detect documents brought in by illegal immigrants."
"The proposal lapsed when the Amsterdam Treaty came into effect in May."
"It has now been retabled by the German Government, as a national government is entitled to do, under the Amsterdam Treaty."
"However, the problem is that the German Government says its purpose is to deal with I quote 'crime' and leaves out the word immigration."
"Why?"
"Because under the Amsterdam Treaty, immigration questions are transferred from the third pillar to the first pillar and become the responsibility, for the first time, of Parliament."
"However, criminal matters remain in the third pillar and we have no area of scrutiny, no responsibility at all."
"Therefore, the German Government in my submission is seeking to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of its proposal."
"The committee did not like that."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms invited the Finnish Presidency and the German Government to come and answer our questions about the proposal."
"The Finnish Presidency replied in a letter to the committee that it would not come, it would not answer our questions."
"However, it did say that we could ask put questions in plenary."
"Well, here we are in the plenary - where is the Council of Ministers?"
"Everybody can see that the seats are empty except for one charming lady in grey who is an official and is not allowed to speak."
"But I hope she will take away this message."
"The fact that the German Government has sought to avoid parliamentary scrutiny altogether by keeping this under the third pillar and the fact that the Finnish Presidency has not even turned up to answer our questions either in committee or in plenary is, I am sorry to say, a great stain on the reputation of the Finns, who previously had a wonderful reputation for openness and democracy."
"I am also very sorry that they are not here to answer my accusation."
"To conclude, the committee has voted to change the legal base so that this matter comes back under the first pillar, because this proposal is primarily about detecting forged documents carried by illegal immigrants."
"I am asking everyone who is here to vote tomorrow morning to support the committee, to establish parliamentary control over this new area of policy, which is our remit under the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"In his request to speak he referred to an important field, that is the institutional field and everything concerned with it."
"What I should like to do is to refer to the opportunities that this system offers us."
"The paper deals with combating the counterfeiting of travel documents."
"It is a system for registration and comparison and thus an instrument that also helps to combat illegal entry and illegal immigration or the committing of criminal acts under a false identity."
"That means that in order to be able to combat this phenomenon, which is partly a phenomenon of organised crime, we need new and very effective instruments."
"One instrument is the system discussed here to combat the counterfeiting of travel documents."
"After all, it should also help us to combat the crime of smuggling, which is on the increase."
"If the figures are correct, then we have in the meantime learned that almost the same criminal earnings are obtained from smuggling as from drug crime and with considerably less risk than with drug-related crime."
"I have been given access to figures that show that of the 400,000 to 500,000 illegal immigrants who come to the European Union every year, at least 200,000 are brought into the European Union by smugglers."
"These counterfeit documents are very often used in smuggling cases."
"In other areas too, where there is asylum abuse, there is counterfeiting of documents that are passed on from one person to another."
"Unfortunately this has become part of a system."
"In this regard, the system that Mr Newton Dunn described should be welcomed and supported."
"I should, however, like to mention one point with which we are not happy."
"That is the fact that in parallel we have developed the FADO system that allows us to compare original documents and counterfeit documents pictorially."
"In reality, we therefore have two systems that should be amalgamated in one system."
"Because rather than coming across counterfeit documents it is of course better if we have previously compared original and counterfeit documents via the FADO system."
"That means that the aim should not be to run two parallel systems side by side, but to unite both of them in one system in the interests of efficiency."
"Overall this action to combat counterfeit documents by comparing information that is not person-related is to be welcomed."
"But we should try to be more efficient so that two systems do not run in parallel but are associated with each other so that something is achieved: so that with the Schengen information system and the EURODAC information system together we can contribute to a safer Europe."
"Mr President, allow me to welcome the initiative by Germany to improve the exchange of information on counterfeit documents."
"This exchange of information is of great importance for the protection and security of people in Europe."
"Europe needs a legal area in which its citizens feel at home and protected."
"An essential contribution to this is the cross-border regulations and protection systems that make life difficult for criminals."
"The German initiative endeavours to achieve such a system."
"By exchanging information on counterfeit documents the counterfeiting itself is contained."
"That is an essential contribution to combating smuggling and other crimes and - I think this is very important - all other kinds of crime."
"So it is quite sensibly in the proposal for a Council Decision."
"The rapporteur wants to amend paragraph 3 of the preamble and limit the crimes to the offence of illegal immigration."
"He implies that illegal immigration is the greatest crime that we have to combat."
"My dear colleague, where do you actually live?"
"Have you never heard anything about drug dealers and the couriers of the money launderers with suitcases full of bank notes?"
"Do I really have to make you a list of travellers' crimes?"
"Amendment 6 is a disgrace!"
"It mocks our citizens who expect protection and security from the European Union."
"We must vote by a large majority against this amendment."
"We cannot allow ourselves the intellectual freedom to be afraid of a few poor creatures who sneak in with forged documents and at the same time guarantee serious criminals the freedom to travel."
"The Legal Committee that has dealt with this matter was also unanimous and, I repeat, unanimous, in this opinion with all the other Groups after an in-depth examination and, as I said just now, I want this measure to apply to all crime."
"That is the reason why my Group will vote against all these amendments in the vote tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, I too would like to support the substance of the German Council initiative to improve on the exchange of information on counterfeit travel documents and to strengthen the security of the European Union's borders both for Member States such as my own, the United Kingdom, which are outside of Schengen as well as those that are at the EU perimeter."
"Recently my country, the United Kingdom, has been subject to an enormous rise in the inward flow of peoples and in my previous job as a Central London hospital doctor I witnessed a significant degree of illegal immigration and fraudulent abuse of our generous asylum policy."
"We in the UK are currently witnessing something of the order of 7,000 new applicants for asylum every month and over 80% of these eventually turn out after investigation to be bogus."
"This represents some 100,000 people per year including their dependants coming into my country."
"I personally have come across a Nigerian asylum seeker being granted asylum on the strength of a false Liberian passport, an Albanian family who passed themselves off as Kosovans, another Nigerian who had loaned his British passport to his cousin who was able to enter the United Kingdom under the identity of his cousin and then commit a crime, and an Algerian who was living under the identity of a French citizen and who had bought his ID card on the Parisian black market."
"These are just some of the many abuses of which I have personal experience and we know that for the immigration authorities these examples are a daily occurrence."
"How can we expect our own immigration and police authorities to be able to crack down on the systematic abuse of our system?"
"We have a duty to remember that this constant flow of illegal immigration is posing an enormous burden, in particular in inner cities, on our national health service, social services and social security system as well as putting huge pressure on our limited housing stock."
"Unfortunately, there is evidence that large numbers of asylum-seekers have been waved through Continental Europe with a suggestion that they head towards our Channel ports in the knowledge that we have a permissive policy with instant rights to housing and social security benefits."
"Although the British Conservative Party is formally opposed in principle to commissioning under Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the first pillar of policies on visas, immigration and asylum - and I therefore have to disagree with our rapporteur on this issue - nevertheless we welcome intergovernmental cooperation under the third pillar through Council joint action on the exchange of such information, including that relating to forged travel documents in order to crack-down on crime, particularly international crime which respects no national boundaries."
"There is evidence that organised crime has spotted a soft and lucrative target in the illegal traffic of human beings who are often prepared to spend their life savings to gain entry to wealthy western countries in the hope of making a new life for themselves."
"This initiative is, therefore, in my view, a step in the right direction with the use of modern computer image digitalising technology to aid law enforcement agencies and interior ministries to cooperate throughout the Union."
"It is a good example in my view of the sort of European Union venture that my party in the United Kingdom can support so long as it is done on a flexible, intergovernmental basis."
"Mr President, the comments by the previous speaker, Mr Tannock, should show Mr Newton Dunn why Mrs Gebhardt rejects his amendment."
"The German government has taken an initiative to restrict and gain better control of the counterfeiting of travel documents - and that is in the context of the freedom of movement in the European Union."
"Mr Newton Dunn has now, on the pretext that the Parliament could not have such a strong influence under the third pillar as with his legal base, chosen the approach to amend the legal base and in doing so he has limited the target group taken into consideration to those who are affected under the first pillar within the meaning of the security policy of the European Union."
"That then led to a Member such as Mr Tannock giving an inflammatory speech about immigration!"
"That goes together very well if you have the philosophy of a British Tory, which amounts to an anti-European view!"
"However, this only marginally concerns Germany' s initiative to strengthen the security structures in Europe."
"But it does provide pretexts for the politicians who in the meantime colour every debate on security in Europe with the subject of illegal immigration."
"I should just like to say something here to our colleague from London: having heard your speech, I must ask you a question in return."
"Is Europe now really an immigration continent or not?"
"If you answer in the affirmative with your lively description that Europe is an immigration continent should we not finally take action and create legal structures on immigration?"
"You would be the first to say 'no' , I am quite sure of that!"
"We are not a continent of immigration and we don' t need any immigration rules!"
"But what does the whole debate show us?"
"Mr Newton Dunn has perhaps chosen a sensible approach from the viewpoint of the European Parliament in order to increase our influence."
"We have already seen the political effects that that has."
"Remaining under the third pillar does integrate more groups of people, as Mrs Gebhardt has just said, that is to say, all criminals who forge travel documents."
"But we have not integrated the Parliament as strongly as with the Newton Dunn legal base."
"Overall, that shows that neither the third pillar nor the marginal transfer of responsibilities to another pillar are sufficient to create efficient security structures in Europe."
"Commissioner, you must together with us make that clear to the Council."
"You did so in Tampere, you did it before, and you must do it again."
"The debate here shows that not all of our efforts bear fruit, because the government cooperation is not sufficient to convert the needs resulting from the internal market structure and the associated speed of integration into new legislation on security structures in Europe and it does not operate in accordance with Amsterdam."
"We must draw the necessary conclusions from this, otherwise it will not work in practice."
"Because we are arguing here about the legal bases, we are conducting some stupid debates about illegal immigration - that is something for the Tory Party conference, but ineffective for Europe - and we are completely neglecting what we should do, that is, create effective legislation to restrict the counterfeiting of documents, both by those who illegally provide access to Europe and those who, as Mrs Gebhardt rightly said, travel thorough Europe with a suitcase full of heroin but with counterfeit documents too."
"Mr Newton Dunn, because we are of the view that in weighing up your proposal, that is a very worthy one, and the intention that the German Council Presidency had in its time, we must decide in favour of the greater target area, we shall reject your amendment, not only because of the legal base, but as a consequence of all the others, which does not alter the fact that you have undertaken a careful piece of work."
"You have indeed done that, but on this subject we differ greatly in our political views!"
"Mr President, I have to give the House some good news, and I am sure you will welcome it as such."
"Yesterday' s newspapers, published today in press reviews across Italy, said: ""Long-life gene discovered: life could be increased by a third"" , or by 35% to be precise."
"Therefore, I think that, if at the moment I am hoping to reach 90, I will actually reach 130."
"You will say, what does this have to do with counterfeit travel documents?"
"I will tell you straight away."
"You know that I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party, elected to Parliament from that list."
"The pensioners are always asking me what they are cooking up in the pot in Brussels."
"They are aware of the fact that in Brussels - but above all in the fifteen Member States of the Union - they take these pensioners and they throw as many of them as possible into boiling water."
"This is what has been happening for some time, and, with this new piece of news, I think that the pot will be heated even more so that even more pensioners can be boiled, if possible all together."
"In addition to the serious harm that they know they have to suffer, there is also the fact that, unfortunately, being elderly, they more than other people are more likely to be the targets of the criminal acts which, throughout the European Community, are sadly being perpetrated by many people who illegally enter the Union and then commit them once they are in."
"I would therefore like to say to my friends and fellow Members, Mr Gebhardt and Mr Schulz, that, firstly, in the amendments tabled by Mr Newton Dunn, the need to combat crime and the trade in human beings is not avoided but confirmed."
"I would also like to say that if these criminals do not enter illegally, then they will not commit crimes either; if, on the other hand, they are decent people and have their travel documents in order, then we are quite happy for them to enter."
"It is precisely for this reason that we are saying that what this measure is doing is positive - even if it reminds us of Arsène Lupin, the gentleman thief - but it would be much better to have a European electronic identity card which is the same in all the States."
"Above all, it would be much better for supervision at European borders to be increased, on the borders of Spain, Greece and Italy as well as Eastern Europe..."
"It is pointless to invest money, effort and hard work for other reasons."
"We must prevent large numbers of people illegally entering the European Union who then go on to commit crimes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"Losses under loans for projects outside the Community"
"The next item is the report (A5-0051/1999) by Mrs Rühle on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe and Western Balkans, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia and the Republic of South Africa) (COM(1999)142 - C5-0039/1999 - 1999/0080(CNS)."
"I wish to thank you all for waiting so long as we have been relatively busy today and for a long time we did not know when the report would come up."
"However, today and tomorrow I should like to be able to vote on the procedures of guarantees by the Community for the European Investment Bank, the EIB for short, because if possible, we want to decide before the Council and because we also want to make certain changes, which I shall refer to in detail."
"The provision of these guarantees concerns the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Latin America, Asia and South Africa."
"It relates to the period up to the year 2003 under my proposal, to be precise until 31 January 2003, then there will be a review half way through and we shall then deal with it again or extend it until 31 January 2007."
"It involves a sum of EUR 9 475 million and the provision of guarantees amounting to a maximum of 60%."
"There are few inconsistencies in this regard. The inconsistencies are to be found in other areas."
"The main problem area with which my report deals, which became clearer as I worked on the report, is that the European Investment Bank, as far as modern business management, transparency and public work are concerned, is trailing rather far behind."
"Some of the people I have spoken to have explained that the European Investment Bank is trailing some twenty years behind the World Bank as far as modern business management is concerned."
"I therefore believe it is important that we deal with this subject more intensively."
"The European Investment Bank is the largest public bank in Europe, its general owners are the Member States and it works primarily with low-interest loans."
"Owing to the fact that its shareholders do not expect high interest rates and the thus possible low gearing rate, that is the ratio of the lending volume to equity capital, of 2.5 - market rates are usually over 10 - the Bank enjoys considerable confidence on the capital markets."
"This high level of confidence on the capital markets enables it to take up loans under favourable conditions and to on-lend at accordingly favourable rates."
"Furthermore, the Bank enjoys tax exemption and not least, guarantees from the EU budget for political risks too."
"Despite this direct and indirect assistance to the Bank from the European Union, the EIB is keen to appear to the public as a quite ordinary bank and in the past that was how it justified its relative inaccessibility for cooperation and monitoring to the public compared to other public institutions like the World Bank."
"In our view, that should and must now change as a matter of urgency."
"My report therefore also deals first and foremost with the subjects of accountability and transparency, that is, modern business practice."
"Over the last few years there has been a lot of criticism of the internal administration and business management of the EIB."
"Nevertheless, for a long time the Bank refused to allow the Court of Auditors or OLAF to inspect its books, invoking its special nature as a bank."
"The particular ""constipation"" of the EIB in matters of public monitoring and transparency even led the ECOFIN Council on 8 August 1999 to state the following, and I quote: ""In view of the important financial task assigned to the European Investment Bank by the Treaty and a series of Community regulations, it must take an exemplary attitude to fraud control and allow OLAF, where necessary, to undertake inspections."
"The Council does not doubt that the governing body of the Bank will shortly submit a proposal to their board of governors for a decision in accordance with the inter-institutional agreement."""
"We are now seeing the first signs that the Bank will open its books."
"However, in my view they are not yet adequate and there is still mistrust."
"This mistrust is increased further by its dealings to date with Mr Blak, the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who has been waiting for a long time to answers to his questions."
"I should like once again to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control for its preparatory work in this regard, which has allowed me in the short time available to draw up this report, and I should especially like to thank Mr Blak and Mrs Theato."
"In the future we shall also have to watch the development of the EIB with regard to more transparency and for all sceptics, it is also a matter of economic efficiency."
"A business that cuts itself off will be taking its decisions on a very narrow basis."
"Dialogue with society in general, as the World Bank, among others, has been practising in the meantime, also provides information for investment decisions."
"Here, also, the Bank has been criticised in the past, both regarding its investments in the health sector in my own country, that particularly consolidate antiquated structures and in the transport and environment sectors in Eastern Europe."
"It cannot and may not suffice in the future for the Bank to restrict itself to the isolated inspection of individual projects - such as, for example a section of motorway -, it must also inspect the projects in context - for example within a transport development plan in a particular country, in order to be able to identify duplication and to develop an acceptable and financially sustainable alternative."
"For this reason the Bank should undertake a public relations offensive in the regions that have received assistance."
"The European Parliament should therefore in the next few years direct its attention to the development of the EIB."
"The bases are set out in my report and I hope that they will be adopted tomorrow."
"Thank you very much!"
"I have overrun a little, but I wanted you to understand what this report is all about because the report is all Greek to most people!"
"I note, Mrs Rühle, that it is very difficult to stop you."
"You have overrun your allotted speaking time by 25%."
"That' s a huge amount!"
"Mr President, Mrs Rühle has produced an excellent report on this subject."
"I am the newly appointed rapporteur on the EIB, the European Central Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"I agree with the amendments proposed by Mrs Rühle as they express clearly real concerns about the EIB's transparency, efficacy, accountability and conformity with the Community's objectives and policies."
"I will address briefly each of these concerns."
"Firstly, there is widespread concern about the EIB's transparency."
"My predecessor from the Socialist Group, Mr Freddy Blak, Mrs Rühle, the author of the report, many Members of Parliament and the Court of Auditors have all expressed their opinion about the lack of transparency in the operations of the EIB."
"Even the World Bank and the East European NGO called Bankwatch have publicly stated this view."
"Secondly, let me turn to efficacy."
"Mrs Rühle states the need to evaluate the effectiveness of EIB operations."
"I, as the new rapporteur for the Bank, requested Sir Brian Unwin, the President of the EIB, for an initial meeting to set out a framework to assess the efficiency of the Bank."
"I am sorry to report to this House that Sir Brian has not even bothered to ring me or arrange to meet despite numerous telephone reminders."
"Such disregard for this new European Parliament will erode, yet again, public respect and confidence in the European Union."
"Thirdly, what about public accountability?"
"In May 1999, my predecessor, Mr Blak, Vice-President of CoCobu, asked 26 specific questions about alleged fraud, mismanagement, corruption and cover-up - I mean cover-up - in the Bank's activities, including in treasury operations, over the period 1993-1998."
"The questions are specific, detailed and relevant."
"They require a written response from the Bank."
"I have asked Sir Brian for such a response but, once again, he has chosen to ignore my request."
"I have been told by Mr Martí, one of his vice-presidents, that the EIB is owned by the Member States and, as such, according to the Treaty, it is not an EU institution obliged to respond to the European Parliament, the Court of Auditors or OLAF."
"Only matters relating to loans to non-EU countries where the Community gives loan guarantees can be discussed with Members of Parliament."
"I ask this House, what are the Member States?"
"Are they not the governments of the people who live, work and pay taxes in the countries that we call Member States?"
"Are we not, as the only elected representatives of the people of these Member States, expected to safeguard the interests of the people who live in the Member States?"
"Does the Treaty specifically forbid the European Parliament from having access to information?"
"Certainly not."
"Therefore, if the EIB is confident that it functions well and has nothing to hide, why is Sir Brian Unwin, its president, denying access to Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF?"
"Clearly, the Treaty needs to be amended to specify such access in bold print."
"I suggest that those involved in the IGC take note."
"Clearly there is support for this as Ecofin, in its meeting on 8 October in Tampere, reinforced its previous criticisms of the EIB's management and performance by directing it to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors."
"I have seen the decision taken by the EIB concerning this directive and according to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the decision taken by the Bank it will not open its doors to OLAF."
"It is about time this House told the Bank to open its doors to OLAF and the Court of Auditors."
"Mr President, the succession of earthquakes that have wrought destruction on north-eastern Turkey have led us to consider it crucial to increase the sums allocated to that country, and therefore, we voted, on the first reading, in favour of a revision of the financial perspectives which include emergency support for Turkey on a par with the priority that we gave to the reconstruction of East Timor."
"In addition to this budgetary boost, it is also essential to strengthen support for Turkey by means of credit on favourable terms, and we therefore support the rate of risk cover by the Community budget."
"At the same time, it was with a certain amount of pleasure that we received the news, recently, that the European Investment Bank has finally accepted the scrutiny of its management by Community institutions."
"In any event, we think that it is essential for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty to establish the European Investment Bank as an institution under the full control of the Community, under the supervision of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament, so that it does not merely answer to a general assembly of Member States, as it seeks to do at the moment."
"As soon as all the Bank' s activity is supported by a considerable Community budget effort, which guarantees the risks linked to banking activity, the scrutiny of its accounts must be developed with the utmost rigour and care."
"When both Parliament and public opinion were surprised at information published in the press, according to which an institution that we thought was involved entirely in structural investments had lost very considerable sums in short-term speculative operations, it became clear that there was a need to scrutinise the EIB' s investment policy thoroughly."
"The multiplying effect of a banking guarantee means that investments resulting from EIB credits are of crucial importance in the context of policies subsidised by the Community budget."
"It would not, therefore, be reasonable, through this guarantee, to support different policies from those decided on by the European Union."
"This is not a question of interfering in commercial lending policy, a matter which is the sole competence of the EIB' s management, but merely of guaranteeing respect for democratic decisions and for stringent, transparent rules."
"The EIB is the trustee of a valuable Community inheritance, both from the point of view of the actions that it has helped to implement and from the point of view of the amounts of money that it has accumulated."
"We are sure that the EIB will continue to play this role in the future."
"Mr President, this report by Mrs Rühle is excellent, as it underlines the principles which the European Parliament has held as important when we have tried to improve our administration."
"The reports by Mrs Rühle and Mr Seppänen both concern the same issue: guarantees against loans granted to the European Investment Bank."
"In itself, the European Investment Bank is an excellent instrument for financing specific projects."
"As the EIB has a high degree of creditworthiness, it can acquire cheap capital from the markets and target it at those areas the EU considers necessary."
"In this way the direct need for financial aid diminishes."
"There is a budget guarantee for those loans for which the EIB is responsible on behalf of the EU, which amounts to 70%."
"Now the matter being raised is the reduction of this figure."
"The Commission is proposing 60%, but the Council has decided on a provisional rate of 65%."
"For that reason, Parliament must first determine its position on what the correct rate should be."
"In determining the percentage figure our starting point is that the EU should bear the principal political risk relating to the financing of projects."
"This means that if the political situation in a country in which a project is to be carried out continues as predicted, there is only a financial risk attached to lending."
"That is normally the responsibility of the party granting the loan."
"In fact, the EU guarantee has also borne part of the financial risk, as these two different factors cannot be clearly distinguished from one another."
"The percentage rate obviously has a bearing on how many loans can be guaranteed by a sum that is contained in the financial perspectives and which is at present EUR 200 million."
"In practice, changing the rate may not have an effect except as a means of regulating the overall amount of loans, as the guarantees do not often have to be paid."
"Mr President, with these remarks I would like to express my support for the reports by Mrs Rühle and Mr Seppänen."
"Mr President, the European Investment Bank' s activities are becoming ever more important, especially now that Eastern and Western Europe are to draw closer to each other."
"Bringing new countries from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean area into the EU, like developing cooperation with other neighbouring countries, is not just a question of reaching good agreements."
"It is at least as much a question of in actual fact developing these countries' societies and economies so that they can manage the new environment they are to be integrated into."
"It is therefore a serious matter that it is now so unclear how much confidence can be placed in the Bank."
"The content and consequences of the EIB' s programmes must be developed in such a way that loans vigorously support the European Union' s political objectives."
"The rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets particularly point out that the Bank' s projects must support important objectives, including the European Parliament' s decisions concerning, for example, the fight against poverty, the defence of democracy and human rights and the protection of the environment."
"Clearly, the European Union must continue to back the EIB and guarantee its loans, especially against political risks."
"We take a favourable view of the desire that now exists to carry out assessments in such a way that differentiation takes place on the basis of how risks and financing opportunities appear in different parts of the world."
"It is also important, however, not only to make improvements to the programmes themselves. Instead, there must also be improved public scrutiny of the Bank' s activities."
"For example, it is important that the Bank should work with clear, assessable objectives so that we might in actual fact ensure that the resources are used efficiently."
"This is also important in order for us to be able to learn from the results of the Bank' s activities and use our analyses to develop activities in the future."
"Many of my colleagues have spoken of the importance of openness."
"I shall just touch briefly upon this issue."
"All EU institutions, like the EIB, must now subject themselves to more stringent monitoring and supervision."
"That is why we are now demanding increased openness."
"It ought to be obvious that both OLAF and the Court of Auditors should have access to all documents which are required for the purposes of good supervision."
"That is the significance of the important amendment No 5, and something which I understand that the Bank has now in fact begun to consider agreeing to."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I should like to thank Mrs Heide Rühle for the excellent teamwork."
"It has been a real pleasure to work together on this matter."
"The European Investment Bank is an important tool in connection with aid to developing countries but, in order to help, the Bank needs loan guarantees provided by the EU."
"The guarantees are necessary if the Bank' s potential is to be used fully."
"I should therefore like to recommend the report, but I also have just a couple of remarks about the Investment Bank."
"Combating fraud, muddle and incompetence in the EU' s systems is incredibly important."
"If we do not overcome the fraudulent use of taxpayers' money, the population of Europe is never going to regard us in a positive light."
"It makes cooperation more difficult."
"Combating fraud is therefore something which should be given the highest priority everywhere."
"This also applies to the Investment Bank."
"In the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have fought a hard struggle over six years to obtain an insight into the Bank' s affairs and, yesterday, we finally got an agreement in regard to supervision of the Bank by the fraud office, OLAF."
"I think, however, that it is incredible that it should have been necessary to exert pressure on the Bank in connection with its guarantees from the EU before it became at all possible to talk with its officials."
"It ought not to have been necessary for us to take steps of that kind."
"I will put it like this: it would have been easier to enter Fort Knox in the United States than it was to enter the doors of the Investment Bank."
"The fact that the Bank has now been opened up means that OLAF can ask for information from the Bank."
"It also means that the Bank should turn to OLAF whenever it discovers fraud. Then, things will really have started to move."
"Basically, the Investment Bank has now undertaken to cooperate to the maximum with OLAF in order to get to grips with fraud involving taxpayers' money."
"The only way in which we can obtain a better relationship with the population of Europe is by being open and showing that we are using their money honestly and properly."
"The Bank has therefore decided that OLAF must begin an investigation when it comes to the matter of EU resources."
"This is in actual fact a tremendous victory for Parliament, and I therefore want to say that it has been a pleasure for me to lead this struggle. Now, my colleague can take over, and I am quite sure that he will be a very popular man throughout the Bank."
"Mr President, I would like to make two comments, one concerning the main objective of the subject of today' s debate, the guarantee by Union budgets of the external loans of the EIB, and another on the issues which I know concern this Parliament especially, those of transparency and the efficient use of the Bank' s resources."
"First point: In the ECOFIN of 8 November, a political agreement was reached on the Commission' s proposal of 23 April."
"It is true that the Member States still have some reservations."
"With the favourable opinion of the European Parliament we hope to approve this Council decision in the next meeting of the Council on the 29th of this month."
"The issue is especially relevant, given its urgency, insofar as we do not have a lot of time to implement the new procedure, since the current system ends at the end of January and we need to reach a bilateral agreement between the Bank and the Commission."
"Therefore I would like to thank you for the work on the budget, especially Mrs Rühle, for her invaluable cooperation on this specific issue of the forecast of the issues."
"Having said this, I would also like to tell her that, with regard to the report, many issues have been accepted, while others we have not been able to accept for either technical or economic reasons."
"Our positions are perfectly well known and I do not know if it is worth repeating them."
"I would simply insist perhaps on the last proposal, which refers to amendment 11."
"As we have already told you, we think that it is much better, on the subject of the definition of policies, to speak of a solution by means of a Commission declaration to the Council rather than a modification of the decision."
"However the problem which has been of most concern in today' s debate is that of transparency and the efficient use of Community resources."
"It is clearly not a new issue and many of you have worked on it for many years, and I would like to be a little less negative than some of you."
"Less negative in the sense that the framework of EIB relations with OLAF and the Court of Auditors is beginning to become clearer."
"It is true - and some of you have said so - that, with regard to relations with the Court of Auditors, there is a problem of primary legislation which will clearly have to be amended, if the European Investment Bank is receive the same treatment as the Community institutions."
"I insist once again that this issue is well-known, but no less important for being so: the Member States are the Bank' s shareholders and the Member States must take some decisions which, logically, do not correspond to other Community institutions."
"We are not talking about a greater or lesser degree of representation but rather simply a distribution of competences which at the time were defined in a particular way."
"Secondly: Having said that, in what respect do I believe we have moved forward?"
"I believe that we have moved forward greatly in the sense that the European Investment Bank has accepted that OLAF has all the information and means necessary to analyse the loans subsidised with Community funds, which must undoubtedly be our main concern."
"It is true that we are still debating what will happen to the Bank' s activities in the cases where it uses own resources."
"And when we talk of own resources we are in fact talking about two different realities: loans with own resources and guarantees from the Union or loans without guarantees from the Union."
"I would like this principle of openness which has developed in relations with the Bank to move forward and that finally we may arrive at a result which is satisfactory to the Parliament and the European Investment Bank, without forgetting, as I said before, that the EIB is a financial institution which can provide information with no restriction on any kind of issue."
"It can provide information, with some restriction, to OLAF and, of course, with regard to the Court of Justice, the final position will have to be that which is decided in accordance with the amendment of the Treaties."
"In any case, the debate has been enormously interesting and I hope that what I have heard today will not be an obstacle, however, so that we can move forward with the approval of the distribution of resources, the distribution of loans, as from next year and that Community procedures are not delayed."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"EIB loans to Turkey"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0054/99) by Mr Seppänen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the Proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects for the reconstruction of the earthquake-stricken areas of Turkey (COM(1999) 498 - C5-0247/1999 - 1999/0212(CNS))."
"Mr President, in August Turkey experienced an earthquake which caused much destruction and suffering."
"In fact, we could describe it as a seismic storm, which is still affecting Turkey."
"It has been a time of insecurity there since August."
"The European Parliament has debated the issue of Turkey a good deal."
"At the Helsinki summit in December, Turkey will apparently become a candidate for membership, and it is expected to meet the EU membership criteria laid down at Copenhagen."
"We have often criticised Turkey here."
"We all know the problem regarding democracy in Turkey, which is the Kurdish problem."
"There are millions of people in the country who do not enjoy full political rights, and one of their leaders is awaiting execution in prison."
"There are other problems too, such as Cyprus."
"While discussing this report we have to set aside all the political problems."
"It is a question of humanitarian assistance to Turkey to repair the destruction caused by a mighty natural disaster."
"We should only be talking about how Turkey can be helped, and help is urgently needed."
"That is why the European Parliament must decide on the issue tomorrow."
"The Commission is proposing, at the request of the Council, that a decision be made to grant a loan to Turkey of EUR 600 million out of EIB funds, in accordance with the bank' s normal lending criteria."
"The bank has looked into Turkey' s ability to accept the loan and use the money to repair the damage caused by the earthquake."
"Turkey has the facilities for doing so."
"They are prepared to spend the money specifically on repairing the damage caused by the earthquake."
"The European Parliament is being asked to draft a report on the matter fast, as the EIB is ready to lend EUR 180 million this year already."
"For the purpose of the loan we have to activate the sum of EUR 16.4 million from the common guarantee reserves and transfer it into the guarantee fund for external action."
"The Committee on Budgets, for its part, has prepared the ground for a swift transfer of funds from the guarantee reserves to the guarantee fund headings in the budget according to normal procedure."
"In this connection there is a problem with regard to the competence of the various EU bodies, which has nothing to do with earthquake aid for Turkey."
"We are all unanimous on the need for humanitarian assistance, and we consider the Council' s decision to designate for that purpose EUR 600 million out of EIB funds to be the right one."
"The emerging problem concerns the narrow framework imposed by the interinstitutional agreement on guarantees from the guarantee fund."
"The annual maximum amount the guarantee fund can cover is EUR 200 million."
"At present, the general figure of 70% is granted to the EIB; in the Council they have already agreed to lowering it to 65%, and Parliament, in connection with Mrs Rühle' s report, may approve its further reduction to 60%, as proposed by the Commission."
"For these reasons, I have recommended three amendments to the Commission' s proposal, the first of which concerns the general ceiling for the guarantee fund, and the two others the reconciliation of the guarantee percentage rate with Mrs Rühle' s report."
"Over the years to come, we will have a problem if the especially large credit being granted to Turkey that we are discussing accounts for so large a proportion of the guarantee fund that it eats into the fund for loans granted for other comparable unexpected emergencies."
"As a result, we should reach an agreement with the Commission so that it would propose raising the guarantee fund ceiling in case there are new, unexpected aid requirements in respect of humanitarian disasters such as the one now being discussed."
"I have communicated this by way of a report to the Commission, and I hope they will give their replies today to the questions contained in it."
"The Commission is being asked to explain how the guarantee fund is generally used, and give a more detailed prognosis of the future use of marginals in reserves."
"Depending on their replies, the Committee and Parliament may deem it necessary to propose an amendment, in which the Commission will be reminded that it may revise the excessiveness threshold in the financial perspectives."
"This amendment may be adopted should the Commission's reply prove unsatisfactory."
"In my opinion, it is now time for the Commission to respond to the views expressed in the report."
"Thank you, Mr Seppänen, for your presentation and your report."
"I would like to make a few comments about your report."
"Firstly - and here I would like to address Mr Korakas' concerns - we are talking of humanitarian aid, of a process which is different to any other Union aid programme, whether a financial protocol or any other type."
"This humanitarian aid was initially granted as a result of the earthquakes which took place in August, but the Commission would also like to extend its scope to the most recent earthquakes which have happened in Turkey."
"We believe that the quantity will not be altered significantly, but we do think that it would be difficult to differentiate between the damage caused by one earthquake or another in a programme of this type."
"Having made these initial comments, I would like to deal with the two problems mentioned in the report."
"The first problem is the risk of exceeding the type or total amount of the loans from the reserves and the loan guarantees."
"According to our information, this is not the case."
"We have carried out a thorough and detailed analysis, and, according to the information available, on the basis of the maximum use envisaged there is still a surplus in 1999 of Euro 33 million, of 8.7 in 2000, of 7 million -approximately- in 2001 and, although it is clear that in 2002 the situation will be completely different, there will also be surpluses in 2003."
"This leads us to believe that there is little sense therefore in modifying the system of reserves at the moment, because this difficulty would only arise in the event that we use the maximum forecast."
"Clearly you may ask me what would happen in the event that new situations such as this one may arise and we have to take further action."
"For this reason the Commission always has the margin to confront this possibility of an increase in the reserve Fund, although we feel that it is not necessary to do so at the moment."
"With regard to the possibility of the 60 or 65%, we could agree with your idea of accepting 60 rather than 65%, which seems to us to be a coherent idea."
"This would require a modification of the regulations which are currently applicable, which in turn would lead to a delay in the decision-making process on humanitarian aid, one of the principal characteristics of which is urgency, so that we may quickly relieve the existing problems in Turkey."
"Therefore I would hope that my explanations are satisfactory, that Parliament may reconsider its requests, that the acceptance of this decision may be dealt with as a matter of the greatest urgency with the guarantee that, if there are financial problems in the future, the Commission would bear in mind the need to go further with regard to the reserve Fund."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"I should like to thank all of you who have waited so long!"
"(The sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, with reference to the Minutes for the sitting of Thursday 18 November, item 11 ""Treaty reforms and the next IGC"" ."
"Amendment No 19 is listed with the amendments adopted under item 11. It consists of an addition to paragraph 19 of the draft resolution."
"Well, this addition has not been included in the version of the text adopted as printed in the ""Texts adopted"" section of the Minutes distributed this morning."
"I should, therefore, like to ask you to amend the ""Texts adopted"" , in accordance with the votes which were taken in yesterday' s sitting."
"We shall check the text in all the language versions and, if there is a mistake, it will of course be corrected."
"It is not a mistake to do with the languages, since the addition is missing in all the language versions."
"It will therefore be corrected, Mr Poos."
"- (DE) Mr President, according to the Minutes, we concluded voting yesterday at 2.35 p.m. whereas according to my records it was 2.45 p.m."
"Irrespective of this, however, I would like to say that we were subject to an inhumane three and a half hour voting procedure on account of some lazy individuals wanting to get away early and we therefore came under extreme pressure."
"I request that this procedure no longer be enforced in future."
"If someone leaves, that is nobody' s fault but their own or, to quote Lenin and Gorbachev, life will punish whoever leaves early."
"That person does not have a majority and will hopefully also be punished by the electorate one day."
"Yes, Mr Posselt, I take note of your comment, and I congratulate the brave people who are here this morning."
"Mr President, on a point of order, or a point of concern almost, a number of Members on this side of the House have noticed that you may have lost your jacket and on a snowy day can we offer you one of ours just in case you get cold."
"I shall check the Rules of Procedure to see if the colour and size of jacket are stipulated and I guarantee that I shall adhere to these conditions in future."
"On the subject of yesterday' s Minutes, Mr President."
"Yesterday, before the vote on the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, I made a protest because the amendments that I had submitted in French were not identical to the French version which was officially published."
"It was not, therefore, a translation problem."
"My amendments had actually been reworked by an anonymous reviser."
"Well, I read in the Minutes that the President explained to Mr Berthu that two of his amendments had not been very well worded."
"It sounds as if I worded my amendments badly."
"Well I disagree, my amendments were very well worded, and some anonymous reviser has taken it upon himself to amend the text."
"I must protest. It is a matter of principle."
"The officials of the European Parliament have no call to be altering amendments submitted by a Member of Parliament."
"I take good note of your comment, and the correction you wish will be made."
"Are there any other comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Vote"
"Mr President, this is an additional amendment which, in our opinion, specifies the role and the help that therapeutical communities can give more clearly."
"I will read the Italian text out for the Members: ""believes that rehabilitating drug addicts constitutes, in the same way as other areas, a fundamental aspect of the fight against drugs, in that action is targeted at demand; to this end, it supports and encourages the important social contribution as regards rehabilitating drug addicts on the part of the therapeutical communities, whose means should be increased"" ."
"Are there any objections to this oral amendment being included?"
"(Parliament gave its assent to including the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0050/1999) by Mr Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the improved exchange of information to combat counterfeit travel documents (8457/1999 - C5-0011/1999 - 1999/0804(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0051/1999) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe and Western Balkans, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia, and the Republic of South Africa) (COM(1999) 142 - C5-0039/1999 - 1999/0080(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0054/1999) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects for the reconstruction of the earthquake-stricken areas of Turkey (COM(1999) 498 - C5-0247/1999 - 1999/0212(CNS))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the spring we approved a ceiling for transfers of relevant funds to the guarantee fund."
"Later, in the summer, something unexpected happened: the earthquake in Turkey."
"We quite rightly decided to grant humanitarian assistance to Turkey via the European Investment Bank."
"But that will cause a technical problem with the budget, because now, as a result of this unexpected event, we are approaching the ceiling that has been imposed for such transfers to the guarantee fund."
"If anything else should occur unexpectedly, we will either have to exceed the ceiling or make cuts in other areas of financial aid."
"We have brought this problem to the attention of the Commission and received a very vague reply from them to the questions we asked, but, despite that, we cannot jeopardise the implementation of this financial aid."
"It will be jeopardised if we now adopt the proposed amendments."
"For this reason, although the Commission has not given us a completely satisfactory reply regarding the technical aspects of the budget, I wish to withdraw these amendments, and at the same time I would say to the Commission that there is a problem here, which we have drawn attention to, and we hope that in the future the Commission will take account of it and propose the ceiling be exceeded in the event of unexpected situations in which funding is required."
"Does the Commission wish to make a comment?"
"Mr President, I shall pass on Mr Seppänen' s comments to my colleagues, and I assure you we will discuss the matter."
"The amendments are therefore withdrawn, at the request of the rapporteur."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Giannakou-Koutsikou Report"
"Mr President, in my opinion it is vital to make the prevention of drug dependence a main priority in the EU' s internal and external action."
"That must also be clearly evident from Union acts."
"The rules will, however, be useless unless they are actually effective."
"Therefore it is essential to focus both on cooperation between developing and industrialised countries and on networking among the countries of the EU."
"There is no lack of excellent plans and programmes within the EU."
"Examples we could mention are the drug prevention group in Finland that operates under the supervision of the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health, and the Pompidou Group, a European Council cooperation group on drugs that was established in the 1970s on an initiative by the French President and that is planning several projects to reduce the supply and demand of drugs."
"Now we also need a strong and clearly expressed political will to render the exchange and comparison of information as efficient as possible."
"We will not achieve results merely through acts and plans, but it is through practical action that we can maximise the welfare of our people."
"Mr President, following the adoption of the amendment tabled by Mr Lisi from the Group of the European People' s Party, who was elected from the Forza Italia lists, I have greater satisfaction in giving my explanation of vote, having voted for this measure."
"Therapeutical communities are certainly extremely important."
"As for my reasons for signing this as the pensioners' representative, I have to say that, unfortunately, we rarely find pensioners who are drug-addicts, because young people die prematurely from this terrible scourge."
"I would like to emphasise that this measure is very positive, but we must be the first to set young people an example, because only examples that lead them back to the family unit and to the sound principles of yesteryear will overcome the scourge of this century."
"- (DE) Mr President, I, along with many of my colleagues, have approved Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou' s report."
"It should be emphasised here this morning, though, that controversial discussions on this report have been held in this House for months."
"In committee alone, there have been 130 amendments to this report."
"Weeks of compromise discussions were needed and such a report is then voted on here on a Friday morning with a relatively modest number of people present."
"As I listened to the debates here yesterday, in particular the comments of Mr Poettering, as to how dramatic and important it all now was and saying that a vote definitely had to be taken here this week, that is not now borne out by the presence of his own group here this morning."
"I therefore regret that a procedure as important as this should enjoy such limited attention."
"What is even more splendid is when the authors of this matter become embroiled in intensive talks afterwards."
"In any case, we have given our approval so that Mrs Giannakou-Koutsikou can then see the report home with an extensive majority."
"I have voted against the Giannakou-Koutsikou report."
"It is a very lengthy document which represents all shades of opinion and contains a multitude of considerations and objectives."
"It gives enormous scope."
"It is opposed to trafficking and profiteers, rightly so."
"It endeavours to help people fight their addiction, again rightly so."
"But this means that it is spreading itself rather thinly and the thrust of the document is that with more funding and tougher prosecution, we can knock the problem on the head."
"Quite interestingly, Mr Schulz' s proposal to give urban and regional experiments more of a chance, has been rejected."
"I fear that this text will now be used incorrectly, namely to support those, in particular, who advocate more repression against drug users and think that they will solve the problem in this way."
"As such, the PPE viewpoint has, in principle, dominated after all and this was a reason for me not to go along with it."
"- (PT) Each Member State has a crucial role in defining its policy on combating drug addiction."
"We feel that we are upholding a policy which genuinely attacks its causes and effectively combats drug trafficking and the associated money laundering."
"We are also upholding a policy that does not penalise those who suffer from drug addiction or their families, who should be supported by means of adequate public services, which are free, in terms of treatment and reintegration into society."
"But the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering also requires action and coordination at EU level (and at UN level) in the fight that must be developed against powerful criminal organisations which, through illegal activities and money, undermine and tap into the economic and financial system."
"In order to achieve this, we need a genuinely ""strong political will, expressed without any ambiguity"" . We also need to turn words into deeds, by mobilising the necessary Community financial resources to combat this tragic situation that affects thousands of drug addicts and their families."
"We cannot continue to reduce ""social costs"" in order to meet the criteria imposed on national budgets by the Stability Pact, whilst repeating fine words about social support that are then never actually put into practice."
"We are convinced that if it has adequate resources, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction based in Lisbon can make a major contribution to deepening the study and the proposals for measures to combat the scourge of drugs."
"- (DE)Briefly, I would like to have it put on record that our Group has rejected the Newton Dunn report on account of the fact we did not agree with the legal basis to this report."
"What we have here is a classic ruling on the establishment of a process in one of the various pillars of our Treaty principles. Mr Newton Dunn chose the first pillar whereas we were of the opinion that the procedure should be left in the third pillar."
"The reason for this is that in the third pillar the group of offenders who are guilty of counterfeiting travel documents is more wide-ranging than in the first pillar where Mr Newton Dunn had established it, where the focus is exclusively on the tracking of the counterfeiting of documents for illegal immigrants."
"That may be appropriate from the ideological viewpoint but is politically wrong because someone who, as a drugs dealer, counterfeits documents must also be criminally prosecuted."
"In this respect, we did not want to vote against Mr Newton Dunn' s practical proposals with regard to the combating of document counterfeiting - which we support - as far as we are concerned it is exclusively a matter of the legal basis."
"Thank you for your attention."
"I would also like to thank Messrs Poettering and Pirker for their attention."
"Mr President, I would like to explain the vote in favour of the Newton Dunn report by highlighting that, with its provisions, it fits into the fight against illegal immigration and the numerous criminal acts committed by many illegal immigrants, whether purposefully or not, to the detriment of all the citizens in the European Union, particularly the elderly."
"I would nevertheless like to draw your attention to the fact that it would be a good idea for all the expenditure, all the personnel and all the means used in the past to supervise the borders within the European Union - for example, between Italy and France, France and Germany etc., that is, between the European States which now have a common border - to be relocated to the external borders of the European Union in order to combat this phenomenon of crime and illegal immigration more effectively."
"Mr President, I would like to take the floor regarding the Giannakou-Koutsikou report, in order to remind you that yesterday the Presidency was informed that that this debate would be opened contrary to the provisions of Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I am only saying this so that it will be recorded in the Minutes."
"This Presidency does not know what to do with these Rules of Procedure any more."
"I hope that, at least in the future, some sort of order can be re-established; if this is not the case, then tell us clearly that Parliament' s work is in the hands of the Presidency and not the Rules of Procedure."
"In any case, the fact remains that the debate and the vote have taken place contrary to Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure, in that the last French version was distributed at 9.52 p.m. on Wednesday, and we opened the debate well before the 24 hours had passed."
"Mr Turco, your comment will of course be noted, but the sessional services inform me that the deadlines were, in principle, respected, and that all the language versions were distributed in due time, but we have taken note of your comment."
"Mr President, I did not ask a question and did not want a reply."
"I simply protested that Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure was not complied with."
"I do not need a reply because this has already happened and can no longer be prevented."
"You did not comply with Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure, full stop."
"This has all been noted, Mr Turco."
"Application of Community law to the Canary Islands"
"The next item is the report (A5-0053/1999) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1911/1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands (COM(1999) 0226 - C5-0127/1999 - 19990111(CNS))"
"Mr President, the Commission has presented a proposed regulation intended to amend another Community regulation, Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which established a special legal status for the Canary Islands."
"Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 is in turn a regulation which amends the statute established for these islands by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community in 1985."
"The Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community - in article 25 and in Protocol 2 annexed to that Act - provided the Canary Islands with a special status which was designed to reflect the fact that those islands were not integrated into the Common agricultural policy and, furthermore, because it was not subject to the Community Customs Union, the Community customs rules, nor Value Added Tax."
"In this way, the Act of Accession intended to maintain as far as possible the special status which the Canary Islands had had within the Spanish State since their incorporation into the Kingdom of Castile in the 15th Century."
"It was a region which was not subject to the ordinary tax regime nor, therefore, the customs rules, owing to its great distance from Peninsular Spain."
"The Act of Accession of 1985 contained a future development clause - section 4 of article 25 - which was aimed at preventing the Canary Islands, as a result of European Union development, from being excluded from European construction."
"I would say that public opinion in the Canary Islands was, on the one hand, in favour of maintaining this special status but, on the other hand, had no desire whatsoever to remain outside the sphere of European construction."
"When the Single Act was adopted in 1986, it became necessary to amend that special status and this was done by means of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91."
"That amendment establishes three or four very important changes: firstly, the Canary Islands were incorporated into the Common agricultural policy and the Common fisheries policy; secondly, they were incorporated into the Community Customs Union, and are therefore subject to ordinary customs duties; and thirdly, it removed the special tax rules which they had, specifically the island taxes - the so-called special licence tax arrangements - which were designed to protect local industry."
"Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 has led to the progressive dismantling of the Canary Islands' special tax rules and their incorporation into the Community' s common rules."
"But this has caused difficulties, because the problem with the Canary Islands, as with the other outermost regions - the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments - is that they are a long way from European territory, divided into small island areas, with very small markets, with enormous transport problems and, furthermore, with problems due, for example, to over-population, very irregular rain patterns and poor soil, which hinder the development of normal activities."
"This explains why, in the past, the Canary Islands always enjoyed a special status within Spain."
"The dismantling of the Canary Islands' special tax status, in terms of customs duties, would threaten to dismantle a series of small local industries - food, tobacco and small commercial industries - which would disappear if we were to remove that small degree of protection provided by their special taxes, specifically the tax on production and imports."
"The Commission has been thorough and has taken account of this, and has therefore begun a negotiation of an adaptation of the tax on production and imports, in order that that tax may not disappear."
"There has also been another issue: the Treaty of Maastricht of 1992 included a declaration recognising the special status of the outermost regions - the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments - and section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, after its amendment by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, provides for special status for the outermost regions."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is now in force."
"In accordance with the thinking behind the new status for the outermost regions - which was also confirmed by the Cologne European Council which asked the Commission to present measures for the outermost regions before 31 December - at the moment the incorporation of these regions into the European Union does not necessarily require tax and customs harmonisation, but rather allows differentiated treatment, for example the maintenance of the port charges in the French overseas departments and the special rules for the Azores and Madeira."
"Although the Commission' s proposed regulation began to be negotiated before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Committee on Legal Affairs - which in general approves the proposed regulation, since it is aimed at delaying the removal of the Canary Islands' taxes and therefore plays a protective role - we believe that, after the entry into force of article 299.2, rather than a simple easing of the limits of the special treatment, we need to paralyse the removal of this special treatment because it is possible that, in the measures which the Commission must propose for the outermost regions in accordance with the said article 299.9, which provides for special measures in the field of fiscal policy, the Commission may allow a limited reinstatement so that the relevant small local industries do not suffer."
"As I said before, Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously approved the regulations, but proposes a series of amendments intended to indicate that article 299.2, which is already in force, establishes an additional basis for the Commission' s proposed regulation."
"We are not trying to oppose the Commission' s regulation, which establishes an additional basis."
"That additional basis would justify a measure which one could describe as containing and detaining the removal of customs duties."
"As a consequence of that reference to article 299.2 and the thinking which I am explaining at the moment, the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed a series of amendments to the annexes of the regulation to halt the removal of customs duties in any of the areas where they are currently in force."
"It is a question of maintaining the current protectionist structure of the taxes until the Commission presents its new proposals in the field of tax policy."
"As the Commissioner knows, next week in Brussels a partnership meeting will take place in which the Commission will discuss the proposals with the governments of France, Spain and Portugal, the governments of the Autonomous Regions and the MEPs from those regions."
"Therefore, it would seem appropriate that the Commission approve and express its agreement with Parliament' s proposals - the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs - which are very reasonable and are in accordance with the Commission' s thinking but reinforce it by referring to the new article 299.2, which will provide for and allow the development of a special status."
"It does not make much sense now to totally remove the system when in a few months it is possible that the Commission will have to propose its reinstatement."
"This is the thinking, this is the problem, and I hope that Parliament will follow the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs, approve the regulation and also approve the 19 amendments which the said Committee has proposed."
"Good morning, Mr President."
"Firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Members who have presented amendments."
"I believe that the words of Mr Medina Ortega have clarified the approach and position which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has agreed unanimously, on this essential issue, an issue which is important for the Canary Islands, but which affects all the other outermost regions of the European Union."
"With reference to the subject of today' s debate, the Canary Islands, I must say that few regions have lived or are living through such an intense process of European integration."
"Since their incorporation in 1986, the Canary Islands have held significant and intense debates."
"There have been public demonstrations for and against the full incorporation of the islands, there have been governmental crises and even the resignation of the President of an autonomous government, the specific cause of which was the conditions for the accession negotiations."
"After thirteen years, it is time to make an assessment."
"To this end the regulation which we are debating at the moment in Parliament is very useful, since from this assessment we can reach conclusions which will allow us to determine the position we must take."
"The assessment is clearly positive, although we must recognise that there are enormous worries and concerns attached to it, as the rapporteur has explained effectively."
"These concerns stem from what we are debating here, but also from other issues which are being studied and dealt with by this Parliament."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that at the moment in the Canaries there is a lot of uncertainty with regard to the future of bananas, since the Canary Islands are Europe' s top producer of that fruit, which is so important from economic, social, scenic and environmental points of view."
"However - and I repeat - today we are talking about Regulation 1911/91 concerning the application of Community Law to the Canary Islands."
"The arguments and explanations which the rapporteur has given us today are clear and describe the long journey made by the Canary Islands to arrive at the process of incorporation into the European Union."
"Nevertheless it is essential in our opinion that this reform is carried out within the time frame laid down."
"This is an absolutely essential issue."
"We should remember the mandate of the Cologne European Council to the Commission; we should remember that before the end of 1999 there was supposed to be specific and special treatment which has still not happened; we should remember that at the moment we are debating the Commission' s legislative agenda for 2000."
"It is important that in this legislative agenda we include the special treatments laid down in article 299.2 of the EC Treaty for the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, because, otherwise, we would reach a situation or position in which these European regions, which are vital to each of the Member States and to the European Union, are put at an absolute disadvantage in relation to the European Union as a whole."
"To end, I would like to say that our Group supports the 19 amendments and the legislative text, but asks that we do not proceed to a second reading, but that this regulation be approved within the time limits laid down."
"We ask the Commission to be sensitive to the rapporteur' s views, to the views of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that, please, the regulation be approved within the envisaged time limits because, otherwise, the situation in the Canary Islands would be of great concern."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor at this point to express my support, and that of the Socialist Group, for the work and the conclusions regarding the proposals presented today to this Parliament, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, by my good friend and colleague Professor Manuel Medina, in the well-founded hope that this Assembly will fully approve the proposals in question."
"Of course our intention is not simply to support a colleague."
"In reality our position - now through this intervention and later through our vote - is that of Spaniards and Europeans, and perhaps even more as Spanish and European Socialists, who are expressing their solidarity with the Canary Islands and their men and women."
"I am speaking of a solidarity which the Canary Islands require in a specific and particular way, precisely because of the specific and particular characteristics of their geography and history."
"Let it be clear therefore that what we want is to give a little more to the Canaries, to compensate for adverse conditions, and thereby prevent a situation where they have a little less than the other Europeans."
"The rapporteur, Manuel Medina, has explained in a rigorous and full way the legal arguments which explain how the Canaries has been defended for centuries, within a Spanish context, by means of different mechanisms which allowed those distant islands to overcome the negative circumstances which I spoke of earlier, and, with the skill, tenacity and efforts of their men and women, firstly resist and then gradually build reasonably modern and prosperous societies."
"We were aware of the problems of the Canary Islands when we negotiated the accession of our country to the European Community and the successive Treaties, up until Amsterdam, and the constant concern to always take that special situation into account was reflected in the special Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, back in 1985, in Council Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which approved the said Protocol, and in section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, which describes the outermost regions of the Union, with special mention of the Canary Islands and lays down the very flexibility in the application of general rules in certain vulnerable cases which we are discussing today."
"It was precisely Protocol 2, which I referred to earlier, which, applying traditional formulas to the new rules, established the so-called ""APIM"" (Tax on Production and Exports), a modest duty applied to certain products entering the Canary Islands, many of which originate from the Spanish Peninsular and others from other States."
"At the moment there is a process under way which will lead to the negotiation between the Spanish Government and the Commission, with a view to amending the said Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which specifically regulates the APIM in question."
"The concern which this amendment has caused in the Canary Islands - and which we are recognising here - has increased as a result of a certain lack of confidence in the ability of the government of my country to appreciate the true nature and gravity of this problem and in its desire to tackle that problem in the said negotiation with the Commission."
"In reality there are only three alternatives."
"The first is the complete removal of the APIM, which would have very negative effects for the many small and medium-sized businesses on the islands which, although they make little profit from their production, survive thanks to the fact that similar products arriving from outside are taxed, and it is therefore still viable to continue producing them in the Canaries."
"The second alternative is less harsh but ultimately just as harmful."
"It would consist of eliminating the APIM gradually until it disappears completely after a few years, perhaps maintaining them partially for a few products."
"The third solution is the one which Professor Medina proposes and which we understand that the Canary Islands requires and wants, the one which this Parliament will probably vote for in a few moments."
"Based on the legal considerations of the EC Treaty, we argue that the APIM be kept as it is for now, and that it be consolidated within the obligatory reform of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91."
"We hope that this Parliament is up to the job and does not disappoint our fellow citizens ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, for five centuries of European history, the Canary Islands have always enjoyed special consideration in terms of shaping their presence in the Spanish and European worlds."
"In fact, when the Kingdom of Spain acceded to the European Community in 1985 the door was left open for an amendment of the status of the European model for the Canary Islands."
"In 1991, when Regulation 1911/91 was approved, we experienced Community adaptation with regard to the application of the provisions of Community Law in the islands."
"At that point a transitional period of ten years was set so that the integration of the economy of the Canary Islands into the Community would not be traumatic for some local production sectors and, de facto, amongst other things, a tax on production and imports, the APIM, was established with a view to protecting the integration of small basic Canary Island industries into the Community Customs Area."
"The said tax, which protected local industry in relation to imported goods, would be gradually dismantled between 1995 and the end of 2000."
"Curiously, this removal of the APIM has not had the desired effect amongst the sensitive industries in the Canary Islands and therefore the Spanish authorities, the Canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested that the Community authorities amend Regulation 1911/91 in order to stop the removal of the APIM until June 2000, which the European Commission appreciates."
"Nevertheless, some of us, as Members from the Canary Islands, as well as considering it reasonable to extend the validity of this tax in accordance with the Commission' s proposal, have requested by means of amendments that it affect the most sensitive products, all the sensitive products produced in the Canary Islands."
"We also request that this customs approach be applied to a new tax with a structure similar to the old APIM, with the aim of incorporating it into a package of specific measures of a fiscal nature which the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, must implement next year - as Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Medina Ortega have just said - by means of the proposed permanent statute for the outermost regions - which include the Canary Islands - in implementation of article 299.2, which provides for differentiated treatment, as you know, with regard to the application of the provisions of the Treaty."
"This very week the Autonomous Parliament of the Canary Islands, during a political debate on this issue, unanimously approved an agreement which includes fiscal measures and asks Europe to provide for the establishment of a tax similar to the APIM."
"Congratulations to Mr Medina Ortega on his report and on his receptiveness to the amendments presented."
"I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Medina Ortega on his report on the proposal for a regulation concerning the Canary Islands."
"Following its examination of the APIM/Arbitrio on production and imports in the Archipelago, the Commission concluded that even if the majority of economic sectors could adapt to the requirements of the single market, the disappearance of the APIM on 31 December 2000 could irremediably affect certain product sectors."
"This point has already been made in this House."
"The Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish and the Canarian authorities, has identified the most sensitive products in a number of sectors."
"For these products the Commission considers it necessary to suspend the dismantling of the tax for a transitional period which will not go beyond 30 June 2000."
"I note with satisfaction that Mr Medina Ortega's report largely supports the approach proposed by the Commission."
"However, he considers it regrettable that the measure proposed is reserved to a limited number of products and that it does not refer to the legal basis provided by Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"I can assure you that the Commission understands this position perfectly."
"I would like nevertheless to draw your attention to the fact that this constitutes a time-limited adaptation of the current rules."
"It must therefore be distinguished from any measure which could be taken on the basis of the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"This proposal stipulates that the Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish authorities will examine before the disappearance of the APIM the effects of this tax on the sectors concerned."
"The Commission will submit, if necessary, a proposal to the Council based on Article 299(2) on the measures which would be necessary in order not to compromise the existence of certain particularly fragile local activities."
"The products included in the annex to this proposal are the result of work by the Spanish and the Canarian authorities and the Commission."
"Consequently, any amendment to the list of the products must, on the one hand, be justified economically and, on the other hand, be subject to a study by the Commission services in order to check the consistency of the measures with its other policies."
"The Commission has not yet received such justification which would enable it to study an amendment to the Regulation's annex."
"It is not therefore in a position to accept those amendments concerning the extension of the list of the products."
"However, I can assure both you, Mr President, and the rapporteur that in future negotiations on a proposal concerning the Canary Islands on the basis of Article 299(2) of the Treaty that the Commission will take account of your comments on the matter and the comments of Parliament during the debate."
"I wish to thank you for your support for this proposal and I will undertake to draw the attention of the Commissioner responsible to this whole debate."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the draft legislative resolution)"
"Shipbuilding"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the shipbuilding industry."
"The Council Regulation of 29 June 1998 stipulates that: ""The Commission shall present to the Council a regular report on the market situation and appraise whether European yards are affected by anti-competitive practices."
"If it is established that the industry is being caused injury by anti-competitive practice of any kind, the Commission shall, where appropriate, propose to the Council measures to address the problem."
"The first report shall be presented to the Council no later than 31 September 1999"" ."
"In line with this requirement the Commission prepared its first report which concludes that the shipbuilding industry in the global market is facing serious over-capacity problems."
"The situation continues to deteriorate as capacities continue to grow, competition is becoming stronger and prices fall."
"The report examines in detail nine contracts awarded to Korean shipyards and finds that none is concluded at prices covering full costs and that injury is caused to EU yards."
"The report suggests that action should be taken by Member States and the IMF World Bank fora in order to verify whether the conditions and assumptions under which the IMF-led rescue package was given to Korea are fully respected in the case of shipyards."
"The industry, Member States and the Commission should collect all the necessary information that could form a basis for the preparation and lodging of a trade barrier regulation complaint and assess the appropriateness of resorting to a WTO action, the Commission should continue its market monitoring efforts in cooperation with the industry and, finally, all parties concerned should make an effort to establish a level playing field for the sector."
"The Industry Council discussed the Commission's report at its meeting of 9 November 1999 and issued a Council conclusion on the situation in world shipbuilding."
"It shares the Commission's view on the critical situation of the shipbuilding sector worldwide and calls for continuing action to address the situation."
"Following the Council meeting, bilateral discussions have been held with the Korean Government at the level of the Korean Deputy Minister for Trade Affairs and the corresponding officials in the Directorate-General for enterprise and the Directorate-General for trade."
"A bilateral meeting of the Korean and the EU industry and administration is under preparation for mid-December 1999."
"The intention is to organise a meeting on shipbuilding in the context of the OECD."
"The Commission will continue its own monitoring efforts with the help of the industry and will collate and evaluate all the information and evidence collected, in line with the Council's conclusion."
"If necessary, further meetings will take place."
"The Commission will present its findings to the Industry Council and to the European Parliament in the spring of next year."
"My colleagues, Mr Lamy and Mr Solbes Mira are cooperating closely with me on this issue."
"On the basis of this report the appropriate action will have to be decided."
"- (DE) Mr President, Mr Liikanen, please listen to the case I am about to make."
"The Council of Ministers for Industry met on 9 November and I made the following comments in this regard at home. Europe has finally found strong words but deeds must now follow."
"We are now giving a clear signal to South Korea to abandon unfair methods of competition in shipbuilding."
"We will not accept domestic, i.e. European, shipbuilding being driven out of the market by unfair practices after it has been painstakingly modernised."
"In Germany alone, 21,000 jobs are threatened in shipbuilding along with 125,000 more in the supply sector."
"The irony of the situation lies, above all, in the fact that the hidden subsidies were facilitated by credits from the International Monetary Fund to surmount the financial crisis in the Far East."
"Mr Liikanen, following the interesting report from the Commission of 13 October, the shipyard action day, Europe, through the Council of Ministers for Industry, has given Korea a yellow card."
"Any continuation of Korean dumping practices must be punished with a sending off."
"The European shipbuilding industry finds itself in a serious crisis, one that has not just come about today."
"An urgent decision must now be taken as to whether to support shipbuilding in Europe and in so doing support the preservation of the entire maritime industry or to leave this hi-tech branch of industry to others."
"There can only be one answer to this: a clear declaration of our belief in European shipyards."
"Anyone who has been closely involved with shipbuilding knows that what we are dealing with here today is high technology, a branch of industry which is very much part of the future."
"Europe cannot, and must not, give it up."
"There are also critics, however."
"Firstly, there are those who consider shipbuilding to still be an antiquated heavy industry, whose artificial preservation in Europe would come at too high a price, although a glance at, or visit to, one of the highly productive and efficient European shipyards tells a different story."
"I would be very pleased to arrange visits along these lines because I can tell you that it would be worth it."
"Secondly, shipbuilding is sometimes classified as a hi-tech industry, but then it is implied that shipbuilders are over-dramatising their situation somewhat."
"It is said that they are just after financial benefits at a national and EU level, as happens in other branches of industry."
"Thirdly, Who gets the money?"
"The shipowners or the shipyards?"
"The image of the shipyard has, on the whole, changed dramatically."
"The number of people employed in coastal regions or monopolistic ports that are already depressed has declined dramatically as a result of structural change."
"New technologies, fields of work and areas of management in particular as well as new tasks have overtaken the nostalgic Kon-Tiki and the warship."
"Road to sea transport projects to relieve the traditional road networks require all types of ship, including just in time feeders and modern container ships, rapid ferry-boats and high-speed yachts, multi-purpose ships for the fishing industry and the coast guard service, large and small cruise ships and so on."
"Europe' s maritime know-how in traditional roles and new market segments is a reliable, sustainable and natural resource and thus constitutes an added value for Europe."
"Europe' s medium-sized shipyards, in particular, have developed a high level of inventiveness in this field, but research and development, not just production and acquisition require money, and this is where aid comes in."
"Anyone who knows me knows that I fight furiously against subsidies of all kinds, for distortions of competition follow hard on their heels, as a rule."
"It is not for nothing that I am, in addition, a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It is clear that if Korea continues to act in this way, it will undercut itself and will slide into financial ruin, with only itself to blame."
"Secondly, the Korean economy is part of the global market."
"We are on the verge of new WTO negotiations."
"Thirdly, Korea needs support to lift itself out of national bankruptcy."
"The IMF payments are making a clear statement."
"Fourthly, Europe needs Korea."
"Just look at the order books and the volume of investment, in spite of the worldwide overcapacity which has been mentioned."
"This means that until a trade policy is developed by both Korea and Europe by means of bilateral negotiations and/or multilateral negotiations within the scope of the OECD, IMF and the WTO, as mentioned already by Mr Liikanen, enabling fair competition, we need various measures which are valid for a determined period until the present critical situation has been overcome."
"In my opinion, direct but contract-related support could be part of this, temporarily."
"This is the only instrument that has a direct effect, is transparent and, furthermore, strengthens competition."
"Returning to so-called European individual solutions, on the other hand, can mean that competition inside Europe, in addition, is distorted yet further, as in the past."
"We therefore need a strategy of different approaches."
"We would like to assist the Commission and the Council of Industrial Ministers in this approach with all our strength and energy."
"Commissioner Liikanen, for many years, firstly as a member of the ""economic"" committee and now as a member of the ""industry"" committee, I have been dealing with issues involving the shipbuilding industry."
"More particularly, over the last three years, I have, on several occasions, expressed concern to the Commission about distortions of competition at world level, made worse by the fact that Europe has always set itself strict standards which our competitors prefer to ignore."
"What is more, in many cases the only response I received from the Commissioners and their departments was a blunt refusal to acknowledge the problem."
"The Commission seems now to have become aware of the situation, and I am delighted to see this because, while one may regret the thousands upon thousands of jobs in Europe which have been lost in the meantime, as we say in French, ""better late than never"" ."
"Today there no longer seems to be any point in going back over past problems and that is why, this morning, I shall ask you some specific questions about the future which are not just concerned with Korea."
"The first question concerns the United States."
"I have learnt that an American shipyard, one which has not built any vessels for more than forty years, has received the order for two passenger boats intended to serve the islands of Hawaii, since American law reserves the construction of boats serving internal routes for American shipyards."
"What do you plan to do about this?"
"What does the European Union plan to do in order to open up the American market to European products in this field?"
"This is my second question. If my information is accurate, a proportion of the wages of workers involved in the construction of these passenger boats is paid by the United States Navy, on the grounds of the preservation of shipbuilding capacity."
"What do you plan to do, Commissioner, on the matter of this American aid which does not seem to be compatible with the regulations in force in this field?"
"My third question is to do with Korea."
"Since 1997, the Korean Gas Company has been restricting tender competitions for the construction of methane carriers to Korean shipyards only, again constituting, in my opinion, an infringement of the international regulations on the opening up of public procurement."
"I ask you once again, Commissioner, what do you plan to do in order to open up the Korean market and fight against these decisions which do not appear to me to be legal?"
"My fourth question relates to the matter you referred to in your preliminary speech."
"We have learnt or, to be more precise, we have received confirmation that the European Commission had in hand the first part of the report on the market situation drawn up in application of the Council Regulation which you mentioned."
"This report indicates an anti-competitive practice by Korean shipbuilders, of between 13% and 14% of Korean costs of production."
"As you mentioned, the question arises as to who pays the differences observed by the Commission between Korean costs of production and sale prices?"
"The answer seems obvious."
"It is the Korean banking system, supported moreover by the IMF and the Korean State."
"Until now, in spite of a number of reminders in this field, since it is not a new matter, the European Union and the Commission have taken no effective action to put an end to these indirect subsidies in Korea."
"What tangible action do you plan to take today in order to act rapidly?"
"I shall conclude, Commissioner, by telling you that it is true that the European shipbuilding industry still receives aid. Not a lot, but some."
"In any case, it is scheduled that aid for orders will come to an end in December next year and I do not think we can reconcile ourselves to a laissez-faire policy."
"That is why I am asking you, Commissioner, to at last draw up a trade policy worthy of the name."
"That is why I am suggesting that you do not carry on saying, or having people say, that we do not have the instruments which would enable us to defend European jobs better in this sector."
"That is why it is no longer possible to let constraints be placed on Europe which are not placed on our industrial competitors elsewhere in the world, in the shipbuilding sector as in many others."
"That is why, finally, it is time to quite simply have done with the laissez-faire attitude which characterised the Brittan era."
"Are Europe and the new Commission prepared to do so today?"
"Permit me, Commissioner Liikanen, to ask you the question once again."
"Mr President, there has been a lot of criticism here this morning about the fact that contracts have been awarded to Korean companies and the damage that this has done to the European industries."
"However, as in many other areas, the reason that contracts have been awarded to countries like Korea is surely because of the conditions that apply: for example workers in such countries get very low wages, working conditions and safety measures are very poor and unsatisfactory, because the health and safety of workers is not a priority."
"Like in many industrial sectors, businesses are relocating to countries where they can exploit workers to their own advantage."
"This is something that has to be addressed when we talk about, having a level playing field for the sector in Europe; in fact what we need is a level playing field internationally for workers."
"We have to protect workers' rights."
"We cannot exploit workers in some countries while protecting their rights in Europe."
"Someone mentioned the EU imposing stringent measures in this sector in Europe."
"But what should we do?"
"Lift those stringent measures?"
"They were applied for a reason."
"There were reasons for imposing such stringent measures in the first place."
"When it comes to shipbuilding itself, I also think that we need to look at what kind of shipbuilding takes place."
"For example, as regards shipbuilding for the fishing sector, we have an over-capacity of fishing vessels within the European Union, so what kind of vessels should be built?"
"I think that emphasis should be put on the building of coastguard or marine protection vessels to control and monitor the common fisheries policy."
"The vessels being built must support local industry and local coastal fishing."
"Safety must be given priority."
"When it comes to the building of vessels, we must ensure that the most advanced technology is used to ensure that they are as environmentally-friendly as possible."
"A lot of vessels are used for transporting live animals."
"First of all, the export of live animals is unacceptable."
"In fact, it is completely wrong, especially when they are going to be slaughtered."
"The kind of conditions they have to endure in large vessels are not acceptable, so if new vessels are being built we should ensure that the best standards possible are complied with and that measures are taken to ensure that, where live animals must be transported by sea in large vessels, all measures are taken to optimise conditions for them."
"Another issue that has to be looked at in the building of new vessels is the whole issue of waste and waste facilities - and not just the waste derived from the operating vessels but also the waste produced during the trip, because marine pollution is a very important issue and a lot of marine pollution is caused by ships."
"To come back to the issue of dumping vessels discarded within the European Union on other countries, we have to be very careful that we are not dumping unsafe and ecologically unsound vessels on countries at cheap prices."
"This is unacceptable - it is just shifting our problem to other parts of the world, and the marine environment has no borders so anything that happens in one area eventually comes back to roost here."
"The whole issue of unfair competition which people are criticising is caused by the fact that the industry itself is exploiting workers in certain parts of the world."
"This has to stop."
"Mr President, the European Union' s shipbuilding and ship repair industry is facing serious problems, as has been mentioned here, which shows that the recipes provided a few years ago are not giving the promised results."
"The liberalisation of the industry and the policy of privatisation that has been pursued in various countries have not resolved the existing problems."
"In the last two years, the situation has grown worse as a result of constant anti-competitive practices - as has already been mentioned here - particularly on the part of South Korea."
"Employers' organisations and employees' organisations have both drawn attention to the serious consequences of this situation."
"On 5 November, a day of action was held across Europe in which many dockyard workers in Portugal took part."
"From Viana do Castelo to Margueira and Mitrena, via dockyards in the areas of Oporto, Aveiro and Figueira da Foz the workers are demanding a policy of upgrading the shipbuilding industry, of protecting jobs that are stable, worthwhile and that offer proper wages and a policy of promoting the exploitation of existing potential."
"In order to understand the current situation, we must remember that the 1994 international agreement on the elimination of aid for shipbuilding in the context of the liberalisation of the industry is not being fulfilled."
"This agreement should have come into force in 1996, but did not do so because it was not ratified by some countries, notably the United States, which was one of its main proponents but which, in the end, chose to continue supporting its own shipbuilding industry, as has also already been said here."
"Contrary to what the European Council said in 1998, when it drew up the new rules on aid for shipbuilding, conditions of international competition did not, in the end, improve."
"Support for the industry has ceased in the European Union but it has continued and even increased in other countries, amongst which South Korea stands out."
"We know that this country has been concluding contracts at prices that are below the real costs of production, by benefiting from international subsidies via the International Monetary Fund, after the Asian crisis, which is destroying the order books of countries in the European Union, as the industry' s employers' organisations have stated."
"The recent position of the Council on 9 November, despite being too little, too late, naturally shows that the fight put up by the shipbuilding industry is having an effect."
"It is therefore crucial that the Council and the Member States thoroughly examine the measures that are necessary to protect this very important sector of industry in the European Union."
"It is important to promote a policy which will stimulate shipbuilding and ship repair and, as is vital in the case of Portugal, to combine this with renewing merchant navy and fishing fleets and, at the same time, to promote the improvement of the living and working conditions of those involved."
"It is also vital that the Commission makes this problem and its resolution a priority, that it recognises the need to review long-held positions and that it provides the European Parliament with full information on the damage that the European shipping industry has suffered."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the question of shipbuilding must, quite obviously, be tackled comprehensively, taking one area of production at a time."
"The Member States have acknowledged expertise in the field of military shipbuilding."
"This is a field in which the Commission obviously does not have to intervene, but in which intergovernmental cooperation should be stepped up, so that Member States can safeguard and increase their expertise and independence, at acceptable cost."
"It would be very dangerous to allow disinvestment in this field and one can only regret the recent problems afflicting in particular the Horizon frigate programme and the abrupt withdrawal of some partners, which upset the overall balance of the programme."
"As regards the construction of passenger and merchant vessels, both highly competitive, labour-intensive sectors, here too the Member States' remarkable expertise and outstanding capabilities must be protected and developed and not allowed to go outside Europe."
"As regards heavy manufacturing units affected by significant technological developments, Member States must be able to implement a policy fostering the technological conversion of their shipyards, so that the latter can become active in market sectors which allow them to exploit their know-how."
"The closure of any shipyard represents an irreparable loss of expertise for the Member States and for the European Union."
"The Union must not, therefore, on the basis of ill-advised notions of free competition, prevent states from promoting the conversion of manufacturing units with a view to preserving both know-how and jobs."
"In this respect, the example of the shipyards on France' s Atlantic coast, whose brilliant recovery following a period of crisis has been particularly spectacular, and the role the French State played in this process, should be pondered."
"We must be very careful to ensure that the forthcoming WTO negotiations make it possible to put an end to the unacceptable dumping practised by a number of countries and do not endanger a sector in which world competition is intense, since it is highly labour-intensive, difficult to automate, and therefore prey to strong pressure in favour of relocation to countries where labour costs are far lower than those we have in the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, I wish to mention the subject of the construction of fishing boats."
"This sector, which may, in the overall scheme of things, seem a rather marginal one, does however play a crucial role in the balance of the economic and social fabric of our coastal regions."
"The European Community plays an essential role in this field."
"This sector is, in fact, almost totally dependent on the common fisheries policy."
"But for two years now the European Commission has frozen Community aid for the construction of new vessels and, by the same token, that of Member States, until the objectives for the destruction of boats outlined in the multiannual guidance programmes have been reached."
"This deadlock, which has serious consequences, was compounded by a refusal to take the sale of boats to third countries into consideration in calculating the reduction in capacity of the European fleet."
"In considering only the boats destroyed, the Commission is thus behind a considerable loss of earnings to the detriment of fishermen and ship-owners."
"What is more, the Commission is today proposing to prohibit any renewal in the sectors which are not advancing as quickly as others and is making it compulsory to find and destroy any capacity which exceeds by more than 30% the renewed boat capacity in the sectors which are up to date with the MAGP objectives."
"This situation and these proposals entail a worrying ageing of the European fishing fleet, discourage young people from investing their energies in it, cause a significant loss of sales for the specialist shipyard sector, making some of them dangerously vulnerable, and entail a clear risk for our seafarers as far as safety is concerned."
"We hope that the Council will be able to make the Commission see reason and carry through the proposals which the European Parliament made at the time after close consultation with Member States, in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Arias Cañete."
"Whenever a shipyard disappears, particularly valuable know-how built up over time, linked with the seafaring history of a region, disappears along with it."
"Everything must be done to prevent this."
"The Commission must also show consistency."
"After urging the construction of netters, on the grounds of the selectivity of the drift net, the Commission then, under pressure from some lobbies and some Member States, without scientific basis and in a discriminatory fashion, prohibited the use of this same drift net in some seas only."
"It recommended experimenting with alternative gear, but did not envisage a specific financial chapter or a specific kilowatt package enabling boats to be built in line with the new regulations which it had issued."
"Now, it has been confirmed, after analysing the results of the first experiments, that existing netters cannot be adapted to comply with the new conditions, and new boats will have to be built."
"I would therefore be grateful to you, Commissioner Liikanen, if you would point out to your colleague, Mr Fischler, that shipowners are having trouble understanding this logic, or rather this absence of logic."
"The Commission shall obviously have to make the necessary arrangements to enable the construction of ships required by the changes in regulations which it has decided on."
"In conclusion, Mr President, Commissioner, if the European Commission really wishes to make a contribution to the expansion of the shipbuilding sector in Europe, it is enough for it to clearly defend the principle of fair trade at the WTO talks, to leave Member States the freedom to intervene directly in this strategic sector in order to convert shipyards, by means of technological modifications, for activity in profitable market sectors, to promote cooperation between businesses in order to contribute towards improving the overall efficiency of each type of shipyard and, finally, in the context of the common fisheries policy, to take the necessary decisions to enable the controlled renewal of our fishing fleet, the continuation of the expertise of our shipyards and the vitality, Mr President, of our coastal regions which are dependent on fishing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is altogether excellent that the Industry Council at its meeting last week unanimously approved a list of measures to eliminate the situation of unhealthy competition caused by Korea."
"Hopefully these measures will work, as South Korea' s operations really weaken the prospects for success of European shipyards in the face of already intense competition from elsewhere."
"As the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry clearly stated at the meeting, the EU, however, must not give as good as it gets when it comes to South Korea; in other words, it must not return to the idea that it is not prepared to give up its shipyards."
"To borrow the Minister' s words, continuing such support would be tantamount to the EU shooting itself in the foot."
"This is precisely what the South Koreans must be hoping for."
"For a long time now the Commission has aimed to give up shipyard aid in its present form, and this aim should absolutely be maintained."
"The idea is to replace shipyard aid with newly designed investment and environmental aid schemes and grant more aid to research and innovation, which is what Mrs Langenhagen so eloquently spoke about."
"With the new schemes the Commission aspires to support a more environment-friendly, safer European fleet, as was decided in 1997 in connection with the guidelines for state aid for maritime transport."
"I gladly welcome this policy, as long as it is also implemented in practice."
"I would especially like to remind the Commissioner that the Union promised Finland, when we were negotiating membership, that it would take account of our remoteness and climate when deciding its aims for navigation policy for the whole continent."
"In July 1999, the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications notified the Commission of the interest subsidy programme for vessel acquisitions, set up to promote the purchase and basic repair of safe and environment-friendly cargo ships which can sail easily through icy waters, these being essential in Northern Europe."
"There is broad national consensus on the issue in the Finnish Parliament, as shown by the fact that, exceptionally, on its own initiative, the parliament increased powers to solicit acquisitions in the 1999 budget."
"As a former Minister of Finance, Commissioner Liikanen will understand the significance of this."
"Now, however, it would appear that officials in the Commission' s Directorate-General for competition have a firm intention to interpret the programme in question as aid to shipyards, although the programme does not affect the competitive position of shipyards, as a ship receiving aid can be ordered from any country whatsoever."
"This is also what was stated in the Commission' s letter of 4 August 1999 by officials in Directorate-General VII when they pointed out that the aid had no connection with shipyards in the EU."
"I would also like to take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner how the Commission intends to ensure environmentally friendly developments and greater safety in maritime transport in Northern Europe, if it does not allow the implementation of the action framework it created itself."
"Although we have clearly decided to abandon shipyard aid, the recent events in South Korea cannot be allowed to lead to a situation where the Union starts to confuse the old-fashioned shipyard aid with the action based on the 1997 guidelines, which did not relate to competition policy but were purely in line with sustainable development and the 'safety of the seas' doctrine."
"Finally I would ask you, Commissioner Liikanen, how it is possible for a Member State to create a policy on navigation if it cannot trust in the directions given by the Commission?"
"How has the Commission in its recent exchange of letters with the Finnish Government taken account of the protocol on navigational policy in our negotiations for membership?"
"Mr President, I find this debate very depressing because we seem to be covering the same old ground, discussing an issue we have dealt with many times before in this Parliament."
"I find it depressing because I was born in a small port town where, at the time, there was a boatyard on practically every corner."
"They were wooden boats."
"There was a profession, that of boat-builder, which was a proud profession."
"I realise that progress is inevitable and that it is not possible for such a profession to be maintained today, but the situation is alarming."
"The fact that Europe will end up with no shipbuilding industry is worrying."
"It was we Europeans who opened up the world through navigation: the Scandinavians in the North, the Portuguese and Spanish towards America, Africa and Asia, the Dutch, the Danish, the English and the French have sailed all the oceans in ships built on our lands and in our shipyards."
"At the moment we live in a globalised economy, which means that rationalisation is needed and that is why a series of restructurings has been undertaken."
"However, I believe we are reaching a limit."
"Specifically, the disappearance of all types of aid on 31 December 2000 is going to cause a problem."
"Although I agree with some of the previous speakers, such as Mrs Kauppi, that it is not good to maintain a subsidy system, in the long run this situation clearly harms the sector itself."
"Furthermore, we have been abolishing subsidies in the shipbuilding sector, yet it has continued to fall apart."
"At the moment the shipbuilding sector is in tatters."
"Wherever you go there is a closed shipyard and thousands of people who have lost their jobs."
"For example, since 1984, Astilleros Españoles (Spanish Shipyards) has undergone three restructurings."
"Last Wednesday there were worker demonstrations in Spain, in all the shipbuilding cities - Bilbao, Cádiz, Puerto Real, Seville and Asturias - accompanied by a considerable degree of violence, because we are threatening the lives and security of many millions of homes."
"There is another problem."
"In this globalised economy, it is good that subsidies should disappear, but not when there are some countries which still have them."
"This also raises another question - as some speakers such as Mrs McKenna have said: Is it a good thing that some countries such as Korea maintain this policy?"
"I believe that if we look at the figures properly, it is clear that if ships are sold at less than they cost to make, the country is losing out."
"Therefore, that policy harms that country and its workers."
"Let us remember that a few years ago the Korean workers took to the streets to ask for equal status."
"The general theme of globalisation - as the Commissioner knows - is being discussed at the moment or will be discussed in the World Trade Organisation."
"I think that this is one of the questions which should concern us."
"The European shipbuilding industry is threatened from all sides."
"Some of the speakers - Mrs McKenna herself I believe - have referred to the crisis in the fishing industry."
"It appears that the ideal is the destruction of the Community fishing fleet."
"For transport - including oil-tanker traffic - there are flags of convenience."
"But even the few ships which sail under the European flag have to be manufactured outside Europe, because it appears we are not capable of withstanding distorted competition."
"Therefore, on behalf of the Spaniards who at the moment are enormously worried about this issue, I hope that the Commission will communicate our concern to the Council, our disagreement with the latest resolutions of the Council of Ministers for Industry - which seems prepared to adopt a meekly laissez faire approach and abandon the little which remains of the European shipbuilding sector - and our hope that either measures will be taken to prevent the unfair competition which is occurring or, if not, that steps will be taken to restore Community aid to compensate for the cases of inequality, incompetence and bad practice which are occurring today in all shipbuilding centres."
"Mr President, to follow on from Mr Medina Ortega, I would like to remind you that the Commission and the Council almost always propose employment plans to the governments. They propose that we fight unemployment and say that we must put an end to unemployment in Europe."
"Commissioner, employment plans are not much use if, on the one hand, jobs are constantly being lost in many of our sectors and, specifically, in the sector which we are talking about today, the shipbuilding sector, which involves 300,000 jobs in Europe and around 45,000 in Spain."
"This seems to us to be an impossible equation."
"If you remove the subsidies to our sector, if the Korean sector continues to be subsidised, if working conditions in Europe are to be as they should be, that is very advanced, and in Korea they are terrible, the equation is impossible."
"It is going to be impossible to maintain this sector."
"And I do not want this to happen in the future."
"In Spain there are seven regions with a shipbuilding sector."
"Commissioner, I come from a small region of a million inhabitants."
"In recent years, as a result of European policies and the policies of successive governments, we have lost 6,000 direct jobs in the steel industry, 6,000 direct jobs in mining, 10,000 small agricultural businesses, we have lost jobs in the arms industry and we have lost jobs in the shipbuilding industry."
"When measures are introduced in the European Union - and I know that what I am going to say is out of fashion with many of my colleagues - much account is taken of the laws of the market and of competitiveness."
"The human factor is never, or almost never, taken into account."
"And the human factor is fundamental in the European Union."
"I am afraid to say, Commissioner, that if we continue to lose jobs in the fundamental sectors of our industry, our institutions will no longer have any credibility."
"If the aid stops in December, if aid is maintained in Korea, if in Spain furthermore it is proposed that 18,000 million pesetas of aid, which was granted to the shipbuilding sector, be returned, we are destroying the sector."
"Let us not fool ourselves, let us not use rhetoric."
"I am very sorry to say this, Commissioner, but if we do not adopt urgent and energetic measures, this sector, as well as other industrial sectors in the European Union, is going to go to ruin, to put it politely."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think we must first congratulate and thank the Commission for the fact that we are today holding this debate on the serious situation of the European shipbuilding industry."
"After the Council of Ministers for Industry, on 9 November, and the Commission' s report to Parliament on the situation of the world market in the shipbuilding industry, today we have heard this Commission statement to Parliament, which indicates that there is generalised concern within all the European institutions."
"But I agree with Mr Medina Ortega that this should not be a ""remake"" , because the concern and the measures announced, while significant, do not seem to us to be sufficient at this particular moment."
"Although this Parliament totally supports these measures, we ask above all for more urgency, more efficiency and more thoroughness."
"Free trade, but also fair trade, because everybody knows about the unfair practices in Korea, which make it impossible for our shipyards to be competitive, as has already been pointed out."
"The European Union, Commissioner, with all the political, economic, financial and commercial means at its disposal, must ensure that international rules are obeyed and put an end once and for all to Korean dumping, because the European sector can be viable in an environment of fair competition."
"Commissioner, we must also take advantage of the current unity in the European sector - I am referring to employers and unions - which has been shown in recent times and in recent days, to relaunch the European shipbuilding sector."
"We have to look for and find a European solution."
"Please allow me, Commissioner, to say that I believe that the future of the shipyards in Europe is a political question which requires brave, clear and unequivocal decisions on the part of the Commission of course, but also on all our parts, especially after the conclusions of the latest Council of Ministers for Industry."
"The aid which we have talked about today is also an instrument which the Commission must clarify, especially if it is a future strategy erga omnes."
"Parliament and European industry must know this as soon as possible, since we believe - and after this debate I believe it too - that while the world markets are not stabilised, transitional protective measures are still necessary."
"And we ask for these measures - and I insist - urgently, since many of our shipyards run the serious risk of disappearing, despite being technically and economically viable."
"Finally, since I am also from a peripheral region, I would like to mention the enormous impact on regional development which the shipbuilding industry has, since that industry is based in many of these regions, many of them also included in Objective 1 of the European Regional Policy, with very significant shipyards which generate much direct and indirect employment, a social equilibrium which the countries undergoing cohesion need so much, which demands European solidarity."
"On their behalf I ask, in the case of the shipbuilding industry, for special consideration within the European Union' s regional and competition policy."
"I will conclude, Commissioner."
"I believe that Parliament' s message today is one of support for energetic action by the Commission in this field."
"Thank you for your statement and for the efforts which the Commission has been making, but do not be afraid to apply measures energetically and urgently, as we have asked you today in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the problem we are discussing is a product of globalisation."
"The South Koreans have, in six years, trebled their shipbuilding capacity."
"They have not done it with their own money, but with loans."
"American loans were pressed on them, and the American banks did this in order that they might receive back the largest possible profits."
"Later the South Koreans left these loans, which had been pressed upon them, unpaid."
"The debts, however, were guaranteed, so that the International Monetary Fund sent South Korea money to pay off the American banks."
"In other words, the IMF has itself contributed to the current situation."
"The South Koreans were also advised to devalue their currency, as it was a way for them to free themselves from this economic crisis that we have caused them."
"They have devalued their currency by many tens of per cent and, as a consequence, their prices have become more competitive."
"They did not have to cut wages to reduce their price competitiveness; they only did what we advised them to do, which was to devalue their currency."
"South Korea is thus operating in a world that we have made for them."
"All those politicians who are now complaining about the problems South Korea has caused us are wrong if they claim that globalisation is irreversible and that we can do nothing about it."
"Globalisation is something which politicians can do nothing about if they do not want to."
"If pay in South Korea has gone down from six euros an hour to four euros an hour, it is not the South Koreans who are to blame."
"We are to blame, because we caused the economic crisis in South Korea."
"Now that crisis is simply spreading from South Korea to our shipyards."
"I hope that politicians will show more credibility in this matter and look into the basic causes of the problem, and not just those effects which have been spoken of a good deal here."
"We have wanted to ease the effects of the problem, but that will not happen if we do not do anything about its causes."
"Mr President, in a debate which is as specific and as objective as this one on European shipbuilding, it is not easy to avoid repetition."
"As a matter of fact it is impossible to avoid it, but we are talking about an extremely sensitive political issue and that is why it is important that the Commission and the Council know that there is a broad consensus in Parliament on this matter and great concern to find a solution to the problem."
"As Mrs Langenhagen said, the crisis in Europe' s shipbuilding industry has not appeared overnight, but has been with us for more than 25 years."
"In fact, as the official statistics available to us show, in the last 20 years this industry has lost four-fifths of the jobs that it had in Europe, which is in fact a huge proportion."
"And it is becoming particularly tragic because this massive loss of jobs - in an industry that once employed half a million people - is generally taking place on the periphery of Europe, as you can tell from the nationalities of almost all of the Members who have been speaking here."
"And it is on the periphery of Europe that, as we all know, there are the fewest opportunities for employment."
"But now, in the current state of play, the situation is becoming particularly unsustainable."
"Korea is not the whole problem."
"As several Members have pointed out, the Korean problem has occurred as a result of a combination of situations and factors, some within our control and others outside it: there was the Asian crisis, hyper-devaluation by more than 30% of the national currency - the won - and there was the concomitant support from the IMF which led to this unique - I would call it bizarre - situation in which Korea finds itself, not to mention the unfair way it has competed with us in recent times."
"But we must not forget that this is also the case with the United States."
"The United States, whose propaganda image is as the champion of free trade, of the free market, only takes this position because of what it can gain from it: on the audio-visual industry, on the food industry, on anything that is of interest to them."
"But when it comes to other industries, such as this one, they are highly protectionist."
"We would do well to keep this in mind!"
"This Council position must be followed up."
"It is indeed important for the Council to take a political stand, but it must be followed up."
"I think that it is crucial that the European Union exerts considerable pressure in order to have Korea make a voluntary production agreement in addition to everything that has already been discussed in terms of rules designed to prevent this kind of distortion to competition."
"For one thing is essential: it is not just the jobs that Europe could still lose in this industry that are under threat."
"The problem is that the shipbuilding industry, covering all the kinds of ships that we have discussed today, is an industry of strategic importance for Europe."
"And so, of course, it is undergoing a structural change: the type of ship is going to change certainly, but in an industry of such strategic importance, Europe cannot remain in foreign hands in terms of the building and the supply of these ships."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the opening of a new trade round in which everyone will be talking about free and fair trade, what is happening in the shipbuilding industry is really quite ironic."
"And that is why I think that we in the European Union must be prepared to remember this industry in Seattle, because there is no reason why this industry should remain outside the GATT rules."
"If this does not happen, if this is globalisation, then there is nothing more to say."
"Mr President, I want to thank you for the very wide-ranging and serious discussion here today."
"As has been mentioned, the whole issue of shipbuilding has a deep impact on public opinion."
"We are getting closer to the opening of the world trade negotiations in Seattle and we urgently need the support of the public to be able to go forward with globalisation."
"But if our public thinks that there are rules for some but not for the others, this has a devastating effect for these negotiations."
"There have been discussions on this matter in the Commission which for that reason alone we take very seriously."
"We need free trade but we need fair trade, as has been said here."
"I will reply to those points which are directly my responsibility."
"There have been others and I will forward those questions to my colleagues."
"Mr Caudron asked what has happened so far."
"After the Industry Council I invited the Korean Ambassador to the Commission on Wednesday, presented the conclusions of the Council and explained to him our concern about shipbuilding."
"We consider it extremely important to have a strong shipbuilding industry in Europe."
"We will not accept aggressive measures which would lead to its destruction."
"We also informed the Korean side that it is important that their government supports meetings of the industries."
"In the shipbuilding context and OECD, the intention is to organise a meeting now between both industries to analyse the situation and to draw the necessary conclusions."
"Industry needs to meet but we need public support from both sides for the conclusions reached at this meeting in December."
"Here I am working closely with my colleague, Pascal Lamy."
"Secondly, on the issue of IMF and the World Bank, I was in contact this week with the President of the Industry Council and he has promised to take the issue up in the Presidency so that ECOFIN, which is meeting in November, can discuss the IMF and World Bank role in the area."
"The Finance Ministers in the member countries are, as it were, the counterpart of the IMF and World Bank and it is very important that all the member countries are urged to consider the issue of the possible negative impact of the IMF and World Bank support on the shipbuilding market."
"They need to inquire carefully whether support to shipbuilding and shipbuilders has distorted the situation in the world market."
"After these issues have been discussed, on the one hand by the Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, IMF and the World Bank and, on the other hand, by OECD, we must assess the situation and take any necessary further actions."
"As far as the American shipbuilding issues are concerned, the Jones Act is the famous American legislation."
"It requires orders in United States yards for internal navigation."
"So under this particular legislation the vessel must be built in the USA."
"This Jones Act has been exempted under GATT."
"The only possibility is that the Commission and member countries take the issue up in the WTO context."
"This has been discussed earlier but was resisted very strongly by the Americans."
"The only possibility is that the Commission and member countries take up this issue in a WTO context."
"It was discussed earlier but resisted very strongly by the Americans."
"On the question of shipyards which partly work for the in defence industry, that area has been exempted."
"This issue can be raised if competitors can show that this particular arrangement has caused injury to their shipbuilding market."
"I will analyse the questions which Mr Caudron put and come back to them later."
"I will transmit the other question to my colleagues and I will keep you properly informed about events in the area."
"There are many countries which are seriously concerned."
"As Mrs Langenhagen said, we should not only consider the people who are working directly in the shipyards; there is also a huge skilled population working for shipyards in other industries."
"The negative impact of this distorted market situation is very serious."
"I and my colleagues will follow that very closely."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.20 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 19 November 1999."
"Tribute"
"Ladies and gentlemen, many of you are new to this House but I am sure that all the re-elected Members will have a very clear memory of Carmen Díez de Rivera Icaza."
"You will remember that she had to resign due to illness. She fought against this illness with great courage but I have to tell you that she died yesterday."
"She was a wonderful colleague who opposed conformism and fought for all noble causes, bringing passion to her work and a radiant smile which you all knew."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to think about Carmen now and to observe a minute' s silence in her memory."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Madam President, at the beginning of the last parliamentary term, and as the result of a misunderstanding, there was a public incident between myself and Mrs Díez de Rivera."
"I am not going to comment on her political career for you have just done that admirably, but I must highlight, in public before this House, her human qualities, her personal values, her dignity and the fortitude and courage with which she faced her illness right to the very end."
"I must also emphasise what she did to overcome a difficult situation between us which ended in a warm and loyal friendship which allowed us to sign initiatives together before this House."
"I now feel proud to have been able to put my signature next to hers on those initiatives adopted by this House."
"Madam President, I must firstly thank you for your tribute to Carmen."
"If the cancer had not beaten her, I can assure you that she would have been here today, in her seat among our Group, in this House."
"As I have already told the President, I had the opportunity to visit Carmen in hospital two weeks ago and she asked me to say goodbye to all her colleagues."
"In particular, I want to thank two Members, her nephew Íñigo Méndez de Vigo and Paca Sauquillo, for their efforts to help her throughout the long and difficult process of her final days."
"I must also say that Carmen Díez de Rivera was a woman with a fascinating personality. She was also an excellent MEP and played an absolutely pivotal role in the history of my country and in its transition to democracy."
"I hope that history will one day pay tribute to her for this."
"Madam President, as we all know, the terrorist group ETA has decided on a return to criminal activity, the indefinite cessation of which it announced 14 months ago."
"As a Basque, I want to humbly, simply but firmly express to this House my feelings regarding the shattering of the hope for peace which the Spanish people and the Basques in particular have clung to throughout this period."
"It is tragic to think that there are still people in the European Union today who are helpless in the face of the sectarian violence of a few others and who are having to pay an extremely high price for remaining true to their beliefs in the face of terrorist blackmail."
"I therefore ask this House, which represents all the peoples of the European Union, to show its solidarity with the Basque people in defence of the freedom, respect for the law and peaceful coexistence which we have all craved for so long. We have to believe that, through tolerance towards others and a love for life, we will achieve peace."
"Finally, I ask you to help personally in ensuring the victory of this desire for peace which all the Spanish people share. Together, we can make this road to peace a reality."
"Madam President, on the historic occasion of the convening of the Government of Northern Ireland, there is a certain irony in my taking the floor with good news when our colleague has such problems to report from the Basque area."
"But this is a historic occasion for Northern Ireland."
"It is just twenty years since my colleague, Joe McCartin, first raised Northern Ireland and our conflict here in this Parliament."
"Over the last twenty years thousands have been killed, thousands injured and thousands of families shattered."
"Could I ask you to convey to all political leaders in the North of Ireland and, as we say in Ireland, 'across the pond' , to the British Prime Minister and all his colleagues, and indeed to the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern and to their predecessors, the predecessors on both sides, our sincere thanks for what they have helped to achieve."
"Above all, our thanks go to the political leaders in the North of Ireland, all those who are now part of our new executive in the North of Ireland, particularly to the Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon, and perhaps I may single out the First Minister, David Trimble, for particular mention."
"He has shown courage and leadership, which is what politics is all about."
"May they have many years and decades of successful democratic politics in the North and could you, and indeed through our colleague here, Jim Nicholson, whom I include in the leadership of the North of Ireland, convey the very best wishes of this Parliament to them all."
"Thank you, Mrs Doyle. I have in fact anticipated your wish."
"On behalf of this House, I have already written to all the leaders of the major parties in Northern Ireland to express our admiration for what they have achieved and to send them our best and warmest wishes for the favourable continuation of the peace process."
"Madam President, coming from Donegal, a border county in the historic province of Ulster, I, like my Irish colleague Mrs Doyle, have a very special appreciation for the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland in the recent past, and in particular the developments of the last few days."
"A government has been formed and the transfer of powers and devolution is only hours away."
"The courage and perseverance of the political leaders in the North of Ireland, together with the contribution of the Irish Taoiseach, his predecessors, the British Prime Minister and his predecessors, is only to be commended."
"And there is one person who has played an integral part in all this, Senator George Mitchell, whose contribution to the peace process is immeasurable."
"I also want to wish David Trimble, First Minister, and his Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon, their government, the Assembly members and the people of Northern Ireland, peace and prosperity into the next millennium."
"I believe that the entire island of Ireland can only benefit from the developments of the last few days."
"This Parliament, and I thank you for having sent your good wishes to the respective leaders, has played a very important role in the peace progress."
"We have at all times supported the peace process in a positive and practical way through financial support."
"Our decisions were taken here unanimously: support for the International Fund for Ireland, support for the peace and reconciliation programme and, of course, Interreg."
"While I welcome this Parliament' s contribution, I also want to acknowledge the contribution of the European Commission over the years, and in particular former Presidents, President Delors, our colleague and former President, Jacques Santer, and now President Prodi who, in his statement yesterday, committed himself to the continuation of funds towards the various programmes in Northern Ireland."
"Let us all work together for the benefit of those people and hopefully other parts of this continent would look towards Northern Ireland and strive to resolve their problems in a similar way."
"Madam President, much has been said, but as a child who grew up in Belfast and spent thirty of my thirty-nine years in the violent conflict in my homeland, I personally want to mark today' s historic occasion."
"It is a historic day."
"I am deliberately sitting in John Hume' s seat today because, as a Nobel Prize Winner from this Parliament who has devoted his whole life to securing the peace process, I think it is important that we honour him since he is recuperating at home in Northern Ireland."
"It is important to say today that the will of the people has been done in Northern Ireland."
"71% of the people voted for peace, the politicians on all sides have been big enough to deliver that will of the people for future generations."
"I have to say in my case perhaps it was too late."
"I left Northern Ireland because there was no future, no jobs, no opportunities for young people, but I am delighted that today the future generations will have those opportunities, and Europe has played a critical role in that process."
"Madam President, I want to add my voice to celebrate this historic agreement."
"You have already sent a letter conveying our best wishes to the Northern Ireland authorities."
"Could you send another letter to invite our Northern Ireland friends, the executive, to pay a visit to the Parliament."
"I feel that it is our duty to mention the role that one of our colleagues, Mr John Hume, has played in this process."
"He is in better shape after four operations and a long convalescence and I hope that he will be back among us very soon."
"Madam President, can I say I am very pleased to accept the glowing tributes paid to my colleagues for the success achieved at the weekend."
"I would stress the credit that should be given to my party leader, David Trimble, for his courage and fortitude."
"There are very few times you see a political person putting everything on the line."
"He put his entire future on the line."
"I just hope he succeeds."
"There is still a long way to go."
"Do not be over-enthusiastic, but I have no doubt that he would be delighted."
"I will pass on to him the best wishes of this Parliament for the future."
"There was a delegation from the European People' s Party in Belfast on Monday who were able to witness the historic happenings on that particular day."
"David Trimble expressed his wish and desire to come to Europe again, hopefully in the middle of January, and I would look forward to that happening, as I am sure, Madam President, you will too."
"Madam President, may I ask you to take action on an issue which is just as important as those mentioned and which concerns my country, Greece."
"As I was preparing my proposal on the Morillon reports yesterday, I was amazed to find in a Parliament document by the Secretariat of the Working Party on Enlargement, from the international and institutional affairs section of DG IV headed by Martine Chariot, the following totally unacceptable reference under point 6 concerning relations between Turkey and the European Union:"
"It is entitled ""The Situation in the Aegean"" and the draftsperson of one of our documents, of a European Parliament document, presents the Aegean islands, which are part of Greek territory under international treaties, as a region of disputed sovereignty between Greece and Turkey."
"To put it bluntly, Mrs Fontaine, it is akin to describing Alsace and Lorraine to you, a European and French citizen, as regions of disputed sovereignty between France and Germany."
"I request, not only for the record and for the sake of historical accuracy, but for material reasons, because you will understand the political significance of such texts, that this unacceptable and extremely dangerous wording be taken out of the document."
"Mr Efthymiou, I can promise you that we will look into this very carefully and, if necessary, a correction will be made."
"Madam President, we too welcome the peace in Northern Ireland and the new Executive which has been established. We also join Mr Valdivielso in expressing our concern about ETA' s threat to return to violence."
"However, I actually asked for the floor in order to join Mr Barón Crespo in expressing my feelings about the loss of Carmen Díez de Rivera."
"Instead of referring to her role in the transition to democracy, as my colleague has already admirably done, I want to mention the personal relationship which we enjoyed for six years in the Committee on the Environment."
"We too feel her loss greatly."
"She worked extensively to defend the Spanish and European environment and her death at such an early age is terrible."
"I therefore join Mr Barón Crespo in expressing my feelings of loss."
"Madam President, naturally I welcome the start of a hopefully permanent process towards peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole."
"We must applaud the work of all the political leaders who have participated in this process."
"I must highlight here and now the historic role played by John Hume who had the foresight, some years ago, to ensure that Sinn Fein and Gerry Adams joined him in the search for a political solution to Ireland' s historic problem."
"I must also stress the concern which we all feel about the abandonment of the truce by ETA."
"In this respect, I must say that I consider the use of violence to achieve political agreements to be absolutely unacceptable nowadays, whether in Europe or in any other part of the world."
"However, a political agreement is now absolutely essential in the Basque Country, as it was in Ireland, and the narrow-mindedness and reactionary attitude of the Spanish Government in refusing to accept a political agreement with the Basque national parties within the peace process is totally unacceptable."
"Having said this, the European Parliament, as the highest institution in Europe, should also adopt a position on this issue in order to facilitate a process of political agreement in the Basque Country."
"Madam President, I am a Basque and I belong to the Basque Nationalist party."
"However, firstly, I congratulate the leaders, political parties, intermediaries and, in particular, the people of Britain and Ireland, on having found a road to peace by all giving ground on their original positions."
"I, too, join in the condemnation expressed by this European Parliament with regard to ETA' s abandonment of the truce. I can confirm my total rejection of the use of violence to achieve political aims."
"However, I must also say very firmly that we have a problem in the Basque Country for we are in political conflict with the Spanish State."
"From this Parliament I call on the Spanish Government and the Spanish political parties to have the same tolerance as the British and Irish so that we can all find the road to peace and a solution to the Basque conflict which is as much a European matter as the Irish conflict."
"We Basques want peace and we want to find a lasting solution which is acceptable to everyone."
"However, to achieve this, we must all make an effort to find common ground for the future and for peace."
"Thank you."
"We really cannot start a debate and you must appreciate that all these points of order are turning into one."
"Madam President, I too am a Basque and I am also a woman and a Socialist. I am one of the 92% of Basque people who voted in the Basque Country in favour of the Statute of Autonomy and in favour of democracy."
"Madam President, there is a democracy in the Basque Country."
"There are elections which are free and democratic."
"There is a Statute of Autonomy for which the vast majority of Basques voted."
"The Basque people and the Basque institutions have risen to the occasion."
"Yet, in the Basque Country, there is a terrorist organisation which wants to control our lives, which has returned to blackmail and to which the Basques and all those in favour of democracy have said 'no' ."
"This is basically all I wanted to say."
"Madam President, I would just like to say that it is inadmissible in a democracy to let people of one political persuasion speak about the Basque country and not to allow anyone of a different political persuasion to speak."
"That is inadmissible in any Parliament."
"It is not a parliament, if that happens."
"So I protest very strongly."
"I would like to have three minutes, which is a fraction of the length of time this subject has been discussed, just to explain my point of view."
"I know many people here are very fond of democracy and the ways of parliamentarism."
"Could I speak, Madam President?"
"No. I really do not think that would be right."
"This is not a debate on the issue and you have already spoken for one minute."
"We just cannot continue in this way."
"This is not a scheduled item on the agenda."
"Madam President."
"You are quite right in what you have just said."
"It is, of course, most encouraging to hear different views on this important issue but then, as you see, other Members ask for the floor and we really should turn our attention to the agenda and get down to work."
"The Commission is here, Mrs Reding is waiting to report and we really should get down to work."
"I particularly agree with you, Mr Poettering, because, in addition to that, I have some information to impart and some delegations to welcome which will all take time."
"Madam President, I disagree with the Member except for one point on which he is right."
"When three or four people have been allowed to express an opinion, basic democracy would say that another opinion should be allowed, even if they disagree with this."
"The representative of a large group cannot be permitted to speak for three minutes while the representative of a small group is refused, even if you disagree with them and even if what this person is going to say is deplorable."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, this is the problem, as well you know, with points of order."
"When a Member asks for the floor on a point of order, which they are not always - and you may also have been guilty of this - the President cannot guess what this Member is going to say."
"I cannot allow a debate to start. If I did, then every single group would have to be given the chance to speak."
"Madam President, I wish to raise a point of order under Rule 179 dealing with relations with the Ombudsman."
"On 29 July this year the Ombudsman wrote to this Parliament on an own-initiative inquiry on his part calling for a code of good administrative behaviour and asking for a response by 30 November."
"Up to yesterday, he had not had a reply."
"I understand that you have today written to the Ombudsman but I wish to know when the Members of this Parliament are going to have the opportunity to respond to the Ombudsman' s request for comments in his own-initiative inquiry."
"Quite right, Mr Perry."
"I have in fact signed this letter today."
"A draft has been prepared on this matter and is currently being finalised."
"I believe that it will be submitted for approval by the Bureau of the European Parliament in December."
"I can therefore fully reassure you in this respect."
"Welcome"
"It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the House, to welcome all the Presidents of the Parliaments of the twelve applicant states who are seated in the public gallery."
"They are here to participate in the eighth meeting between the Presidents of the national parliaments of the applicant states and this House."
"These meetings were started by my predecessors, Klaus Hänsch and José Maria Gil-Robles."
"We worked very hard yesterday and they will be leaving us in a few moments to continue this work which has proved extremely fruitful in terms of our common goal to unite our extensive European family."
"I therefore welcome them very warmly."
"We also have a delegation from the Estonian Parliament led by its President, Mr Tunne Kelam."
"I must emphasise the role which the joint parliamentary committee is playing in the current negotiations which should also lead to Estonia' s accession to the European Union."
"I welcome you very warmly."
"(Applause)"
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities gave a ruling on 25 November which, in the action brought by Mr Martinez and Mr De Gaulle against the European Parliament, closes for the time being the interim proceedings started by these Members."
"In this ruling, the President of the court ordered that the Act of the European Parliament of 14 September 1999 adopting the interpretation proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of Rule 29 of Parliament' s Rules of Procedure should be set aside."
"The effect of this order is that the mixed Technical Group of Independent Members is permitted to exist and is acknowledged as a political group in every respect."
"With regard to parliamentary activity, the TDI Group shall immediately enjoy all rights accorded by the Rules of Procedure to duly constituted political groups. With regard to finance and administration, this group has the right to sufficient staffing to enable it to function and to the appropriations allocated to political groups according to the current scale."
"At its meeting this morning, the Bureau of the European Parliament took the necessary steps to ensure that the provisions of the aforementioned order are correctly applied."
"It is quite clear that these provisions are of a provisional nature pending the final judgement of the Court of First Instance on this case."
"The Bureau has also decided to ask the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market whether an appeal should be lodged with the Court of Justice against the order."
"Madam President, this is a point of order on the agenda."
"Thank you for having announced the order of the Court of First Instance and therefore the reinstatement of the TDI Group."
"It is really quite embarrassing that a democratic institution should have to be given a lesson by a court on civic, parliamentary and electoral law."
"Thank you for this announcement, Madam President."
"I asked for the floor because, as you know, following the dissolution of the TDI Group out of hand, we Radicals announced that we would no longer participate in voting in this House."
"As a result of your information, the Radicals will now resume voting."
"However, despite this resumption, our fight to amend the Rules of Procedure will continue. In this respect, we have tabled a motion for resolution, supported by 80 Members, aimed at allowing a proper mixed group of non-attached Members to be constituted."
"I must thank the Members who have supported this move which will ensure the dignity of all Members without discrimination."
"I must also sincerely thank Mr Barón Crespo for offering to join our group, together with Mr Cohn-Bendit, although this was not the problem at issue."
"While thanking him, I must say that we will continue to fight to ensure that there is no discrimination between Members. I hope that the mixed group of non-attached Members will soon exist on a par with all the other groups and that the discrimination of non-attached Members, who are the real pariahs of this House, which has been the case for twenty years, will never occur again."
"I have one final piece of information."
"Mrs Britt Theorin, chairman of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, has taken an initiative with which I personally fully agree. She has sent all male MEPs a letter encouraging them to wear a white ribbon as a sign of their public commitment not to perpetrate violence or to excuse or remain silent about violence against women."
"I believe that we can very heartily encourage this initiative."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the agenda. The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Regarding Wednesday: Firstly, Mr Karlsson, who is to present the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors, must leave at 7 p.m."
"I therefore propose that this item is brought forward on the agenda so that this presentation takes place immediately after the statement on human rights."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"The Di Pietro report, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, must be taken off the agenda as it has not yet been adopted in committee. This is because the committee does not have all the language versions."
"Regarding Thursday:The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has asked for the inclusion on tomorrow morning' s agenda of the recommendation for second reading on the Customs 2000 programme."
"The rapporteur is Mr Moraes."
"This recommendation was adopted and tabled yesterday and is currently on the agenda for Wednesday 14 December in Strasbourg. We will therefore include it on the agenda for tomorrow."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party propose that this recommendation is taken without debate and is included under voting time tomorrow."
"Madam President, on behalf of the PSE Group I support this request which concerns a programme which must enter into force on 5 January."
"There is agreement between the main political groups on this issue and the Council also seems to agree with the amendments made by the Committee on Legal Affairs of this House. These could therefore easily be approved tomorrow."
"So, I propose that this recommendation is included on the agenda for tomorrow."
"(Parliament approved the proposal) President."
"This item is therefore included under voting time tomorrow."
"Finally, in view of the late tabling of the Fraga Estevez report on the COM in fisheries and aquaculture, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, the deadline for tabling amendments is extended until 4 p.m. today."
"The Community and sport"
"The next item is the Commission communication on preserving current sports structures and the social function of sports in a Community framework, the Community support scheme for the campaign against drugs in sport and Commission participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important time for sport in Europe because it is now firmly on the agenda."
"This has come about quite simply because sport is a popular phenomenon."
"Europe is responsible for its people and must therefore look after and preserve what is good in sport and try to solve the problems which arise."
"You may remember that, in Mr Prodi' s inaugural speech to this House, he spoke of the new Commission' s desire to be on close terms with the people and, in this context, he emphasised the importance of fighting the scourge of drugs."
"This is now being achieved. The first stone has been laid today of a structure which will be built to ensure that fair play once again becomes an integral part of sport."
"The anti-doping campaign will be in two stages."
"Firstly, the Commission has helped to set up the World Anti-Doping Agency."
"This was not easy, to say the least."
"In fact, it was very complicated, but we fought hard and finally achieved this goal."
"I have been appointed by the Commission to negotiate with the Council and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Mr Samaranch, to ensure that this new anti-doping agency is established on a sound basis."
"What is this basis? Firstly, it must be transparent and independent."
"Secondly, it must equally represent the worlds of sport and government."
"Thirdly, all its members worldwide must make solemn the commitment to implement the decisions taken by the agency in their own area."
"Finally, this agency clearly must be responsible for drawing up the list of banned products, monitoring the laboratories, setting up control systems, establishing out-of-competition tests and enforcing the law."
"This last item involves combating the gangs which sell banned products. The agency must also be responsible for prevention so that young people dissociate themselves psychologically and actively from the scourge of drugs."
"Madam President, I can inform you that the decision makers of the IOC have listened to both the Council and the Commission."
"Europe' s demands have been entered word for word in the statutes of the new agency and, on 10 November, these statutes were signed."
"In future we will have two representatives on the board of this agency, as will the Council of Europe."
"Furthermore, the latter asked us to negotiate on its behalf, so we negotiated not just for the European Union but also for the Council of Europe."
"It is due to the actions of Europe that this agency has come into being."
"Whether or not it succeeds in its mission no longer depends on us, as we will be but two of thirty to forty partners."
"We must take the fight forward together and jointly establish the foundations for an anti-doping campaign."
"We have done our best in this first step and the next steps must be taken together with our worldwide partners."
"We do not have total freedom of movement to make this world agency succeed although we will do everything in our power to ensure this happens, but the other partners must be in agreement. We have therefore decided at the same time to draw up a European plan of action against doping in which we will be totally free to meet our obligations."
"This plan of action was decided upon this morning by the Commission, bringing together several Commissioners, each responsible for their own area."
"The Research Commissioner will use the basic or applied research programmes of the Fifth Framework Research programme, as well as other options, in the anti-doping campaign in order to reinforce the means available to this campaign."
"The Education and Youth Commissioner will allow the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth programmes to be used for providing training and establishing cooperation between young people so that the anti-doping campaign becomes something that is sought after by European youth."
"The Health Commissioner will ensure that the existing directives, for example, on labelling of medicines for human use, are also developed in terms of anti-doping."
"He has also promised to submit a recommendation covering all the issues of public health, health of young sportspeople and health of sportspeople in general for wide-ranging and concerted action by the Member States in the campaign against doping."
"On the enforcement side, the Commissioner responsible for third pillar issues, namely internal policies, will use existing plans and programmes to make the forces of law and order aware of this anti-doping campaign."
"Madam President, you know that from next year, at both world and European level, we are going to make the anti-doping campaign a spearhead of our sports policy."
"We also have a second plan."
"During the Vienna Summit, the governments asked us to submit for the Helsinki Summit a document on sport as an element of society, or social sport."
"This House, on 17 December last year I believe, adopted a resolution on this same subject."
"We are about to fulfil our mandate because the Commission has decided to submit a plan concerning a communication on preserving current sports structures and the social function of sports in the Community framework."
"It is clear that the Commission and the EU have no legal basis for starting to lay down regulations."
"We will not do this, because we do not have the power to do this. However, in all the political areas where we do have a legal basis we will use the existing means to work for sport."
"I can give you a very specific example."
"In the Structural Funds, a significant part of the money can be allocated to projects in favour of sport."
"We also need a new approach with regard to the people of Europe."
"The Commission does not want to appear to be shut off in its ivory tower devising regulations to impose on the good people."
"Absolutely not."
"We believe that our role is to find a consensus between those who, in the Member States, have political responsibility and those who, in the world of sport, have responsibility for organising sport."
"We are all going to get round a table to discuss, listen and find out what is not working and propose solutions which respect the independence of sports federations and the subsidiarity implemented in our fifteen Member States."
"Before then we will start to look at the benefits and obstacles to sport in European legislation."
"For example, some practices have nothing to do with the rules on competition."
"Therefore, the fact that a football team has eleven players has nothing to do with competition."
"This aspect is completely outside the area of competition."
"There are also practices which are, in principle, prohibited under the rules on competition."
"For example, if, during a major championship, tickets are sold only to nationals and sales to non-nationals or other European citizens are refused, this contravenes the rules on competition and positive action must be taken against this."
"However, where there is an apparent conflict with the rules on competition but the sports federations undertake in their actions to use the funds raised to bring education and social action to sport, some practices are then likely to be exempted from the rules on competition."
"I can give you a specific example of this."
"Some federations have up to now collectively sold audiovisual rights."
"If this monopoly action only benefits the business world, it is clear that this comes under business. However, if the money raised is distributed to the clubs which provide education and training to youngsters, this action is in the collective interest and an exemption from the rules on competition is allowed."
"I have briefly explained how we will act in the future with regard to the new sports policy to be introduced. From next year, a wide-ranging dialogue will be held with all the federations, large or small, and the politicians in our Member States so that together we can decide how to 'regulate' ."
"The aim will not be to draw up new rules but to establish barriers and safeguards so that everything is clear. We must work together in the interests of our young people, fair play and the commitment of sport to society in its fight against racism and xenophobia."
"I have a question for the Commissioner."
"In order to combat doping, there is one thing which we must do as a European Union. This is to fight against the over-commercialisation of sport which has led to a threefold increase in competitions."
"This is the reason for all the doping."
"While the Tour de France and the Giro d' Italia are as long as they are, and there are three matches per week for professional football teams, drugs will be used."
"While sport and the number of competitions are left unregulated, drugs will be used."
"If we do not do our duty by preparing a European directive on the protection of sportspeople, including professionals, we will not be tackling the root causes of doping."
"The Member is absolutely right."
"I have discussed this with many professional sportspeople and the main reason they give for being virtually forced to take drugs is exactly the reason given by Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"However, he should know that, without a legal basis to prepare a directive on sport, we cannot act in the way he wishes."
"The only thing we can do, in this round table with the federations, is ask them to bring good sense into play and to re-establish the prestige of sport."
"Given the equal representation of the worlds of sport and government in the World Anti-Doping Agency and given all those who will sit on the board of this agency - all the federations and all the National Olympic Committees - who have all undertaken to implement, in their own area, the decisions taken by the agency, there is real hope."
"If the agency were to adopt a directive, for example, so that sporting events could be returned to a scale which was humanly possible for sportspeople, this would be a major step forward, but I cannot go further than I am authorised."
"It will be up to the agency to act in this respect."
"However, I can tell the honourable Member that the European authorities will work in this direction."
"Madam President, first of all I want to welcome the communication from Commissioner Reding."
"It must not be forgotten that sport in Europe was born of the oldest known truce, namely the sacred truce which gave rise to the Olympics."
"This means that it also has a political value of peace."
"Hundreds of thousands of young people, both male and female, start and develop their education through sport."
"I have a question concerning the last comment made by the Commissioner."
"In addition to being a social and training activity, sport is currently part of the world of big business and is actually one of the most important business activities."
"My question is as follows: Does the Commission intend the policy which must be developed on sport, particularly in view of the concentration of power which is occurring in the audiovisual media, to lead to a joint action between her Directorate-General and the one responsible for defending competition?"
"I believe that this is one of the key questions for Europe and the world."
". (FR) Madam President, this is a very complex question and the answer can only be given once dialogue has been held between the worlds of politics and sport."
"We are keen to see order restored and balance re-established in sport and to ensure that sport as fair play and true competition regains its prestige."
"This will not be easy as this is an enormous task, but I believe that, with the help of politicians and through public assistance and pressure, we can achieve these goals."
"It is also very clear that we can act on sport only in its social and educational aspects."
"When sport becomes a purely business matter, there can be no exceptions."
"Sport will, at this point, be dealt with like any other business activity."
"That is plain and clear."
"It is only when sport fulfils an important social function that we can give it a helping hand in order to restore order."
"Sport as a business will be regarded and dealt with like any other business."
"Madam President, Mrs Reding, allow me to congratulate you on your initiative on the issue of doping."
"We can only hope that you will make some proper headway with the people who always make out that they would fight doping."
"I think we are on the right track and I wish you luck."
"However, I would like to come back to what my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit said."
"We cannot legislate because, as you said, there is no legal basis in the Treaty."
"As you know, in my 1996 report, I called, on behalf of Parliament, for sport to be included in the Treaty at long last."
"We wanted it to have its own line in Article 128 - under culture."
"But we failed."
"There is something like a declaration attached to the Treaty, but it is not enough to prevent our having to ask ourselves every year when we debate the budget, should we or should we not fund sport?"
"I think that if what you have said, if what you submit to the Council in Helsinki is to make sense, then we must conclude that the European Parliament is not confined to making statements on Bosman judgements or competition issues in sport, but can give sport a true value by paying more than mere lip service to it in the Treaty."
"Only then will we be able to do what my colleague Mr Cohn-Bendit said, only then will we be able to use the budget to give constructive support to cross-border sporting events."
"I urge you from the bottom of my heart to persuade your colleagues at the Commission to take a real step forward with the Council in Helsinki by including a sub-section on sport in the Treaty."
"Only then will we be able to make any real progress on this issue!"
"Madam President, Mrs Pack has spoken from the heart."
"Unfortunately, she is right."
"My life would be far easier if I were able to construct a sports policy on the basis of an article in the Treaty."
"But, unfortunately, I have no such facility."
"Only the Intergovernmental Conference could give me this facility if they were to sit down and include an article on sport in the Treaty."
"Could, if etc. etc."
"Will it happen? I hope so, I pray so, I dream so."
"But, as things stand, I can only say that most governments are against an article on sport in the Treaty, although there are governments which want to move in this direction."
"I would like to see Parliament extend its lobbying activities on sport by helping and convincing the various governments to vote for a legal basis for sport in the Treaty similar to, and this would be most satisfactory for the purposes of subsidiarity, the legal basis for culture."
"That would make our life much easier, but it is just wishful thinking and pie in the sky."
"Madam President, although I welcome the Commissioner' s statement, there is a contradiction in what she has just said."
"She answered Mr Cohn-Bendit' s question by saying that she has no legal basis to act against this over-professionalisation of sport. Yet, in answer to the question of Mr Barón Crespo, she said that she intends to act when it is a matter of business."
"The EC Treaty gives the Commission very few means of proposing directives, but it is clear that organisations such as the Tour de France, the Giro d' Italia, the Tennis Masters and many others are pure business."
"These are profit-making activities and, seen from this perspective, the Commission could therefore at least try to regulate the sector and its working conditions to a certain extent. As Mr Cohn-Bendit very rightly said, if sportspeople take drugs, it is because the competitions require this."
". (FR) I must clarify my words, Madam President."
"I never said that I will not act when sport becomes commercial, in fact I said the contrary."
"I said that when sport is a purely economic and business activity, this is when the rules on competition will fully apply to prevent any deviations in sport."
"I will indeed act when sport, as a social activity, is threatened by the rules on competition."
"This is when the Commission will be ready to introduce corrective measures."
"We know full well that sport is being blown off course on account of its business aspect."
"This is why we must help sport at the level which is of interest to all the people of Europe, not just as entertainment, but also as an educational activity, promoting solidarity between people, both young and old, and also between the various nations."
"At this point we can do something."
"When sport is a business, it must be regarded like any other business in Europe."
"Commissioner, I must firstly congratulate you on the promotion of sports issues within the Commission."
"As you have just said, sport has a very important place in daily life in Europe and must therefore be afforded this same status in the European Parliament, as Mr Prodi said in his inaugural speech."
"Congratulations are also in order for your work in setting up the World Anti-Doping Agency. However, as a sportswoman, I must also ask that, as well as taking the positive step of imposing strict rules on athletes with regard to doping, we should listen to them and put their interests above economic and business interests."
"Furthermore, it seems that the Council wants to eliminate the budget heading on sport at second reading."
"As a sportswoman, a European citizen and a Member of this House, I must very firmly indicate my disagreement with this Council proposal. Also, what steps is the Commission intending to take to ensure that sport has a budget in the European Union, so that we can work from here for European sport?"
". (FR) I made an appeal to this House for all the sportspeople who are Members to help me develop a proper sports policy which is robust, realistic and productive."
"Of course, if we have some great champions in this House, which we do, I thank them in advance for giving me a hand."
"I fully understand the frustration at not being able to do more. Believe me, I am the first to be frustrated because, if I had a legal basis, I could demand a budget."
"I could, together with this House, press forward and develop programmes for our youngsters and for our sportspeople."
"Unfortunately, I have no legal basis. Without this, I will have no budget heading."
"I am therefore forced to be creative, to innovate and to find sources other than direct sources."
"This is why our anti-doping plan intends to use all the policies which, in one way or another, can help to fight this scourge, such as research, health, education and the third pillar."
"I would like nothing more than to escape from this impasse. So if this House can persuade the governments of the Fifteen, during the Intergovernmental Conference, to introduce an article into the EC Treaty allowing us to establish a proper sports policy, I will be the first to cheer and applaud."
"Thank you, Commissioner, and ladies and gentlemen."
"The debate is closed."
"Preparation of European Council of 10-11 December 1999 in Helsinki"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the European Council of 10 and 11 December 1999 in Helsinki."
"Without any further delay, I give the floor to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Halonen."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union' s Heads of State and Government will shortly be gathering in Helsinki with a very busy agenda in front of them."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on all the hard work and careful planning it has put into preparing this European Council."
"Thanks to these efforts, the Summit will, I am sure, be a great success."
"One of the main items on the agenda at Helsinki will, of course, be enlargement."
"In the composite paper issued last month, the Commission argued strongly for the need to maintain the momentum of reform in the candidate countries."
"These countries have already made considerable efforts in order to meet, with time, the Copenhagen criteria."
"Our task is now to reward their great efforts in such a way as to encourage further progress while dispelling complacency."
"If we fail to give our recognition, some of these countries may become disillusioned and turn their backs on us: their economies would start to diverge, progress towards democracy and respect for human rights may mark time and an historic opportunity will have been lost, perhaps forever."
"This is why we need a swift but surefooted accession process, and I certainly hope the Helsinki Summit will adopt the accession strategy we recommended in October and will decide, provided the necessary conditions are met, to start accession negotiations next year with Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia."
"What I am hoping to see emerge from Helsinki, therefore, is a fully flexible, multi-speed accession process under which negotiations with each of the twelve candidate countries proceed in parallel with its political and economic progress."
"This system, which has been compared to a regatta, allows each country to move at its own pace, be assessed on its own merits and join when it is finally able to meet all the obligations of membership."
"I hope that the European Council will grant Turkey the official status of a candidate country."
"Clearly, accession negotiations cannot be opened with Turkey until it meets the Copenhagen political criteria, with their clear emphasis on human rights, respect for minorities and complete religious freedom."
"I, too, in this respect, would remind you of what the Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs said about the serious Öçalan case."
"However, by granting it candidate status, we would be giving Turkey a definite incentive to continue moving in the right direction."
"Another important item on the agenda at Helsinki will, of course, be the Intergovernmental Conference which must carry out the institutional reforms needed to prepare the EU for enlargement."
"I hope the Summit will agree to launch this conference very soon, because the enlargement process will be beginning in about three years' time and it will continue, uninterrupted, for a good few years after that."
"In practice, this means the necessary reforms must be in place by the end of 2002 if we are to be ready on schedule."
"Therefore, since a long time is needed for ratification, our time is short."
"What are the necessary institutional reforms?"
"The major ones were outlined in the conclusions of the Cologne Summit and discussions on their scope began with the report I commissioned from Mr Dehaene, Mr Von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon."
"Parliament has tabled contributions, as has the Commission in the document we issued on 10 November The Presidency is due to report its findings to the European Council."
"I believe there is a growing agreement among us on the question of which reforms are needed."
"First, there are the issues specifically referred to at Amsterdam, namely the number of Commissioners, the representation of Member States in the Council and the extension of qualified majority voting."
"These three issues are, in any case, interrelated."
"Secondly, there are matters arising from those issues. For example, enlargement will have an impact on all the other European institutions and bodies, such as the Court of Justice and, indeed, this House which, as new Member States join, will have to make room for up to 700 representatives, and not more than 700."
"Furthermore, the codecision procedure will have to be extended to legislation for which qualified majority voting itself has already been extended."
"Finally, there are matters for which preparatory work is to be done outside the IGC but which might, towards the end of the conference, be included in the Treaty or affect it in one way or another."
"I am thinking, for example, of specific issues: firstly, discussions on security and defence."
"The European Council will adopt important decisions in this field and on the management of the non-military aspects of international crises."
"The Commission has been closely involved in the policy-making process, as a result of which new operational structures will be set up. They will enable us to travel further along the route towards integration, already traced in Cologne."
"I welcome these important developments and I undertake to do all I can at Helsinki to help bring them about and to ensure that they are consistent with the EU's institutional framework."
"The Commission intends to commit itself to fully implementing the decisions adopted by the Heads of State and Government, particularly the decisions on procedures for providing assistance during international crises."
"Implementation will involve not only providing financial assistance, which must be guaranteed, but also sending experts to carry out emergency work on the ground."
"This will call for our services to put a lot of effort into its organisation and management. These are certainly issues that cannot be ignored."
"More generally, I would like to point out that a common foreign and security policy requires the creation of a European defence industry that can compete efficiently in both technological and financial terms."
"The Commission intends to promote this by using all the instruments at its disposal relating to the internal market, commercial and competition policies. I am in favour of the changes that are now taking place."
"Then there is the work begun at Tampere on drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the possible restructuring of the Treaty, separating its basic, essential texts from its implementing provisions."
"This would make the essential texts simpler to read and allow the less essential ones to be amended via a less cumbersome procedure."
"I do not underestimate the difficulties, both technical and political. As a first step, the Commission will ask academic experts to carry out a detailed feasibility study on this project."
"In this respect, I intend to ask the European University Institute of Florence - which has specialists in this subject from all European countries - to study this matter."
"Once this has been done we shall have to carefully consider how to proceed with this idea."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues must be tackled if our institutions are to function effectively in an enlarged European Union. Above all, it is essential that we scale down the number of decisions that still have to be taken unanimously."
"Maintaining unanimous voting will result either in complete paralysis or in everything being reduced to the lowest common denominator, a luxury we cannot afford in today' s world, where immediate action is called for in areas of vital importance to the European Union' s future."
"Finally, one more example: trade talks are beginning in Seattle, and the EU must punch its full weight in these negotiations."
"In the wake of the Tampere Summit, the Heads of State and Government are including justice and home affairs as a priority area."
"The European tax package is now in great difficulty."
"Yet it is not only an important initiative to combat harmful tax competition but also an essential aspect of our employment strategy."
"If we continue to burden our jobs with taxes, as we have done until now, our employment policy will certainly be contradictory."
"On all these three fronts, Europe is handicapped by the unanimity requirement."
"It is like a soldier trying to march with a ball and chain around one leg."
"I hope that Helsinki, by launching the reform process, will clearly show we have the ambition and the political will to rid ourselves of this encumbrance and to tackle the other crucial issues before us."
"The European Parliament will, of course, be fully involved in the IGC."
"The European Union exists for its citizens, whom you represent, and the reforms we are planning must serve their interests."
"That is why I look forward to seeing this House play a key role in the reform process and in building the enlarged Europe of tomorrow."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Helsinki Summit on 10 and 11 December is highly significant for Europe in the 21st century in general and for the European Union in particular."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, we wholeheartedly welcome the decision to start negotiations with Latvia and Lithuania and with Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Malta."
"I hope that it will become clear when we embark on discussions with the three Baltic states that the security of these three states is in good hands in the European Union."
"I have held discussions with representatives from these three countries over the past few days."
"They are most concerned at Russia' s behaviour in Chechnya and by opening negotiations with Latvia and Lithuania, rather than just Estonia, as we did at the beginning, we are sending out the right signal and the Baltic states will know that they belong to our Community and will soon enjoy the security which membership of the European Union brings."
"We in the PPE-DE group take Turkey seriously and we make no secret of the fact."
"We always were, and continue to be, Turkey' s friend."
"We were the group in the European Parliament which pressed, before anyone else, for Customs Union."
"But, there is also a strong minority in our group which does not share the majority view."
"The majority of the group takes the view that, if Turkey becomes a member of the European Union, and we must be clear on this, then the European Union will take on a different political, economic and cultural quality."
"I know, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you have been highly committed in the past to monitoring and discussing the Kurdish problem and you know full well to what I refer."
"I would urge the other groups, if we are to subscribe to this compromise text as a European defence policy, to accept a motion for a long-overdue debate on the geographical enlargement of the European Union."
"We are waiting for the Council of Ministers to nail its colours to the mast and tell us exactly what the geographical enlargement of the European Union will look like."
"That will give us plenty to debate over coming weeks and months."
"Then there is the Intergovernmental Conference: Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have every confidence that you will succeed in making it clear in Helsinki that we do not intend to confine ourselves to the three Amsterdam leftovers."
"Obviously, the extension of majority voting is crucial."
"But it is also crucial for the European Parliament to be given codecision powers on all matters decided by majority vote in the Council of Ministers."
"If we, as a European Union, want a place in the global economy and on the increasingly globalised political scene, then we must make up our minds to give the European Union a legal capacity so that representatives of the European Union can act on behalf of the European Union."
"At the moment the European Union is a non-starter."
"It cannot even buy a house."
"These are the facts and this is the root of the problem."
"There are numerous other issues too."
"What worries me is this, and I would ask you to take this very seriously in the Council of Ministers and in the Commission: the European Union can only be enlarged subject to certain conditions."
"I am a passionate advocate of enlargement because, having shaken off Communism, the countries of Central Europe have a right to join our community of values."
"However, and I am equally resolute on this point, if there is a danger that enlargement will lead to the break up or the dilution of the European Union in the sense that, in the end, we will merely be an economic and financial institution and not a political union, if this is the danger which enlargement holds, then we should say no to enlargement."
"What I mean is that we need to make reforms first."
"I can only urge the Council of Ministers to make every effort to give this Intergovernmental Conference a comprehensive mandate and to ensure that the European Parliament' s two representatives are allowed to attend the conference on equal terms."
"We are debating defence policy, an issue which we have supported here in Parliament for decades."
"We need European defence."
"But when we talk of European defence, we also mean practical measures."
"For example, I am most worried by the cuts in defence spending in my country."
"In other words, we will not achieve what we say we want to achieve and that really would be a pity."
"Talking about European defence and including European defence in the Treaties makes no sense if we put no flesh on the bones, which is why it is important to put flesh on the bones, to create the capacities, but without standing in opposition to our American partners and our allies in the USA."
"We do not want to oppose America, we want to stand on an equal footing and we want to act in partnership."
"If we take this approach, the western alliance also stands to gain."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I hope that Mrs Halonen will have time, before the Summit, to read our motion for a resolution on this Summit, together with the report on the Intergovernmental Conference which we approved in November. I am saying this because I missed some of her thoughts on certain points which are absolutely vital in our opinion."
"We are certainly now facing an historic challenge in terms of advancing and consolidating the Union and reorganising it in order to cope with enlargement."
"My colleague, Mr Hänsch, will talk specifically about enlargement in detail."
"I will restrict myself to the over-enlargement caused by our relationship with Turkey."
"I can say that the Socialist Group is unanimous on this."
"We do believe it is advisable to adopt a positive position with regard to Turkey."
"However, firstly, Turkey must show willing."
"It cannot just expect and it is therefore vital how it acts in the Öçalan case."
"Secondly, a plan of action must be prepared."
"Returning to the very balanced position of this House on the Intergovernmental Conference, the Council must not adopt a low-key approach to this issue."
"Enlargement is a major political ambition and we have to know how to respond to this. We cannot simply say that there are some reforms to be made on a few remaining points or that this is an issue to be resolved only in terms of costs."
"We have to be capable of providing the major political impetus needed for this process."
"I also place great importance on something which has hardly been mentioned. We are carrying out a parallel exercise of constitutionalising the Treaties, by preparing a Charter of Fundamental Rights, at the same time as planning the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have an obligation to our fellow citizens - and note that the President-in-Office of the Council comes from a Nordic country which is always boasting about transparency - to achieve a transparent process in which this House is duly represented. I would like Mrs Halonen to reject the view expressed that the Council Presidency is opposed to full representation of the European Parliament, with two representatives, at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We must also explain to our political forces, to our national MPs and to our people, why we are holding the IGC, why we want a Charter of Fundamental Rights, why we want enlargement and why we have the responsibility of ensuring that the Community operates as a community."
"On defence there is one point about which I am very pleased. The President-in-Office of the Council, who comes from a tradition of neutrality, has become an expert on security and defence."
"She is to be congratulated on this."
"Finally, I must refer to the absolutely fundamental issue of growth, stability and employment."
"This is an issue on which the line taken in Luxembourg, and then in Cardiff, Cologne and Helsinki, must be consolidated at the next Summit under the Portuguese Presidency. We realise that, to have a prosperous future in the Union, we must be capable of being more competitive and generating more economic growth, but with the emphasis on employment and social cohesion which are, and must be, our first priorities."
"These are the challenges which my group wants the Helsinki Summit to respond to in a positive manner."
"Mr President, the President of the Council says that she always appreciates the trips she makes to the Parliament, so it is rather extraordinary that she failed during her speech to respond to any of the proposals of Parliament for the IGC."
"This rather reinforces the press reports, which give cause for concern, that the European Council has chosen a narrow agenda for the IGC and a merely voluntary charter."
"If that is so, it says a lot about the way the Union is squaring up for the challenge of enlargement."
"An IGC that failed to amend the way the treaties can be revised in future and in policy sectors to soften them would be an IGC that threatened to paralyse the Union when it tries to modernise itself following the accession of new Member States."
"An IGC that failed to grant the citizen improved access to the European Court means a charter will be more of a public relations exercise than a powerful re-definition of European citizenship."
"And a Union that is frightened to reinforce its liberal and parliamentary character will be an unattractive Union for the acceding Member States and an unreliable player upon the world stage."
"Where Europe stops should not be a question of geography but of liberal values and democratic practices, clearly defined and brightly illuminated so that the candidate countries know where the European journey will bring them."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in addition to those issues already mentioned here, we are expecting - and someone has already referred to this - the Helsinki Summit to promote protection of the environment and to at last place environmental protection at the heart of Union action."
"We must now take a definite step forward on this issue, as we know how difficult it has been to put a stop to negative developments with regard to the environment, and we are expecting determination and concrete results from you in the areas of business, industry and agriculture."
"As regards the economy in general, the current struggle to harmonise indirect taxation is certainly an illustrative example of how we will not make any headway in this area if we insist on unanimity."
"I have followed Mrs Halonen' s battle with the City of London bankers, and I believe that there will be no end to this struggle until we can decide the issue of taxation by means of a qualified majority. This will therefore be an important task for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"Otherwise we will be leaving questions of taxation for the markets to decide, and that is something we surely do not want."
"The subject that will surely live on after the Helsinki Summit is, however, concrete decisions on a common security arrangement."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council specifically as you very laudably raised the point that civil and military crisis management complement one another and they should be examined and decided on together."
"The European Union does indeed have such an advantage, compared, for example, with NATO."
"The European Union is, after all, a civil organisation, and if it now develops a military crisis management capacity, we can also trust it to consider the wisdom that says it is always better to prevent crises rather than try to calm things down through the use of force."
"We can resort to that when all else has failed."
"You mentioned that for civil crisis management we need the police: I would like to add that other ordinary professional groups, such as psychologists and social workers, as well as plumbers and builders, can be needed in non-military crisis management."
"Our group was most satisfied when it heard recently that High Representative Xavier Solana had started to look into a parliamentary initiative for the establishment of civil crisis management troops."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned a Millennium Declaration: it seems the Council has also been bitten by the millennium bug."
"You have spoken in favour of transparency, but this is surely one of the most closely guarded state secrets there is. So perhaps you could give us a tiny hint about what kind of tracks we will be leaving at the millennium celebrations."
"Mr President, we have heard a great deal about this new enlargement strategy, which Mr Prodi has also proposed to us in the past."
"Some aspects of it are appealing and sound, some are threatening."
"Mr Prodi was not in the least convincing when it came to the following question: is political unification the price for the new strategy?"
"We are particularly worried about this. We are worried that this strategy will somehow lead to a twin-track Europe - i.e. the 15 versus the rest - and that many aspects of unification are being sidelined."
"The second reason this worries us is on account of the Intergovernmental Conference: there is an air of vagueness and stubbornness about it and its narrow agenda only addresses procedural issues."
"What about the political issues, what we might call the intergovernmental economic management of EMU, Mr President; in other words, what about political intervention?"
"What about the common policy on unemployment, or on employment for that matter?"
"Are these not issues which are relevant to unification, issues which concern the very people from whom the Union is apparently distancing itself?"
"The third issue is Turkey."
"Do the Council and the Commission know exactly what Turkey wants?"
"We are convinced by numerous declarations that some people in Turkey just want 'symbolic recognition' , purely for internal reasons, and do not take their future in Europe seriously."
"That is no good to anyone, either in Europe or in Turkey."
"If we want to make ourselves clear and if we want to stop bandying words and leading Turkey up the garden path, then we should send it a signal which says that, of course, Turkey will not be discriminated against, that goes without saying; however, we need to be clear as to what Turkey' s future within Europe will actually entail."
"We need a material policy which Turkey can verify and which allows it to head along the right path: the path towards the rule of law, good neighbourliness and peaceful coexistence, as well as towards a withdrawal from military operations everywhere, especially in Cyprus and on the Kurdish question."
"Mr President, all Members of the European Union can take solace from the fact that the European Union economy is performing well and that we have permanent democratic structures operating in all our respective jurisdictions."
"This is not the case for all countries in Europe at this time and that is why I welcome the efforts of the Finnish Government to pursue the adoption of a strategy on the Western Balkans at the forthcoming Helsinki Summit."
"A permanent stabilisation of the region is in the interests of the European Union as a whole."
"The European Union and the Member States together constitute the most important donors in the region and besides humanitarian aid, the region has received this year EU aid amounting to EUR 2,100 m."
"We support democratic change in Yugoslavia and the European Union has rightly started to implement pilot projects based on the energy-for-democracy initiative."
"EU enlargement will be another central theme at the Helsinki Summit."
"During the Finnish Presidency, accession negotiations have been opened in respect of seven more chapters of talks."
"These concern EMU, social policy and employment, the free movement of capital, the free movement of services, taxation, energy, transport, all of which are very demanding social and economic sectors."
"I am particularly pleased to see that the chapter dealing with energy has now commenced."
"I say this because the safety of nuclear plants in Eastern and Central Europe has been a cause for great concern in recent years, and will continue to be."
"The Union cannot hide from the naked fact that the EU itself, together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will have to play a key role in terms of financial contributions and technical support to make safe all these nuclear reactors sooner rather than later."
"We all know that the enlargement process cannot take place unless there is some internal reform in the decision-making processes within the EU."
"The Presidency is independently preparing a comprehensive report on questions to be examined at the IGC and on the various options for resolving them."
"The deadline being set down for the next IGC is very ambitious indeed."
"I support working towards reaching agreement by the end of next year, but equally we must not, and should not, hurry possible fundamental reforms to existing EU treaties without due consideration and evaluation."
"Mr President, I am, of course, only speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members."
"We understand that the Council is disgracefully preparing to exclude the European Parliament from the Intergovernmental Conference and, above all, that it is preparing to ensure that the conference will only tackle three items related to the improvement of the functioning of the institutions, thereby leaving that incomprehensible house of cards known as the Treaty of the Union entirely intact."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, today the Union is an institution which does not respect the minimum parameters of democracy and the Rule of Law, and for us Radicals, European federalists, advocates of the United States of Europe as envisaged by Altiero Spinelli, it is difficult to consider the minor - and they really are minor - reforms on the agenda as real progress."
"Of course, we are utopians and you are realists, such realists that the Berlin Wall has been down for ten years, and ten years on we are still unable to enlarge eastwards, just as we were unable to intervene to stop the genocide, first in Bosnia and then in Kosovo."
"This is because the European Union' s strength is increasingly bureaucratic power, a pervasive bureaucracy that desires to take control of everything, under the ideological illusion that the law and the parliamentary process are obstacles that needlessly slow down reform."
"I believe that Parliament should not be satisfied with just asking to participate in proceedings at the conference, such as the work on drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights, but that it should demand the right to be able to act as a real parliament and it should demand that its right to decide independently on its own seat be restored at the Intergovernmental Conference so that it is not forced to work with its secretariat spread between three different locations."
"This could be a first tangible step towards allowing Parliament to be a real parliament."
"In fact, there is no doubt about the agenda for the Summit."
"It will be planning the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to the enlargement of the European Union."
"A drastic extension to the Union' s powers is on the agenda."
"These are the crucial building blocks for a United States of the European Union, that is to say for a real federal State."
"There is one significant point I want to concentrate on in my speech, namely the Commission' s remark in its contribution for the Summit to the effect that, if the political will is sufficiently strong, it will be possible to conclude the planned Intergovernmental Conference successfully before the end of the year 2000."
"One wonders whose political will are we talking about?"
"Earlier, I heard one speaker say that we must be careful not to lose our citizens."
"Yes, but is that not putting the cart before the horse?"
"Is it not our citizens who govern our society, or is it ourselves, sitting here and fashioning democracy?"
"What kind of absurdity is this?"
"If the people of Europe were to be asked whether they wanted the kind of empire-building that is on the agenda, extremely different answers would be obtained."
"We have asked this question in Denmark, for example."
"On the few occasions we did ask the people - and we also asked the French people in 1992 - we received an answer indicating very serious public reservations about such a development."
"But our citizens are not being asked, and my advice to this Intergovernmental Conference, before the empire-building gets too well under way, is: ask the people of Europe whether they want developments to take this course."
"I personally am sure of the answer."
"This is something they do not want."
"We have already lost our citizens, as may be very clearly seen from the results and the turnout at the last elections to this Parliament."
"Mr President, numerous aspects of enlargement have been raised, together with the economic, social and democratic implications."
"I am certain that all these issues will be resolved in the medium or long term."
"But one problem calls for immediate resolution."
"I refer to the closure of high-risk nuclear reactors."
"An accident would affect the whole of Europe and the longer these reactors are working the greater the likelihood of total meltdown."
"It is therefore imperative that binding arrangements for the decommissioning of high risk reactors be agreed before accession negotiations begin."
"Allow me to give you just one example of the nuclear policy of an applicant country: Slovakia' s technocrats and bureaucrats promised under the Communist regime to decommission Bohunice in the year 2000."
"Obviously they recognised the risk."
"Now, no-one knows anything about any such promise."
"Just as past promises have not been honoured, there is a danger, if guaranteed decommissioning is not demanded in advance, that they will once again be forgotten."
"Mr President, Mrs Halonen, Mr Prodi, we Finns know that we do not give thanks when there are good grounds for doing so, but we are quick to criticise."
"I will surprise the Finnish representatives of the country to hold the presidency by saying that the Finnish Presidency can already now be termed, in the positive sense, historic."
"At the Summit conference in Tampere, we included internal and police affairs among Community issues in an attempt to increase citizens' security."
"The fight against organised crime, above all against the spread of drugs, will become more effective as the decisions are implemented."
"At Tampere, we decided to draft a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which the European Parliament will also be fully involved."
"The meeting at Helsinki will deal with joint crisis management and the resources to be allocated to it, along with a timetable for this joint action."
"According to a new opinion poll, this enjoys the support of a clear majority in my country."
"This step towards a common foreign and defence policy, in close cooperation with NATO, is an important part of civil, economic and political crisis management."
"The Intergovernmental Conference, at which next year will be decided the institutional changes that are required within the Community as a condition for enlargement, will have its roots in, and receive its agenda from, Helsinki."
"At Helsinki, the status of the new applicant countries will also be decided, which means that the artificial division in Eastern and Central Europe into better and poorer candidates will end."
"But is our own house in order at present, and what must the people of those countries trying to join the Community think about this patent protectionism, which undermines the basic work of the Community in the economic sector?"
"What measures might be imposed in time on their relatively low-income citizens and on their companies competing in the Community?"
"For example, Spain still holds back from the all-important creation of the European limited company, the United Kingdom safeguards City jobs by refusing to accept the harmonisation of taxation even as regards the taxation of capital, France would rather go to the Community court than liberalise its electricity market as required by Union legislation, the German Chancellor breaks all the rules of the market economy and rescues a construction company on the brink of bankruptcy in order to gain political kudos in his home country, and the beef war against England continues far beyond the requirements of health."
"How can we be contemplating enlargement if we are still fighting in the current EU area in a manner that goes against the rules of the Single Market?"
"European competitiveness is not strong now either, the markets in the Community are not functioning correctly and the process whereby differences in consumer goods prices in the EMU area would be evened out has ground to a halt."
"My examples in no way mean that I exclude the possibility of the rules being broken in my country as well."
"I only wish to say that the future aims in Helsinki are good ones, but our own European house must also be put in order in accordance with the rules of the Union."
"Mr President, the whole house agrees with Mrs Halonen: Helsinki must inject new life into the process of enlargement of the European Union."
"The individual negotiations which we want to conduct with 12 applicant countries should not become mere routine."
"The last Intergovernmental Conference of the century marks the end of a millennium of European wars and you must ensure, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that the foundations are laid so that there will never again be another millennium of wars in Europe."
"That is the aim of enlargement, to unite the whole of Europe in a European Union."
"Mrs Halonen, we support what you have said regarding the negotiations and how they are to be conducted and are also in agreement with what Mr Prodi has said on the matter."
"We find that all well and good, but what you have said about the preparation of accession, about the so-called Amsterdam leftovers, that is not enough for us."
"We want comprehensive reform of the European Union."
"If we are to open the doors of the European house, of our European Union, in order to take in another 12 lodgers in addition to the 15 already living here, then one visit from the cleaner is not enough, we need to convert the whole house."
"That is something I have heard too little about, not only from you, but also from the other governments of the European Union."
"I know what you are thinking and perhaps what your intentions are: let us just begin with a few minor reforms at this Intergovernmental Conference and then, after next year' s Intergovernmental Conference, there will be another Intergovernmental Conference and so on and so forth."
"I put it to you that the people of the European Union are tired of seeing the EU stumble from one Intergovernmental Conference to the next, taking so many tiny steps that they no longer know which direction they are going in."
"We must show them once and for all what our image of the European Union and of the future of Europe is, instead of watching the EU constantly stumbling from one conference to the next."
"With regard to the common defence policy, we welcome the statement which you have made today, but there must be more to European summits than statements and papers."
"We want you to take the decisions needed in Helsinki so that concrete initiatives can be introduced into both military and non-military aspects of the common defence policy and to stipulate the operational capacities needed and the institutions in which the decisions are to be taken."
"Finally, we want, on the day after Helsinki, on 12 December, to be able to talk about a real European Summit, a Summit from which we can look out into the new millennium and not just a mole-hill without a view."
"You have the responsibility and the opportunity to ensure that the Finnish Presidency at the end of this century goes down in history as a great presidency!"
"Mr President, there are two particularly important issues to be debated at the Helsinki Summit: Union enlargement and setting the IGC in motion."
"As we adopted the broad resolution on the IGC in the previous part-session at Strasbourg, we should have focused this time mainly on Union enlargement."
"Unfortunately, the joint resolution drafted by the groups only contains a few paragraphs on enlargement."
"The group of the European Liberal Democrats has tabled some amendments that would complement and improve the jointly prepared draft."
"We hope that the Commission and the Council will draft an overall strategy, in which enlargement of the Union and its future reforms might be linked to a broader pan-European scenario."
"In our opinion, we should consider various models of differentiated integration and try to achieve an ever-developing, concentrically conceived Union, in which there would be a federal core and a less integrated outer perimeter."
"We furthermore propose that the Union should use the European Council and the OSCE as forums for pan-European cooperation."
"We hope there will be support for our proposal."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that the Commission has made a long overdue move towards revision of the enlargement strategy."
"But that should not blind us to the fact that the enlargement strategy has still not actually been revised in certain areas, namely with regard to aid, transparency and parity."
"There is still no public debate in these countries, no social dialogue, no involvement at regional or local level; what we take for granted cannot happen there because the EU instruments do not allow it."
"I would also like to point out how important it is for the presidency to inject new life into this forum with a new European conference and to involve these future EU members equally in the new configuration of the European Union."
"This applies both to institutional reforms and to the common objective of meeting the Kyoto objectives."
"Mr President, the European Council of 10 and 11 December 1999 in Helsinki will launch the next Intergovernmental Conference intended to revise the EC Treaty with a view to enlargement. However, a minimalist agenda appears to have been set for this IGC, basically limited to the three points left open by the Treaty of Amsterdam: composition of the Commission, weighting of votes in Council and a further extension of qualified majority voting."
"This agenda will not in any way help to solve the EU' s problems in terms of enlargement which is therefore likely to be undertaken under the worst institutional conditions."
"We certainly understand the Council' s dislike of the shameless attempts by the Commission in recent months to force through, along the lines of the Dehaene report, the idea of another major federalist leap forward."
"On the other hand, the Council is now accepting the inclusion on the agenda of a proposal of the same type, namely the extension of qualified majority voting. This was not even envisaged by the Amsterdam Protocol on the institutions, and appeared only in an annexed statement of three Member States."
"This proposal, inspired by the idea of a standardised and standardising Europe, is by no means the solution which will allow Europe to operate with 27 members or more."
"In our opinion, if the Council really wants to carry out innovative work, it should ditch the Commission' s proposals and ignore the Amsterdam leftovers. It should put just one subject on the negotiating table, namely decision making in an enlarged Union."
"This one subject would mean having to jointly consider three consequences which are logically linked. These are qualified majority voting in certain cases, the enshrinement of the Luxembourg compromise in all cases and increased flexibility in cooperation according to a differentiated scale."
"In this way, we would have to consider what really brings us together, without blindly accepting the acquis communautaire as a taboo area, and how the common institutions will operate in a Union which uses this differentiated scale."
"If we do not make this effort to change, if we hold on to rigid ideas like limpets to a rock, either enlargement will fail or the Union will be swept away. It is our choice."
"Mr President, the Helsinki Summit would like clarity on the matter."
"The European Union must ensure that the enlargement process is not slowed down because institutional reforms have not taken place within the Union."
"The European Commission' s transparency concerning candidate countries should be adopted by the European Summit."
"What will a Union comprising more than 25 Members actually look like?"
"Moreover, Turkey requires special treatment in the accession strategy."
"It also remains unclear what will change for Turkey now that this State is being treated as a candidate country, although there is absolutely no question of accession taking place as yet."
"The agenda for the IGC in 2000 must list more items than the three leftovers from Amsterdam."
"The attitude regarding the accession process displayed by people within candidate countries remains worrying."
"In this respect, it is important to develop a clear information strategy."
"In fact, the same applies just as much to public opinion within the EU Member States."
"Otherwise, the value of an enlarged Union will remain vague to the average European citizen."
"The composition of the European institutions must be changed in good time."
"It is hoped that the Summit will draw up a schedule for this."
"Mr President, as former rapporteur on the enlargement strategy I of course welcome with open arms the new proposals submitted to the Council by the Commission once and for all to eliminate the unfortunate dichotomy between candidate countries, once and for all."
"Also, I could not agree more with the reason given in this respect."
"We used exactly the same reason for promoting the so-called ""Regatta model"" which did a great deal more justice to the own merits and efforts of the countries that wanted to join the European Union."
"Indeed, if we say to the most developed of the candidate countries: you are already in really, then they will sit back and no longer put in the same effort."
"We witnessed this in the case of the Czech Republic: policy stagnated."
"Other less developed countries, such as Bulgaria and Romania, will be discouraged and will lose the backing of the people for hard-line measures."
"Thankfully, this bizarre division into two groups is also being rescinded."
"I highly commend the Council, in anticipation that is, for the fact that it is going to implement these changes and this strategy in accordance with the original Parliament position."
"It is extremely important that the European Parliament puts its own house in order too."
"We need a swift victory during the Intergovernmental Conference in 2000."
"We need to start reforming our institutions ourselves, to democratise ourselves."
"We require candidate countries to develop their institutions and ensure that they operate democratically."
"Imagine if we did not need to meet these requirements ourselves."
"I am, therefore, extremely taken aback by what Mr Van den Berg, from the [Dutch] Labour Party, wrote in a letter published recently which stated, in so many words, that the Union' s reform should no longer be a prerequisite for enlargement."
"How can it not be?"
"I am extremely pleased that the leaders in the socialist group here do not subscribe to this view."
"Indeed, only if one does not operate with the best of intentions for the European Union can one say that we do not need to put our own house in order."
"We could easily offer the new Member States a house which will turn into a heap of rubble."
"They are entitled to more."
"They are entitled to democratically functioning institutions within the EU, of which they want to become members and which can take effective decisions."
"We should not offer them anything less."
"Anyone who wants to focus only on the EU' s achievements as a free trade zone should just continue making this type of proposal."
"The reproach implicit in his letter that the Union actually regulates far too much at national, regional and local level, is also striking."
"Only hardened supporters of Mrs Thatcher talk in this way about decentralisation of Union policy."
"It is genuinely not the case that we rob national, regional and local governments of duties which belong there."
"Quite the opposite, in fact; subsidiarity is held in very high esteem here."
"Anyone who denies this is making a mockery of our work."
"In my opinion, all Member States should make a proper and sound contribution to the public debate on the European Union and we can bring this about, for example, by ensuring that insignificant issues which take us away from the real issues dealt with by the European Union are abandoned, the type of issues raised by the entire delegation brought by Mr Van den Berg."
"I applaud the fact that we are going to develop a European Security and Defence Policy without weakening transatlantic relations and the link with NATO."
"I am extremely happy that we both, that is Mr Hänsch and I, also clearly agreed on this point, highlighting nevertheless that the European Union really prefers non-military means."
"This is simply a fact."
"But we also know that non-military means and diplomatic means often only really work if a credible, military threat is present in the background."
"I think that as far as this is concerned, we have learnt our lesson."
"The European Union has been dangerous because it was unable to split sovereign power in terms of security and defence policy."
"This is now changing, fortunately."
"Mr President, I herewith wish the Council the best of luck with the proposals we are submitting and I hope that the Council will, in good time, listen to the European Parliament regarding these other issues as well."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Europe has undergone substantial change over the last ten years."
"The development that began with the turning point in autumn 1989 has reached a stage of controlled progress, thanks to the determined policies of the European Union."
"We have laid down clear guidelines for Europe' s development, but there is work still to be done."
"The Intergovernmental Conference, the reality of a common foreign and security policy and the controlled realisation of enlargement are matters that have to be thoroughly prepared for, both in the applicant countries and in the European Union."
"These areas form an important whole on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council and, as has been said here, this whole is so dynamic that if everything succeeds, the Helsinki meeting will be an historic event."
"The importance of these matters means that it is vital that Parliament also debates the issue thoroughly."
"We are now in a situation where, for the first time, full consideration must be given to the Treaty of Amsterdam in a meeting of the European Council."
"The President-in-Office of the Council' s excellent speech fully covered the questions and challenges of a common security and defence policy for the Union."
"We should point out that the Helsinki Summit will focus on the European Union' s policy on the northern dimension and hence bring about more solid tools of stability and security for the northern part of Europe."
"When we speak of security, peace and stability in Europe, we should not forget, however, the factors that have an impact on internal security in society."
"A respect for fundamental rights and aspirations towards social equality are the best defence policy for ensuring social stability."
"The European employment policy and the guidelines on employment for the year 2000 to be discussed at Helsinki as a part of that policy still belong at the top of the Union' s agenda."
"The defence of democracy and the prevention of extremism are the basis of social justice, which means, among other things, combating unemployment."
"Finally, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to the country to hold the presidency for having succeeded, with no amendments to regulations, this has not yet been possible, in clearly increasing transparency in the decision-making process in the European Union and especially, in the European Council."
"Hopefully, future countries to hold the presidency will carry on the good work."
"Mr President, my remarks will concern security aspects of today' s debate."
"Members of the House may not be aware of an ill-judged intervention into national politics by the Secretary-General of NATO today."
"Lord Robertson just recently attacked as isolationist the Scottish National Party' s policy concerning NATO membership."
"That policy, I should tell you, is equivalent in effect to the stance of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and also Ireland, though the occasion of Lord Robertson's intervention was Ireland's accession to the Partnership for Peace Programme."
"I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council would deplore, as I do, a party political intervention by the Secretary-General of NATO, the logical implication of which is an attack on the defence policy of Finland and other Member States."
"For the record, I should like to make it clear that, in common with all our colleagues in the Green European Free Alliance, we in the SNP are committed to the idea of collective security in Europe and welcome developments the Council will pursue to this end."
"But we are rootedly opposed to the maintenance of nuclear weapons in Scottish coastal waters, or coastal waters anywhere in Europe, or the land of Europe."
"This is a determining factor for defence policy as far as we are concerned, and I do not for a moment imagine that Ireland is in the process of developing a policy aimed at giving hospitality to nuclear weapons in their waters."
"Indeed, Mr Collins assured me that this has nothing to do with NATO membership."
"I hope that in developing our crisis management policy, we in Europe will think carefully as to where, if anywhere, nuclear weapons belong in it."
"I do not think they belong at all."
"Mr President, here, in this Chamber, I would like to express strong concern and, if I may say so, some pessimism regarding the developments that are taking shape regarding the forthcoming Summit."
"Parliament has expressed a very clear position."
"It has voiced the hope that some major institutional reforms will be unalterably implemented before enlargement takes place if we do not want Europe to turn into a large area of free trade and nothing more, where regulations and internal rules that are now obsolete leave it distinctly incapable of making decisions; it has also stated that decisions on majority voting and membership of the committees are not sufficient to give fresh impetus and new strength to Europe, but that some other avenues should be taken, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and certain other elements that should have united the whole of the great European movement: all this, of course, must be in full respect for the nations, their feelings, their history and their traditions, which I consider to be extremely important."
"However, what I think I have understood - since we are not blind - is that at the forthcoming conference, caution and realism are likely to prevail over audacity and courage."
"But at an historic time such as this, when we either have the courage to take a giant step forwards or else risk being condemned to a lengthy period of impotency, I think that audacity and courage count for more than realism."
"I therefore extend an invitation to all those who believe in these goals, in these objectives, to be firm and determined, and we have here with us President Prodi who has declared this several times, and I know he believes it."
"I also invite the European Parliament to meet immediately after Helsinki - if, as I fear, the conclusion will be progress, but too limited - and with a very open mind and great courage to take responsibility for all of its decisions, saying and thinking, as at other times in European history, that Parliament has great possibilities and a significant role to play."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to confine myself to two comments regarding the Helsinki Summit."
"The first concerns the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It seems clear from what the Minister has said that the Cologne conclusions will not be the only three items on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"In my opinion, it is only right that issues relating to common foreign policy, defence and the economy should be discussed."
"However, it would be wrong just to stick to these few issues and ignore matters relating to the future structure and legal identity of the European Union, or social and cultural issues."
"I should like, at this juncture, to point out that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is of the utmost importance, and we should ensure that it evolves into a binding text and does not just remain a simple declaration of intent."
"My second comment concerns the position of Turkey."
"We must tread very carefully on this issue at the Helsinki Summit, because this ties in closely with the fact that Turkey has yet to demonstrate in its policies that it has understood that close relations with Europe depend on its fulfilling certain conditions, as laid down in EU texts and decisions."
"The question which arises here concerns the extension of the borders of Europe, especially with enlargement in the offing, and of whether or not the borders are to be extended to include Turkey."
"These are, in my view, important issues which we must bear in mind."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would also like to express my satisfaction with the strategy, which is generally sensible and coherent as far as enlargement is concerned."
"However, although this vision, which is held both by the Council and the Commission on the issue of enlargement, may be ambitious, the same cannot be said about the content of the forthcoming IGC. In fact, what we have on the table now is merely a continuation of what could not be achieved in Amsterdam."
"I would say there is ""plenty of ambition for enlargement and yet very little ambition for a revision of the Treaty of the Union itself"" ."
"There is even greater cause for concern when what we want to revise, that is the famous institutional triangle, is defended on the basis of an argument for efficiency and not on the basis of an overall vision of the European project."
"I do not think that anyone will be happy if the Intergovernmental Conference at the end of 2000 results in the Commission or the Council taking decisions in two hours which they previously took in five, six or seven."
"The project of European construction does not rest on the criterion of efficiency but on the criterion of cohesion and what we all hope is that, in Helsinki, a political agenda is set, and not a technical agenda with complicated political consequences."
"In this regard, I would like to welcome the Portuguese Presidency' s willingness to grant the European Parliament' s representatives at this IGC the same status that will be given to the Commission as far as the personal representatives of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs are concerned."
"It also appears important that we take advantage of the Portuguese Presidency' s willingness to have the IGC start not in March but, if possible, as early as January."
"As for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it is important that it is able not only to extend the rights that are already laid down in Charters and Treaties but also that it recognises rights in the social and economic spheres and, above all, that it is able to be innovative and creative in the area of new rights concerning environmental issues and the protection of consumer rights."
"I shall now address a third point to which President Barón Crespo has already referred, concerning employment issues. The Union cannot only attempt to deal with employment issues when we are going through periods of economic slowdown."
"Our policies should be active, not reactive. We must take advantage of the current economic cycle and of the declaration that the Finnish Presidency will be making on the Millennium and the new information society, so that we find a creative way of recording sustained growth and so that the goal of full employment is actually achieved and does not remain a rhetorical phrase."
"Finally, Mr President, I also support you in your intention to have the strategic lines that were laid down in the Tampere Council conclusions approved, specifically in the fight against drug trafficking, and I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be willing to adopt its own action plan in the next six-monthly term."
") Mr President, it is a real pity that the Intergovernmental Conference will not be considering certain essential elements on the area of freedom, security and justice, none of which can be achieved at the expense of the others."
"I also regret that our joint motion for a resolution does not mention the problems linked to Eurodac, even though the Council has just announced, contrary to the Treaties, that this body should remain purely intergovernmental. This would, of course, exclude the European Parliament and the Court of Justice from any control in this area."
"Similarly, faced with the multiplication of information systems such as Europol and Eurodac, this House should have repeated its demand for an independent commission on data processing and the protection of privacy in order to preserve our individual freedoms, in addition to democratic and judicial control."
"The idea of citizenship is also most notably absent from this text."
"Yet this is a subject of vital importance. It is a cornerstone of the negotiations on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also on the constitutionalisation of the Union."
"When the Union is enlarged, it is this citizenship which must be at the heart of our European project in order to ensure human and sustainable development."
"To conclude, we must realise that such a pale and insipid text cannot satisfy the people of Europe."
"We must take care that we do not distance ourselves too much from their aspirations if we are to build a fairer and more democratic Europe with a greater sense of solidarity."
"Mr President, I wish the Finnish Presidency every success at the Helsinki Summit as this will conclude a range of important work undertaken during its term."
"With regard to the issues mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, the shape of the Union following enlargement raises no problems for this House, for the Commission proposal or for the Council of Ministers."
"On the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference, such an optimistic situation is not appropriate in view of the tour by the Finnish Prime Minister."
"It would be a pity to miss this opportunity of giving a boost to the project of European integration and we will regret not having taken due advantage of this occasion."
"I completely agree with Mrs Halonen' s assessment that it is absolutely essential to reaffirm the international presence of the European Union. This is particularly true in the fields of security and defence to which the Finnish Presidency - and this can be said with legitimate pride - has given a decisive boost with this historic meeting of Defence and Foreign Ministers."
"Furthermore, we must stress the need to consolidate the achievements made at the Tampere Summit, referred to by the previous speaker, on an area of freedom, security and justice."
"As mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, it is essential that we confirm and prepare the work of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to employment."
"We are at an all-time low in the short history of the euro so the Helsinki European Council should devote some time to the issue of the external representation of the euro zone."
"Mrs Halonen, you referred to the need for us to promote a more open, democratic and transparent European integration project."
"I noted with satisfaction the comment made by the President of the Commission on the presence of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference, but I would like you to say this as well."
"We cannot achieve a more open, transparent and democratic Europe if the European Parliament is not fully involved in the work of the IGC."
"I hope and pray that the European Council in Helsinki can give us a Europe which is more judicious, more united and much more community-spirited, and therefore much less intergovernmental."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to express, first of all, my surprise at what the President-in-Office of the Council said about the Intergovernmental Conference: Mrs Halonen did not even mention the European Parliament' s resolution of 18 November and the proposals it contains on the agenda of the Conference."
"They are serious and justified proposals, not escapist flights of fancy or vain utopian desires."
"I do not think it is right to take this attitude towards an important stance adopted by Parliament."
"We already know everything about the three leftovers from Amsterdam: all that remains is to make the choices that were not made during the previous conference."
"We should take a year just to do this."
"May I say that it is ridiculous to uphold this."
"Take heed: if the Council, if the governments do not open up the agenda of the Helsinki Summit to essential institutional issues that are now more than ready to be addressed, the debate on enlargement will lack credibility and we will show ourselves incapable of having a far-sighted view of the development of all aspects of the Union."
"President Prodi, I do not understand what the preparatory work outside the Intergovernmental Conference you spoke of should be."
"You seemed to be entrusting to this strange forum some of the issues that were put forward here by the Commission on 10 November."
"I hope that you will keep all those Commission proposals on the agenda and the conference approach unchanged, and will contribute in this way to a positive outcome of the Helsinki Council."
"Mr President, I think that President Prodi did well in his intervention, all of which we should agree with, to say that enlargement is the main and essential point for Helsinki."
"Parliament had already been stressing for some time the inadequacy of the approach adopted by the Commission and the Council on enlargement."
"I think it was a question of a strategic and political error, the consequences of which were fortunately limited by the Commission' s change of mind, even though, I must say, it is sad to think that perhaps it was only the war which we experienced on our doorstep that pushed them towards this new strategy."
"It is right to begin negotiations with all the applicant states, but there is no doubt that we must differentiate between these countries, given that the levels of adaptation to Europe vary greatly between them."
"Of course, it seems difficult to talk about accession dates, even if it would be useful, very useful, in order to facilitate public opinion in the countries concerned, given that it is increasingly obvious that it is a risk: negotiations that are too lengthy may cool enthusiasm, both in Member States as well as applicant states, as shown by the recent opinion polls carried out in Poland and as I personally saw in this country from where I returned yesterday."
"We would therefore lose an historic opportunity, to quote President Prodi again."
"I am absolutely convinced that the accession of a new Member State must be the result of a broad consensus between political groups but, above all, the majority of the populations concerned should be in agreement."
"Therefore, we need - and this is my invitation to Parliament - to draw particular attention to the information campaigns which keep support for the European option in these countries at a high level."
"In this respect, I think that the PHARE programme may be the appropriate instrument, and I therefore think that it must be consolidated precisely in this area."
"Mr President, allow me to pick up where my colleague Mr Gawronski left off, namely the acceptance of Europe among the people of the various countries seeking to join the European Union."
"It is not only Poland; other countries, such as the Czech Republic, also keep their enthusiasm for the European Union in check."
"I should like to point out that the Commission' s progress report on the Czech Republic refers to a medium-sized town in the Czechia where a fence has been built down a street to separate the Czechs from the Romas."
"That is hardly progress."
"I have been there twice, I have spoken to the mayor, I said the fence must go and what happened?"
"The tabloid press of Europe is calling this fence a wall, as if it were not only the Berlin wall but the great wall of China."
"It has been so blown up that the people there are, understandably, extremely angry because they assume that there is sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander in the European Union."
"We have one set of rules for ourselves, and we are far from whiter than white, and we have another set of rules for applicant countries and we expect everything of them which we ourselves fail to deliver."
"When we in the European Union take a look around us, at ethnic conflicts and terrorist attacks, I think that, if the boot were on the other foot, for example, if the Czech Republic were already in the Union, then it would say to a certain Member State: friend, if you do not get your house in order, then you must wait another twenty years before you become a Member State."
"I simply mean we should make sure that the people are not put off."
"The point is, we do not need to get on with the politicians in the applicant countries, but with the people."
"That is all that counts."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by congratulating the Finnish Presidency on what has, on the whole, been a good six months."
"I should like to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, for enabling the EU' s foreign and security policy, including its military capability, to be discussed so thoroughly today."
"The EU can now, within the framework of the Amsterdam Treaty, increase its credibility where commitment to freedom and peace in Europe are concerned."
"The Helsinki Summit is, in that respect, a test for Europe' s present leadership."
"Is there the will and the courage to get together to formulate, and give depth to, a policy which enables the people of Europe to see that there is force and not only words behind the desire to prevent human catastrophes such as that in Kosovo?"
"Just as important a test of leadership is that involved in guaranteeing that the enlargement of the European Union can be carried out with the first new Member States acceding to the Union during the present term of office."
"In Helsinki, the preliminary values are being laid down for the Intergovernmental Conference which is to solve any remaining questions of power."
"We must have a European Union with the power to take decisions."
"Wishes for the future ought not, however, to be allowed to outstrip the historic task of taking advantage now of the historical opportunity to unify the whole of Europe."
"The Finnish Presidency and the Summit must hand over the baton to Portugal with one unequivocal goal: to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference in Paris with a view to making an open, cooperative Europe, united in a common purpose, into a reality and one which will make place great demands upon leadership, the capacity for change and the willingness to quarrel less over national and short-term interests."
"Mr President, the European Parliament will summarise this debate on Helsinki in a resolution."
"As always, it will be a compromise resolution."
"There is nothing wrong with that, it is the nature of the beast."
"But, in this case, I fear that the willingness of the joint authors of this resolution to reach a compromise has gone too far."
"I am not referring so much to what is said, although I do have, to a greater or lesser extent, some difficulty with that, such as on the subject of Turkey."
"My criticism applies mainly to what is not said in the resolution."
"We set too much store by the principle of hope and too little on hard facts as far as enlargement is concerned."
"The Commission refers again and again in its status reports on the level of adaptation to the acquis communautaire to the fact that candidate countries, and this includes both the first wave and the second wave, are very slow in transposing and adapting to the acquis in numerous areas, such as social affairs, the environment and energy, as well as in human rights and living democracy."
"That is not enough."
"We should not be content to hope that a death sentence in Turkey will perhaps not be carried through."
"We should not be content to hope that sometime, somewhere, what are clearly unsafe nuclear power stations will perhaps be closed."
"We should not pretend that the extremely long transition periods which, in the 1980s, did not cause any real problems, may not cause any problems to the internal market."
"Do we really want to accept transition periods of fifteen years or more for basic freedoms in the movement of people and in the service sector and still keep our borders open?"
"We are in favour of enlargement; it is the answer to the question of the future of Europe, which is precisely why we must speak a clear language, even in compromise resolutions."
"Mr President, it is my privilege to speak again in a debate with Mrs Halonen."
"In fact, my first ever speech in this Chamber was back in July when I commended the Finnish Presidency on giving priority to information society and its work programme."
"Tonight, as we draw towards the close of that presidency, I want to commend the Finnish Presidency for working on this, but also to express some disappointment that it has not made more of the opportunities."
"Mrs Halonen only just managed to fit in a mention of information society - I think right in the last sentence of her speech - and yet, according to a paper that I received from the Commission last week, we are to have an e-Europe initiative presented at Helsinki, a paper entitled ""Information Society for All"" ."
"So far, we have not seen that."
"""All"" clearly still does not include Members of the European Parliament, so not many people know about it."
"Indeed it barely rated a mention in your speech, but I hope that the Council is going to spend some time on this vital topic."
"Could I also say on the broader topic of completing the internal market that, during the Finnish Presidency, we have had some very important strategy papers and they actually require a much higher priority than they are receiving in the Community at the moment."
"Indeed, the motion for a resolution I saw this morning contained no mention of any internal market or information society initiatives at all, despite the work that has been going on under your Presidency."
"I tabled an addendum in the name of my group this morning to include those items and I hope very much it will receive the support of this House."
"In conclusion, I also hope that the Finnish Presidency will remind Member governments at the Helsinki Council that creating a single market requires that cross-border takeovers and the restructuring of key industries must be allowed to proceed without political interference by Member governments."
"I am sure that Members of this House will know that there is a crucial takeover battle under way at the moment in the telecommunications sector."
"I have to say I am disappointed to see that some of the comments by senior politicians, and even Members of the Commission, suggest that the whole philosophy of an internal market has still to be fully accepted."
"Mr President, first I will admit that when we tried to meet both the demands of time and adhere to priorities we chose as the basis of talks certain of those issues which we knew would be the most important topics at Helsinki."
"Thus, I have touched less in my speech on certain other matters, attention to which has been drawn here quite justifiably."
"However, I can reassure and console the Members of the European Parliament and say that these issues have not been forgotten."
"Firstly, as regards the question of employment, we regard this as very important, and we have made preparations, as I said in my speech, to ensure that history' s first Summit conference on employment is a real success during Portugal' s presidential term."
"The special theme in matters of employment during the Finnish Presidency has been, inter alia, the status of the aged."
"There was an informal meeting of the Employment and Social Affairs Council on this subject, and we have also had a conference at ministerial level specifically on the topic of equality."
"In addition, we have raised the issue of the information society in the area of employment."
"A Council resolution was adopted on 29 November regarding employment in the information society and the social dimension."
"I will give my replies in a slightly different order from the speakers, but as Mr Harbour seems to be here still, I will say to him too that the Commission is presenting its extensive information society initiative to the European Council in Helsinki."
"The document will only be published on December 8."
"The issue is to be debated properly at the special Summit meeting in Portugal."
"The main focus of information society matters at Helsinki will be the consultation between the information society and competitiveness."
"This is an angle that has achieved prominence during the Finnish Presidency and will probably now be discussed in connection with issues to do with the economy, employment and competitiveness."
"Thus, there is also an intention in the conclusions to speed up the development of a regulated environment for electronic commerce."
"During the Finnish presidential term we have made progress in major projects for regulation, but the finishing touches will be undertaken during the next presidential term."
"So the results are somewhat better, or I might even venture to say, substantially better than was perhaps evident from my speech."
"Then I would like to answer one separate question, which is linked to the subject of enlargement."
"With regard to the question of the Roma people, which was raised here, I would like to say for my own part that I think it is right to focus attention on human rights, both generally and, in particular, regarding the rights of minorities, both in the European Union, but especially in those countries seeking membership."
"We have had experience of applicant countries during the Finnish presidential term, particularly with regard to the poor treatment of the Roma people, to the extent that large numbers of them have left those countries to apply for asylum."
"There are already nearly one thousand of them in Finland, if memory serves."
"The country to hold the presidency has not wished to draw the conclusion that the cause of this might only be found in Slovakia, Romania or in some other individual country."
"This is a common problem, and, for that reason, we intend to raise the issue, not in connection with enlargement, but as a general part of the Summit conference agenda, that Member States and applicant countries must improve the implementation of the rights of minorities."
"The country to hold the presidency is also offering to cooperate in this regard."
"Then I will turn to what are actually the main issues."
"Firstly, I will say in all honesty, regarding the Intergovernmental Conference, that we are unanimous on the issues omitted from the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Many of us here have tried to suggest that it would take just a little effort to try and solve these problems."
"Members of Parliament, they were not omitted from the Treaty of Amsterdam because they would have been minor issues."
"They were left out because they were very difficult questions and they have not got any easier in the meantime."
"However, a clear definition of the task will give us the chance now to succeed, as will the pressure to ensure the matter is put right."
"In addition, I clearly listed for you those issues that are closely connected with these subject areas, and that can possibly be added to the agenda."
"The third group is those issues that one or more Member States have raised."
"I venture to say that, although Finland is still a young Member State, I am at present one of the oldest foreign ministers in terms of years in office."
"There are only a couple of us ministers left who were at the previous Intergovernmental Conference."
"At that IGC we gained the support of 12, 13 or 14 Member States in quite a number of areas."
"But we did not receive support from the full 15, which would have been required for example for these majority decisions."
"In this connection, I am not at all sceptical, but I am realistic with regard to the fact that, if we want to get certain issues through quickly, we have to concentrate on those that are to some extent ready."
"Then there is this other process, whereby the big, longer-term plans are addressed."
"We can make progress just as soon as we are unanimous on them, but they are not vital with regard to enlargement."
"Regarding the participation of the European Parliament, I still cannot say what the solution will be at the Helsinki Summit, but I have said it already once before, and I will say so again, that our experience of their involvement on the previous occasion was a positive one."
"This is therefore the position of the country to hold the presidency."
"With regard to enlargement, that will be the topic of debate in the last General Affairs Council to be held on 6 December."
"At this Council meeting I shall try to put together those elements concerning Turkey that at least will enable us to believe we can make progress."
"I have had on-going discussions on this matter with my colleagues."
"I am not quite sure whether we will yet be able to achieve unanimity on the subject at the General Affairs Council."
"Should there be sufficient unanimity to make a joint decision, the country to hold the presidency can still use the days it has left before the Helsinki Summit to put the finishing touches to the issue."
"Our common desire seems to be that the issue should be solved somehow through consensus before the Helsinki Summit and, as the representatives of the country to hold the presidency, we will work hard to achieve a positive solution."
"I am grateful for all the comments made regarding the speed of enlargement, the Copenhagen criteria and everything else."
"Most of them reflected our opinion very closely when we were preparing the paperwork in the Council of Ministers."
"There were fewer remarks about foreign and security policy, but I would like to perhaps comment on one point."
"I have not mentioned the northern dimension issue at all this time."
"A meeting at ministerial level was held in Helsinki on the issue of the northern dimension, as we promised. Attendance was poor on the part of the foreign ministers of the other EU Member States - I was the only one there - but certain other ministers were present as well as all those ministers who are involved in the issue of the northern dimension."
"The response was very encouraging."
"The Commission promised to move things one step further and make an action plan, and thus we achieved what was perceived as the goal relating to the Portuguese presidential term."
"I agree with those who have spoken here that, if we increase stability, that, in its own way, increases security in Europe."
"With regard once more to enlargement, we have endeavoured to remind the applicant countries, just as has been said here, that we are not accepting new governments as members: we are accepting new countries."
"It is very important to say to the governments of applicant countries that they must also involve the opposition and the whole population in their plans, just as has been asked of them."
"I have said that the European Union cannot just accept young, well educated males living in cities, but we are taking everyone, including the elderly, those who live in rural areas, the less well-educated and women."
"The plans must thus also take account of that."
"Hopefully, we shall also be able to speak with them about social cohesion, nuclear safety and security, as well as many other things."
"I have tried to convince the applicant countries of these matters by saying that although not all these points will be dealt with at the negotiations, it might just be that they will attract so much attention in the parliaments of Member States that the applicant countries would be assured of swift acceptance if they began to attend to these matters right away, matters that will, in any case, be very important when they eventually become members."
"A final word about the IGC: if we acquired a legal character for the European Union at the next IGC many issues would be resolved."
"A legal personality, which is a matter that has been raised here in many speeches, was one of the questions that the majority supported but, where, unfortunately, consensus was not forthcoming. This was just another example of that problem."
"Mr President, I have a specific question for the President-in-Office of the Council. What is her opinion on the full participation of the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"This is an important question as it is contained in the report approved by this House and is vital to us."
"I would be grateful if she could answer this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this Chamber I have heard some pessimistic words regarding the forthcoming Summit."
"I do not agree at all. It is an extraordinarily important Summit that we - Parliament, Commission and Council Presidency - have prepared very carefully and vigorously, and the challenge of enlargement is an historic challenge of decisive importance."
"At Helsinki, enlargement will take root, get going and completely change Europe' s appearance."
"I agree with what many of you have said, that we must proceed towards enlargement with gusto and energy, a process which will look at each country' s case closely but seek to prevent them losing faith in us."
"Our programme for enlargement is therefore not at all minimalist."
