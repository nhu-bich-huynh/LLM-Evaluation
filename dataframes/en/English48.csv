"I also share your view that the ACP states will be persuaded to agree to this sort of proposal, which we hope will improve efficiency, only if we can provide sufficient guarantees that it is not just an excuse to reduce the resources available for development aid."
"How can we provide that kind of guarantee?"
"The Commission has specifically addressed this issue in its communication, stating that the current figure should set the minimum for the future."
"How could this be guaranteed within the budget?"
"It could be done by including details of the financial envelope in the legal basis for a multiannual programme. The Commission is not suggesting that a new heading should be included in the financial perspective."
"Instead we feel it would be beneficial if it were made clear within the structures of the financial perspective that different instruments are available for foreign policy and also for development aid. At the same time, by guaranteeing the financial envelope in the legal basis, we would ring-fence the funding, making it impossible for the synergy gains to trigger a reduction in the resources available."
"In the communication published today, the Commission has even proposed that the future evolution of EDF aid should be determined by general economic developments."
"This amounts to a positive statement, one that must also be viewed in the context of the commitments made at Monterey."
"That part of development aid which is financed from the budget, or will be in future, is obviously just a small fraction of the promised 0.39% of annual GNP, but I think that fraction should be guaranteed. Of course I cannot predict now whether that figure will be increased as a result of the financial negotiations."
"That concludes the item."
"As the Council is not present we will suspend the sitting for a few minutes."
"–As the Council still cannot attend, I propose to amend the agenda slightly and the next item is the oral question (B5-0278/2003), by Klaus-Heiner Lehne and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on market regulations and competition rules for the liberal professions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Monti for responding at such short notice."
"This has the advantage of allowing us to deal with this oral question under a slightly more ‘prominent’ section of the agenda rather than in discussions in the small hours."
"I am grateful that things have turned out this way."
"In fact, this oral question relates to a very important matter, namely the fact that over many centuries the Member States of the European Union have developed liberal professions, which are expected to fulfil certain specific roles. For example, lawyers are required to administer justice, and a notary’s duties include the drawing up of public instruments, while some professions have to obey very specific professional rules, as is the case with medical practitioners, pharmacists and many other liberal professions, where comparable rules and special structures exist."
"Let me say that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have been somewhat concerned by certain developments in Commission policy on the liberal professions over the years."
"I am thinking of the debate, for example, that we held some years back on the money-laundering Directive."
"We always have the impression that the Commission includes those who would like to apply to the liberal professions all those rules that hold for, say, supermarkets."
"That will not work, though, precisely because the professional structures all have their own particularities and these professions also have special public duties."
"They therefore require different treatment to normal market players who either buy or sell a given product on the market."
"In view of recent developments – one being the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies, which came out some months ago – we would like to know how the Commission plans to address this issue in future."
"We have actually heard that the Commission intends to undertake a broad consultation of all the sectors involved in the question, and we would naturally also be interested to hear what steps the Commission plans to take after the consultation exercise."
"The questions we have tabled focus on this aspect, and I think it would be very helpful if Commissioner Monti could also take a clear position on this subject today in his answers to this oral question."
"This could put an end to a lot of the uncertainty among the liberal professions and provide clarity."
"In our discussions on the agenda, Commissioner, we have already agreed that, in the next Strasbourg part-session, we also want Parliament to do what we did a few years ago, and approve a resolution to this effect."
"That should then give you some kind of yardstick for judging the views of this House on the very sensitive question of the liberal professions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission fully recognises the role that the liberal professions can play in making the European Union’s economy more competitive, thus helping to achieve the objectives set by the Lisbon European Council."
"The Commission certainly believes that the undoubted competence of the professions and their ability to establish relationships of mutual trust with their clients are vital factors in the success of members of the liberal professions, and engender a high level of satisfaction amongst their clients in Europe."
"It is with this in mind that the Commission has adopted a number of initiatives designed, as has already been mentioned, to ensure that the general interest is fully protected and, in particular, to guarantee a high level of independence and of professional ethics in this sector."
"The recent Wouters judgment of 19 February 2002 and the issue of safeguarding customers’ rights are also relevant here."
"In March 2003, we initiated an evaluation process with a view to forming an overall picture of regulation of the liberal professions and its effects across the countries of the European Union."
"This exercise takes two aspects into account: firstly, precisely because the liberal professions have a key impact on the competitiveness of other sectors, it is important to consider the economic consequences that regulation may have on production and on efficiency, price levels and employment; secondly, as the authors of the question have implied, it is vital to take into account non-economic aspects and accordingly to accurately assess the justification for various types of regulation."
"If the result is that some of this regulation goes beyond what can be objectively justified in order to guarantee high-quality services, on the one hand, and to protect consumer interests, on the other hand, the Commission, and also, I am sure, the members of the liberal professions themselves, will have to do everything in their power to ensure that these forms of regulation are reviewed."
"We are in the process of analysing the contribution of the liberal professions and of consumers to this assessment exercise."
"Mr Lehne, on 28 October 2003, a hearing of interested parties will be held – the hearing that you, yourself, referred to – and we trust that, on that occasion, we will be able to pull together a wide range of views from all quarters."
"Of course, if any Members of the European Parliament wish to take part, they will be more than welcome."
"I am sure that the debates will be of a high quality, and that they will enable us to gain a better understanding of how the professions operate."
"Your opinions, if you wish to participate, will certainly add to the quality of the debate."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like to remind the House that, in response to a proposal from my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, the Commission, on 7 March 2002, adopted a proposal for a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, the main aim of which, in view of the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, is to consolidate the 15 existing directives in this area and to increase the mobility of skills."
"This proposal is currently before this House at first reading."
"Without addressing the issue of professional qualifications, which remains an area in which the Member States have primary competence, the proposal aims to facilitate the provision of services to clients in any other Member State by members of the liberal professions with a qualification from a given Member State."
"At the same time, the Commission is exploring - in a wider context and in line with the strategy for the internal market in financial services - a coherent approach to overcoming the persisting obstacles to the provision of cross-border services, with the exception of those related merely to recognition of professional qualifications."
"Of course, if the Commission were to bring forward a new proposal in this area which also covered cross-border services provided by members of the liberal professions, it would take due account of the general interest objectives at stake and, especially, of the particular importance of independence and of professional ethics for these professions."
"By way of conclusion, while reiterating its commitment to respecting the regulation and the restrictive self-regulation that apply to the liberal professions, and which can be justified on grounds of general interest, the Commission believes that it has a duty to increase its endeavours to create a level playing field for qualified professionals, so as to increase cross-border mobility and promote healthy competition, in the interests of both the professions themselves and consumers."
"If I may use your own expression, Mr Lehne, we are all aware that supermarket rules are neither appropriate nor sufficient here."
"This is a very special sector which we do, however, consider could benefit from a critical review of its existing regulatory framework."
"Mr President, the relationship between the free market and the liberal professions is not a straightforward one, as Commissioner Monti has made clear."
"As you know, Mr Lehne, Mr Zappalà and other Members have been working in my committee for over a year on a directive on professional qualifications, and we are, therefore, very familiar with the specific, exceptional nature of the liberal professions."
"Members of the liberal professions offer an independent service based on an extremely high level of knowledge on which it is difficult to place a value."
"For this reason, professional activities are regulated by an ethical code covering relationships between professionals, between professionals and their clients, and between professionals and society as a whole."
"The behaviour of professionals is governed by an ethical framework covering their precise duties and the requirements of the service determined by professionals themselves, and this ethical framework therefore represents the first step towards regulation in terms of interpretation and application."
"A sociologist from the United States, Fredson, demonstrates in his work that the system of the professions corresponds to the work ethic, which has to strike a fair balance – and I agree with Commissioner Monti on this – between profit and the implementation of rules, which are the hallmarks of the market and of bureaucracy."
"This, in itself, is exceptional."
"Members of the liberal professions need to be granted a special status in order to maintain this delicate and difficult balance, not just in their own interest but also in the interest of society as a whole."
"Furthermore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 5, freedom to choose an occupation, stipulates that everyone has the right to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation, and freedom to choose an occupation is different from free enterprise."
"As stated in the Treaty, Commissioner Monti, the general interest mission of the liberal professions may also justify certain limits to the rules of competition."
"For this reason, legislation and the ethical regulatory framework may provide for exemptions from competition law in specific cases: in relation to professional fees, which may be mandatory, being set by the state; as regards an integrated approach to exercising the profession; in relation to advertising, where ethical codes may rule out the possibility of professionals passing judgment on each other; as regards membership of social insurance institutions; as regards mandatory membership of pension funds, which is accepted; and as regards exclusive rights for certain regulated professions."
"When all is said and done, Mr President, the rules that are necessary for each specific profession to ensure that profession's impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility for funds are not considered to be constraints on competition."
"The activities of the liberal professions should, therefore, ensure that professionals and the services that they provide help to offer positive solutions to the challenges that we face, thus protecting the general interest of society at large."
"The standards drawn up by professional associations under their own responsibility, with a view to safeguarding the quality of service provided, guarantee that such rules are observed in accordance with the conventions of professionalism and professional ethics."
"I accordingly believe – and this reflects Commissioner Monti's statement – that, in this way, and solely by virtue of the delicate balance that we have to strike between profit and ethics, a fair relationship can be established between the free market, competition, regulation and ethics in general."
"Mr President, the previous speakers have highlighted the special characteristics of the liberal professions and the need for differentiated legislation."
"Well, as Commissioner Monti has stressed, this differentiated legislation must be produced within a free market, in which clients normally have the possibility of choosing their professionals and furthermore can expect certain standards of behaviour."
"We should prevent one danger: that of maintaining professional organisations in the field of the liberal professions as a kind of medieval body, which it is very difficult to join, and above all that this type of professional organisation should prevent the free movement of people within the European Union."
"In other words, the two objectives, that of free access for clients or users to the liberal professions in any country of the Union, furthermore with the right to a system of a general nature, and also the right of access for professionals of one country to another country of the European Union, must be guaranteed."
"And within this context, the specific regulations for the liberal professions should be aimed, firstly, at guaranteeing discipline within those professions."
"In many cases, this is not the case."
"And it would be rather unfortunate for the Commission to imagine that the functioning of the professions is guaranteed by the professional organisations, if we then discovered that, in many cases, the ethical standards of the professions in question are not truly regulated within that profession."
"And many of us are aware of examples in all the liberal professions."
"I therefore believe that the Commissioner has made a very balanced analysis and furthermore I must congratulate him on his initiative to hold a hearing with the participation of people from the different sectors, but I hope that they are not just members of the professions, but also representatives of various sectors – industrial sectors, users, consumers – so that all aspects may be taken into account."
"Ultimately, I believe that a new regulation will be required, a rather specialised regulation, for the liberal professions, but that regulation must not run counter to the general rules of the European Union."
"As Commissioner Monti has said, we are not talking about a supermarket one cannot go into a supermarket to buy the services of a doctor but, within a market context, clients also have the right to benefit from the possibility, for example, of competition within a sector in which there are more professionals than there is demand for them."
"The supply and demand mechanism can also act as a selection factor, in that clients will normally go to those liberal professionals who offer them the best conditions, including prices."
"But if we establish an excessively closed regulation, if the conditions for access for clients are too strict, the clients will find themselves trapped as a result of the existence of these organisations and the prices they set, and they will not even have the opportunity to take action against them."
"I therefore believe that the Commissioner has dealt with the problem very well: we must seek a balance so that the special requirements of these professions for which we all want very high ethical standards, for which the main responsibility falls to the liberal professionals themselves by means of their organisations do not prejudice the client, the consumer or the user."
"The client must have the right of access to legal rules and judicial and administrative bodies, with the aim of guarantee that services are protected as far as possible and that, within the context of the requirements indicated by Mr Gargani and Mr Lehne, we can guarantee free competition, both within each of the countries of the Union and across the Union's borders."
"Mr President, Commissioner, every time anyone calls for liberalisation and talks about the need to pursue such liberalisation, their opponents raise the issue of specificity."
"When the liberalisation of a sector that provides a public service is discussed, people say that the sector in question is of a specific nature which needs to be taken into account and which means that the market rules applying to other economic and industrial sectors cannot be applied to this particular sector."
"The same goes for the liberal professions: all the professions have their own specific characteristics."
"But the hallmark of the liberal professions in Europe, and, particularly, in some countries such as Italy, is that they are the least liberalised of all."
"You see, Commissioner, when people say that there is a need to strike a balance, I am quite happy to agree, as long as we recognise that, at present, there is no balance at all, that today, in Europe, the so-called liberal professions are in actual fact based on closed professional associations that exercise a collective monopoly defending profit and creating obstacles for young people wanting to enter those professions."
"By way of example, let me mention the journalists' association."
"Very recently, a well known French journalist with a wealth of professional experience came to Italy when his publishing house bought several Italian newspapers, and he was appointed editor of one of those newspapers."
"Italy's journalists' association was up in arms, and made sure that this person, a Frenchman, was unable to do the same job in Italy."
"The liberalisation of professional services, as demanded by Italy's antitrust authority, is needed to help make many of Europe's industrial sectors more competitive – the sectors which are most dependent on the need to have a skills base and to be competitive on international markets."
"I welcome the October hearing, as long as, and let me repeat this, it is clear that balance can only be achieved in Europe today if we succeed in weakening the closed shop and monopolistic stranglehold that the professional associations represent."
"– Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, this debate reminds me a little of the debate we held on so-called services of general interest and competition law."
"Although the liberal professions are clearly not a supermarket – and although a supermarket as a market is not a service of general interest in this sense – the two do have some things in common."
"In the case of services of general interest, we agreed that competition law, the subsidy rules, and the internal market, meant that there was room for exceptions, to which subsidiarity would apply on the grounds that they can be shown to possess features from and be defined in terms of different identities and cultures."
"I think that the basic principle of subsidiarity – looking at different cultures and identities and the historical background of a given situation – can be applied here too."
"As supporters of competition law, and not just of Commissioner Monti, we also, though, have to remain consistent."
"I therefore feel that the application of EU competition rules to the liberal professions is reasonable and should be supported, provided that the particularities of this sector of the market are taken into account."
"I am therefore very pleased to see that the Commission is not questioning the existence of professional organisations."
"This, though, brings us to the heart of the matter."
"Liberal professions – lawyers, notaries, engineers, architects, doctors and auditors – are very specific in character and have undergone very specific historical development."
"They require high levels of qualification and a special relationship of trust with clients."
"However, they are also distinguished by the fact that the consumer does not have access to the same information as the service providers themselves."
"These characteristics have to be borne in mind."
"I therefore think that the Commission cannot be allowed to make the mistake of interpreting professional codes of conduct as a barrier to the freedom of movement of services."
"I do however entirely agree with the Commission that self-regulation cannot be used as a shield against the market and should not put consumers at a disadvantage."
"Nevertheless, we must not oversimplify matters."
"The primary aim of such self-regulation is to guarantee service quality by means of professional ethical standards and to prevent conflicts of interest and misleading advertising."
"It is in order to guarantee service quality that professional groups take responsibility for drawing up codes of conduct, and these lay down certain standards to ensure that professionals adhere to the rules and guarantee professional ethics."
"I see professional codes of conduct as essential for guaranteeing the impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility of the members of each professional body and for protecting consumers."
"Parliament and my group support the liberal professions because of their high ethical standards, the security they provide for consumers, their competence, impartiality and integrity, and we would ask that this special status be adequately taken into account when considering competition law so as to create security for all."
"Mr President, there are two things I must say by way of introduction."
"Firstly, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's report on the proposal for a directive referred to by Commissioner Monti."
"Secondly, a great deal of alarm has been caused in Europe, and particularly in my own country, by the Commissioner's various initiatives in terms of a series of research studies, of statistical data on charging structures and behavioural methodologies."
"Let us talk about the professions then."
"I believe that we all need to consider just what the word ‘profession’ means and its impact on the public."
"Generally speaking, professionals – of which there are several million in Europe – have daily contact with almost everyone in the world."
"In some ways, they safeguard safety, health and freedom."
"There is a great deal of confusion in general between different types of professionals: intellectual professionals are quite a different kettle of fish from professionals in general."
"As regards competition – and I am afraid that I do not have time to go into the detail I would like in some areas – competition in general means arguing about a price."
"When it comes to issues like safety, freedom and health, however, professional services mean having qualifications and levels of education that are certainly out of the ordinary and, in any case, not within everyone's grasp."
"Certainly, when we talk about competition we cannot talk in terms of prices but we should talk in terms of quality."
"Quality is something altogether different, because it is quality that ensures health, freedom and safety."
"This does not mean, as I see it, that we can disregard the question of competition, but we simply need to consider what kind of competition we are talking about."
"For example, there is absolutely no way that you can compare two different items of handcraft with two different operations by thoracic surgeons."
"By way of conclusion, Mr President, I do not believe that one should make sweeping generalisations."
"Professional associations are by no means simply closed shops; they have a function as regards training and lifelong learning, which provides consumers with certainty."
"Poor, badly functioning legislation that often forces professional associations to act in undesirable ways should not be used as an excuse to abolish the associations themselves."
". Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for this debate, in which I feel a number of very valuable points have been made."
"All the speakers have pointed out, with different emphases, that the liberal professions are well-rooted in history – Mr Gargani spoke eloquently on this subject – and that we need to strike a balance between sets of contrasting concepts: self-regulation and public regulation; the market and non-market considerations; specificity and, notwithstanding, endeavours to generate greater mobility in Europe."
"It has been pointed out, as I said, that we need a balance: this may be where the emphases differ, for some – like Mr Medina Ortega and, to an even greater extent, Mr Della Vedova – believe that the current balance may not be a proper balance and that a great deal more progress needs to be made; others, who are more cautious, call for the specific nature of the liberal professions to be given greater consideration and, therefore, for the current balances to be seen as not so unsatisfactory."
"Another thing which appears to have emerged from the debate is that we need to know more, we need to increase our knowledge."
"This was precisely the reason for the evaluation exercise, based on the study commissioned by the Commission from the Institute of Higher Studies in Vienna, which I believe adds to our knowledge in that it looks at the current systems in the 15 Member States for five different categories of liberal professions and attempts to make comparisons."
"On this basis, indeed, we believe that the hearing, the Conference of 28 October, in which, as has been pointed out by Mr Medina Ortega, in particular, representatives of clients as well as representatives of the professions will take part, may be useful."
"In this regard, we must not forget that the clients of the professions are made up of both private individuals and companies: the impact of quality, of course, of standards of conduct and also of prices is therefore significant in terms of the real level of income, the citizens’ standard of living and the production costs of companies."
"The situations in the Member States differ, as has emerged from this study."
"In this regard, Mr Karas, I feel that the comparison you made between this issue of the liberal professions and the matter of services of general economic interest – , to put it more succinctly–is extremely interesting."
"Indeed, in both cases, we have to recognise demands that go beyond purely market considerations and, in both cases, I believe there is room, with due regard for those demands, for attempting to increase competition and efficiency."
"I feel that the Commission is taking a very balanced approach to this task."
"I note, as you did, Mr Zappalà, that some alarm has arisen in a number of Member States."
"I would like, if I may, to take this opportunity to stress that such alarm is unfounded, for two reasons: firstly because – to use your expression – nobody is trying to lump everyone together; on the contrary, the study on which our evaluation exercise is based distinguishes, as I said, between five professional categories and 15 Member States, precisely in order to avoid lumping everyone together under the same umbrella."
"In a preliminary press debate in a number of Member States, the European Commission was said to be intending to opt for uncontrolled liberalisation."
"Irrespective of the fact that the Commission has a tradition of a certain prudence in its initiatives, we believe that, particularly in this field, it would be rather silly to start from the assumption that there is nothing that needs changing, although none of us sees uncontrolled liberalisation as an option."
"That concludes the debate.(1)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels on 16 and 17 October 2003."
"I should like to say to Mr Antonione that we appreciate the enormous pressures that he has been operating under today."
"When we are given ambitious schedules, they are sometimes very difficult to keep to, even with the best will and the highest levels of flexibility."
"I would, however, make a general appeal to Mr Antonione and I would ask him to pass this appeal on to his colleagues to give the appropriate priority to the interinstitutional relationship with this House."
"I would ask that we use our best endeavours to avoid repetitions of what is an unfortunate but in the case of this afternoon unavoidable problem."
". Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, before I start, I really do want to apologise for the delay: I was detained by duties I had to carry out on behalf of the Italian Presidency, as a result of which I arrived later than the time scheduled for the debate on the agenda."
"I would also like to thank you, Mr President, and the other Members of Parliament, and the Commission too, for changing the order of business and thus giving me the chance to speak now."
"I can assure you, Mr President, that I will do everything in my power to avoid this happening again."
"We will certainly give absolute priority to the relationship between the institutions, as it is right to do."
"I am grateful to the European Parliament for this opportunity to present to the House the main topics on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, which will take place here in Brussels on 16 and 17 October."
"On the morning of 16 October, before the European Council opens, the Intergovernmental Conference will hold its second meeting, at the level of Heads of State or Government, assisted by their Foreign Ministers."
"The proceedings of the European Council itself will start at 4 p.m. with the customary meeting between the Heads of State or Government and the President of the European Parliament."
"Before I present to you the items on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, I would like to say a few words about the special summit of Heads of State or Government which, as you know, took place in Rome earlier this month to mark the official opening of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have thus now embarked on the second leg of the constitutional process that began with the work of the Convention and the draft Constitutional Treaty which it drew up."
"President Cox, let me begin by mentioning your own attendance at the inaugural session, something to which, as you well know, the Italian Presidency attached particular importance."
"Your fellow Members, Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez de Vigo, went on to attend the first ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was held in the afternoon of the same day."
"The Rome summit basically confirmed our shared understanding of the historic nature of this stage in the process of European integration and the need to provide the enlarged Union with cohesive, mutually agreed constitutional foundations; that, we are convinced, is essential if we are to strengthen Europe's internal cohesion and increase the credibility and authority of its international role."
"The atmosphere of the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was attended by the President and Vice-Presidents of the Commission and, as I mentioned earlier, the President of the European Parliament, in addition to the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, the acceding States and the candidate countries, was constructive."
"There was broad consensus on the fact that the Member States were collectively accountable to Europe's public opinion for ensuring the success of the IGC in the interests of the enlarged Union and of its Member States."
"The very fact that the Heads of State or Government adopted the Rome Declaration without difficulty is clear confirmation that the adoption of a draft Constitutional Treaty is a shared goal and a vital step for Europe."
"There were, of course, persisting national differences on specific aspects of the draft Treaty, although the collective intention to adhere to the timeframes we established at Thessaloniki was confirmed."
"The first ministerial meeting of the IGC resulted in further clarification of the timetable, methodology and organisation of the work which the Italian Presidency intends to carry out in order to provide the Heads of State or Government with all the elements necessary for them to reach a comprehensive agreement at their meeting on 12 and 13 December 2003."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will focus primarily on reviving the economy and increasing competitiveness and on certain aspects of European asylum and immigration policy, in particular the issue of the joint management of the Union's external borders and controlling migration flows."
"The General Affairs Council held an initial discussion on the draft annotated agenda at its meeting on 29 September 2003 and will return to the subject at its next meeting, on 13 October, on the basis of an updated version of the agenda, which will also reflect the conclusions of the meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs and Ecofin Councils earlier this month and the meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 9 October."
"As is customary at summits, the Brussels European Council will also deal with topical international issues."
"The agenda is still being finalised but I can tell you that, as things stand, the Summit will address the issue of the situation in the Middle East, following the recent, extremely disturbing developments, the situation in Iraq, with a view, not least, to the impending Donors’ Conference, and the situation in Iran, in the context of our endeavour to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"As I have already mentioned, the Italian Presidency intends discussions at the forthcoming European Council meeting to centre on the urgent need to revive the European economy."
"Let me say straight away, however, that the Italian Presidency does not intend there to be any overlap with the spring European Council."
"Indeed, in March 2004, as scheduled, we will have our yearly appointment to review the overall implementation of the Lisbon strategy on the basis of the Commission’s report and contributions from the various Council configurations."
"Nonetheless, the Italian Presidency does consider that the forthcoming mid-October European Council will afford a useful opportunity for an exchange of views and a policy debate on a highly topical and urgent issue which is a source of concern to us all and on which our opinions converge."
"In other words, we expect the October summit to provide scope for a debate on economic growth and revival and on the instruments for increasing competitiveness in an economic climate in which Europe's economy is still struggling to seize the opportunities for recovery which are visible in other parts of the world."
"We also expect the European Council conclusions to provide pointers and commitments to guide the work of the various Council configurations in the months ahead."
"Indeed, we are convinced of the need to continue with sound macroeconomic policies while, at the same time, speeding up the necessary structural reforms, promoting investment in infrastructure and human capital and adopting economic policies oriented towards growth, job creation and genuine integration of the new Member States into the great single market."
"The European Council should lay the foundations for a programme supporting growth based on significantly increased investment in major infrastructure networks and in research and development projects, with more substantial private-sector input."
"We welcome the recent Commission communication and the Ecofin Council decisions on the European Initiative for Growth."
"We call upon the European Council to give the economy a further decisive boost."
"Developing the trans-European transport network projects and ensuring that they actually get under way is a matter of particular urgency, not only as a response to enlargement and in the interests of integration between the old and the new Member States, but also in order to remove the obstacles and bottlenecks currently distorting the operation of the internal market."
"Against this backdrop, the forthcoming European Council is to give its assessment of the Commission's proposed new plan for priority TEN projects and should be able to give a clear, powerful recommendation for the proposals to be swiftly approved."
"Indeed, we believe that it is essential to set a reliable timetable for implementing the projects in order to stimulate investment-based economic growth and to boost market expectations and business confidence."
"Italy's recent electricity black-out has made us all more aware of the pressing need to complete the creation of a truly integrated European energy market and to strengthen the security of energy supplies, bearing in mind the Member States' heavy dependence on imported energy as well."
"The European Council will thus need to provide guidance, not least, on better integrating European networks and developing new forms of energy cooperation with third countries, in particular with the Mediterranean partners, with a view to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Energy Ministers in Rome in early December."
"Enhancing competitiveness remains the key to achieving the objectives of growth and job creation."
"The Italian Presidency understands the need to use the right instruments, both at European and at national level, for organising a genuinely open, competitive market based on knowledge, industrial development and a steadily expanding and diversifying services sector."
"Investment in research, advanced technologies and human capital is vital if we are to achieve our growth objectives."
"The European Council will be called upon to provide the necessary impetus, stimulating Member States to adopt coordinated measures to ensure tangible progress towards the target investment of 3% of GDP in research and urging industry and all parties concerned to contribute to creating European technological platforms in key competitive sectors of the Union's economy."
"Lastly, the European Council will also address the social dimension in its work and the vital role played by social protection systems in enhancing the competitiveness of Europe's economies."
"However, social protection systems across Europe are now having to respond to the challenge of an ageing population, so, while it will be necessary, on the one hand, to ensure that the social dimension is strengthened and fully integrated into the Union's economic and employment policies, on the other, it is just as essential to devise policies for reforming the employment market and to address the issue of Europe's steadily ageing population by reforming benefit and pension systems to make them financially sustainable while, at the same time, maintaining a high level of social protection."
"In a nutshell, then, at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council, the Presidency will confirm that the timing of the launch of the growth initiative is intended to give a strong signal of sound economic governance and renewed confidence in Europe's economic potential."
"Given current economic pressures, that signal now needs to ring out loud and clear if we are to sustain the gathering pace of structural reform under the Lisbon agenda."
"Before I close, I would add that – as I started out by saying – the Presidency considers that the European Council may also note some recent developments in respect of the Thessaloniki European Council guidelines on asylum and immigration policies and, more importantly, that it may pave the way for new joint initiatives at European level."
"The forthcoming European summit will, therefore, be called upon to confirm that controlling migration flows is a top priority and to reaffirm the Union's commitment to promoting a balance between the proper management of legal immigration and renewed efforts to combat illegal immigration."
"We therefore expect the European Council to call on the Commission, the Council and all Member States to do everything in their power to facilitate and speed up the conclusion of readmission agreements, in particular with the countries of origin or transit of large migration flows while, at the same time, confirming the importance of effective Community action on repatriation, in order to give credibility to Europe's policy on combating illegal immigration."
"With the imminent enlargement of the Union and the need to make every effort to increase the security of Europe's citizens, the Heads of State or Government will, once again, need to stress that all Member States – old and new – have a common interest in seeing effective mechanisms put in place for the joint management of the Union's borders, particularly its sea borders."
"The importance of fully implementing the plan for the management of the Union's external borders should therefore be confirmed afresh and the Commission invited to submit at the earliest opportunity a proposal for setting up a border management agency."
"Lastly, the European Council will call on the Council to complete its work on the proposal for a directive on asylum as soon as possible and will welcome the study launched by the Commission on setting national quotas, with the present and future Member States being urged to cooperate fully with the Commission to that end."
". Mr President, Mr Antonione, ladies and gentlemen, on 16 and 17 October, the European Council is going to address the questions of strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice and reviving our economy."
"Today, I would like to focus on these two key areas."
"Immigration stopped being a purely national question some time ago."
"It was transformed dramatically into a European question as the ever-increasing flows of immigrants and the increase in related crime set the alarm bells ringing in all the Member States."
"The management of our borders must therefore become a shared task that we tackle together in the interests of us all."
"The impending enlargement will extend the Union’s external borders and the new Member States will become almost entirely responsible for them."
"Alone, the new countries are in no position to manage this onerous task, which involves not just policing but also – and perhaps above all – political and social planning."
"Our human social conscience tells us that unlawful trafficking in human beings and hopeful voyages undertaken under inhumane conditions cannot be tolerated. At the same time, we must address the question of migration flows resolutely and coordinate the management of our common borders."
"The Thessaloniki European Council showed the way, stressing the need to step up implementation of the Tampere programme, particularly with regard to a common European policy on asylum and migration."
"At the next Council, the Commission will fulfil the mandate assigned to it by the European Council by presenting a series of measures with a view to completing the common policy."
"As an initial move, the idea of setting up an agency for the management and operational coordination of border controls is currently being explored and the Council will be able to take a decision on this by the end of the year."
"The agency will not replace national border guards. Its tasks will involve organising horizontal operations such as risk analysis, training, research and the procurement of equipment to be loaned to Member States."
"A special study has been carried out on sea borders with a view to incorporating them in the overall organisation of the Union’s external borders."
"The Commission will also propose introducing biometric identification methods for visas and residence permits that will later be incorporated into the major computer systems, most notably the second generation of the Schengen Information System."
"We are also preparing initiatives aimed at making passports more secure."
"When tackling this extremely sensitive issue, however, we will always bear in mind that the need for security and controls must not jeopardise our citizens’ right to privacy."
"The most pressing issue is undoubtedly the question of migration flows."
"Legal immigrants are actually an economic, cultural and human resource that we must welcome and integrate into our societies as best we can, with due regard for their dignity."
"A pro-active policy on economic immigration and integration therefore needs to take account of the situation in the immigrants’ country of provenance, our economic and social needs and our effective capacity to integrate the new arrivals."
"It is also our duty to combat illegal immigration, however. In the coming months we will need to focus on two instruments: readmission agreements and return policies."
"As requested by the Council, the Commission has opened negotiations with third countries to establish readmission procedures for citizens who have entered the European Union unlawfully."
"Although great efforts have been made, these are difficult negotiations because the Commission has to persuade third countries not only to readmit their own citizens but also to allow citizens on their way back to other states to pass through those countries."
"Our experience shows that the negotiations will be successful only if they are conducted within a broader framework and we can bring to the table a number of incentives."
"For example, in the Authorised Destination Status agreement we concluded only last week with China, which includes a readmission clause, economic considerations played a significant role."
"Some might say that they should not have done, but that is the way things are."
"The other important point is the need to offer our partner countries guaranteed immigration quotas, preferably within the context of negotiations involving economic cooperation, development aid and access to markets."
"Indeed, it is essential that the Member States facilitate our negotiating position so that we can reach fair agreements that help to create the necessary climate of cooperation and trust with the partner countries."
"All the various stages of any return policy must be adequately financed."
"To ensure that operations are efficient and are conducted with full respect for the dignity of the persons concerned, in autumn the Commission will propose creating a special financial instrument to fund returns over the period from 2004 to 2006."
"On the basis of this experience, we will be in a position to include a genuine European Fund for Repatriation in the new Financial Perspective that will enter into force in 2007."
"Today, we find ourselves having to contend with migration flows in which it is difficult to distinguish between refugees in search of asylum and economic migrants: the two are very often confused."
"We must therefore offer protection to those in need while, at the same time, regulating access for the others in an organised manner."
"First and foremost, however, we need to strengthen the institution of asylum, which is an integral part of our humanitarian tradition but which seems to be coming under heavy fire from public opinion in many countries."
"To implement the Thessaloniki European Council’s conclusions by the end of the year, the Commission will complete the first phase of the development of the common asylum system agreed at Tampere by adopting the two directives not yet in place: one on procedures and one – a complex but important document – on the definition of refugee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn briefly to the other major subject that will be addressed by the Brussels Council: how to help revive Europe’s economy."
"Needless to say, the last two years have not produced encouraging signs from our economy."
"The current picture is of weak growth, little confidence on the part of households and businesses and low levels of investment."
"However, a few recent indicators suggest that the corner may about to be turned – let us hope so – and that the current slump may, at last, be in sight, barring tensions in international politics."
"The underlying economic conditions (the fundamentals) are good because the Member States have stuck to the rules and behaved in less divergent ways, particularly following the introduction of the euro, and thanks to an increased awareness of the need to implement the structural reforms agreed in Lisbon."
"We must therefore give our economy fresh impetus."
"To this end, last week, the Commission adopted the European Initiative for Growth, which will now be put before the Council for approval."
"The Initiative is, of course, based on the Lisbon strategy on investment in networks and knowledge."
"However, its objective is to mobilise additional public and, above all, new private fundsin the shorter term to finance European-scale infrastructure projects and boost research and innovation."
"The message to our citizens is, therefore, that we are laying the practical foundations for structural, long-term improvements to our competitiveness."
"A European transport and communications network is essential to better integrate our economies and to increase cohesion."
"By demonstrating our determination, we will send out a clear signal that the Union is, at last, able to take economic decisions that can no longer be put off."
"The new market opportunities guaranteed by the financial commitment of the Member States and the private sector will, in turn, encourage direct input from European businesses."
"The direct effects of the investments in the projects will be seen as soon as work is started on the construction sites, which, in a large number of cases, could be quite soon."
"The Initiative we are presenting to you today has benefited from experience gained from previous initiatives and attempts to resolve problems that have caused delays in the past."
"As part of the strategy, last week, the Commission adopted a package that includes 29 major trans-European network projects involving a total investment of some EUR 220 billion between now and 2020."
"This is the overall picture of what must be achieved if we are to provide the single market with an effective infrastructure to make our economy more competitive."
"However, it is clear that only certain projects will be ready for implementation in the near future."
"The Commission will give the European Council an indication of the timetable for completing the works listed to enable the Heads of State or Government to concentrate all their efforts and make the greatest possible contribution to boosting the economy in the short term."
"While the Initiative looks for greater private sector investment, there is clearly still a key role for public financing."
"This makes the balance and, above all, the quality of public expenditure absolutely crucial."
"We must direct investment towards growth. To increase leverage and thus speed up the completion of the works, we propose increasing the contribution from the Community budget from 10% to 30% for the cross-border aspects of the highest priority projects."
"This will make it possible to mobilise far greater private sector resources."
"We also need to give the European Investment Bank a greater role, however."
"To this end, the Initiative proposes to give it a greater role in easing the burden and sharing the financial risks."
"We will also urge the Member States to step up their investment in research, development and knowledge to encourage the development of physical and human capital."
"These are the only recipes for safeguarding sustainable employment in the long term."
"I cannot repeat enough – picking up on what Mr Antonione said about the inadequate level of research – that supremacy in international competition is to be achieved through innovation, centres of excellence and the development and transmission of information and knowledge."
"We also need to do more in terms of lifelong learning and training for our citizens."
"In addition to the great efforts they are making in the field of structural reform, the Member States will also, therefore, need to step up their work in these areas, taking advantage of Community resources such as the Sixth Framework Programme, the performance reserve and the mid-term review of the Structural Funds in 2004."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must link up the major European research centres, support their activities and make them attractive to academics and scientists throughout the world."
"There is nothing for it: we must take the decision to provide Europe with the best centres of excellence in the world, for, otherwise, our children will lose enthusiasm for research and innovation."
"We must concentrate on technical and scientific innovation and on ways of helping manufacturers turn innovation into new processes and products."
"These are the playing fields on which we will win or lose our future prosperity, our influence on the international stage and our capacity to defend Europe’s interests and uphold its values in the world."
"Therefore, we must find the political will to meet this challenge and press forward resolutely towards the goal which I know you, too, are striving to achieve."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is starting much later than planned, and I would like to apologise because as soon as I finish speaking I will leave to attend another important engagement. This is something I have never done before."
"I know we all have other commitments, and I was engaged to be elsewhere at 5 p.m. I hope that there will be no repetition of today’s delays."
"The summit of Heads of State or Government in the spring of 2002 did expressly set itself a very ambitious objective, namely to create the most competitive economy in the world."
"This claim always reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Soviet Union wanted to outdo the US."
"We know how that ended."
"Slightly more moderate language would make our present situation – namely the lack of progress – a little easier."
"At the same time, we have to ensure that Europe’s economy becomes more competitive."
"In order for that to happen, two key conditions must first be met."
"One is the reform of our social system, and the other is greater flexibility in labour markets."
"Happily, people are living longer, but this also presents a massive challenge to our social system."
"Our group feels very strongly that we have to introduce more independence and self-sufficiency into our social systems."
"We need to make the labour market more flexible, because if the labour market stays as it is, if we maintain the , people out of work will be hit particularly hard, and these are the very people we want to see return to work."
"Our group would therefore like to encourage governments which are undertaking a tough reform process to address this issue to keep going, in order to provide us with answers for the future that offer genuine, viable solutions for today’s younger generation."
"The best policy approach for jobs, companies, and particularly for medium-sized companies, is a moderate taxation policy."
"The less taxes companies have to pay, the more they will be willing to invest in Europe."
"Today, we know that it is because our current economic system is so bureaucratic and often has very high taxation, that our companies invest outside the European Union."
"We can therefore only encourage policies which offer the best for medium-sized companies, with maximum transparency in taxation, to show that investment within the European Union is worthwhile, rather than forcing companies, as is increasingly the case, to invest outside the European Union."
"My colleague Mr Karas, our economic policy coordinator, whom I see here, spoke, about Basel II a few weeks ago."
"We also have to ensure that Basel II does not make it harder for medium-sized companies to invest. Instead we need to conclude worldwide agreements and organise Basel II in such a way that it is possible for medium-sized companies to take out loans and pay them back under reasonable conditions."
"Then there is the question of European bureaucracy and the self-inflicted tangles of red tape."
"Here I am addressing the President of the Commission."
"We are eagerly awaiting the Commission proposals for chemicals legislation."
"But if this legislation on chemicals results in European companies again investing outside the European Union because of the thousands of regulations imposed upon them and leaving the European market, then it will lead to further job losses and consequently a less competitive Europe."
"We would therefore caution against tying the European economy up in more red tape through national or European legislation."
"Let me comment briefly on the question of the stability of the euro."
"There are some people who believe we now ought to go well beyond the 3% figure established under Maastricht for new borrowings."
"I can only advise against such a step."
"If we enter into new borrowings now, those loans will have to be repaid, and the money used to make the repayments will then not be available for investment."
"It is investment that creates jobs."
"For this reason the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats recognises the need to uphold the stability criteria, although obviously we do acknowledge the difficulties that national governments are facing."
"The President of the Commission and, I believe, the President-in-Office of the Council, have talked about how important it is to do something for education and research."
"We cannot continue to allow ever more young scientists to go to the United States and thus be lost to us."
"This represents a loss not only of human potential, but also of the future potential of Europe. The issue must therefore be addressed more directly."
"To close, I would like to make a couple of brief remarks about Europe’s borders and the protection of them."
"It is a very important topic, but I wonder whether it is necessary to create a new border management agency, as set out in the European Council paper."
"Can we not tackle the problems using existing structures? I am just airing the question now."
"Let me also encourage the Presidency not to limit discussions at the conference on the Mediterranean dialogue in December to the very important question of borders. Rather, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to also consider how we can help countries to help themselves, particularly those Mediterranean countries which are not members of the European Union, in order to prevent people climbing into boats in order to reach the borders of the European Union, resulting in the tragedies that we keep seeing in the Mediterranean."
"My last words are a request to the President-in-Office of the Council, and one I think he will follow up."
"I would like to encourage the President-in-Office to do his utmost to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference comes to agreement by the end of the year."
"Please do not allow every page of the Convention’s proposals to be completely renegotiated."
"Concentrate on the three or four key points."
"We will support you in your efforts to achieve a result, because we need a European constitution. A European constitution is the basis on which this European Union, which will soon comprise twenty-five Member States and 450 million people, will be able to make the decisions it needs to make, will be able to act, to be democratic, and to uphold parliamentary principles."
"So let me encourage you to concentrate your efforts during the presidency on the constitution."
"It is the top priority for these six months."
"Mr President, first of all, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the first part of your speech fulfils the commitment given by the Italian Presidency to inform Parliament of what has happened during each part-session."
"I would like to say that those of us, myself in particular, who asked that Parliament be adequately represented, appear to have been listened to and I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for this."
"With regard to the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference, I must say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and you will understand this given your professional experience – that you have touched our trigeminus, which is the most sensitive nerve in the body, as you are well aware."
"Why?"
"Because the first thing the Intergovernmental Conference has done has been to get rid of the legislative Council, with some resistance on the part of Germany and Portugal, and that is very serious."
"It is very serious because we are working on the basis of shared legislative powers and the first thing the Council does is to dismantle something which is essential in a democracy: legislating in the open, in public."
"It appears to be an appendix to the Council and I naturally support our two representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference who vigorously opposed that outrage."
"Furthermore, I would say that this is not only a problem you face with us: it is also a problem you face as regards the national parliaments, because the greatest insult is to the parliaments of the Member States."
"I would repeat my request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs invite all the members of the Convention from the national parliaments and present them with this problem: how can the legislative Council be dismantled in the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And having said that, please allow me to focus on my observations relating to the economic aspect."
"I will leave the task of dealing with the issue of borders to my colleague, Mrs Ana Terrón."
"My comments are based on one particular fact: stability is a public asset; nobody, neither people, families nor States can live beyond their means, and the policy of stability based on combating inflation is a policy in defence of the majority of society."
"Only property owners, and the bigger the better, can survive and even profit from inflation."
"Stability protects the most humble and the Stability Pact is an urgent objective, but there can be no stability without growth."
"At the moment the greatest danger to the European economy is not so much inflation but deflation and therefore, having lived through three years of mild recession, all the Member States must address a situation in which there are fewer resources, and they are therefore in a vicious cycle in which they have to increasingly get into debt or reduce investment costs and sometimes both things at the same time."
"It appears that Europe has chosen the latter route, which is the worst one."
"Since the end of the last decade public investments have fallen in the European Union by around 1% (in the United States this figure stands at 3%)."
"According to the Commission’s data, investment of 1% means supplementary growth of 0.6%."
"We must recognise that the European States have not taken advantage of the good years."
"They have not carried out a policy of the ant: they have carried out a policy of the cicada and have not reduced their debt, but it is equally true that the Member States will not recover the virtuous cycle of growth if they restrict themselves to survival or maintenance investments, and if they continue to cut off the citizens’ spending power."
"What we must do is carry out an intelligent reform of the pact in order not to be guilty of the accusation of stupidity which has been made."
"Yes, Mr President, I will use the same expression; you will know that it is the only one that does not require translation into any European language: stupidity."
"We must be more rigorous in periods of strong growth: for example, the obligation to have a balanced budget on the basis of 3% growth or more, the obligation to use anything that exceeds the 3% growth in order to decrease debt and to leave the States in the euro zone with more flexibility for investment spending during a recession phase."
"What does not make any sense is to maintain a single level which does not correspond to the Union’s economic reality."
"Specifically, at the moment Germany and France, with a debt of around 60% of their GDP, have greater room for manoeuvre than Italy or Belgium which exceed it, which exceed 100% by a long way."
"In other words, we must be flexible here as well."
"And if we were capable of attaching new conditions – something which should be debated at the European Council – to the Stability and Growth Pact, then the second part we have all referred to would come: this formula of returning to a great network of investments in trans-European networks also supplemented by investments in technology and research."
"This was said ten years ago at the European Council in Essen."
"With enlargement our EUR 400 billion are going to become the EUR 600 billion identified by the Van Miert group with a view to 2020."
"Well, nothing is being done."
"We are moving very slowly."
"An analysis is made and what can be done?"
"The President of the Commission has proposed – if I have understood correctly – that funding should increase from 10% to 30% of the projects."
"This is a step."
"What can the other be?"
"It may be a great European loan."
"Why not?"
"Our capacity for debt is intact, we have a euro zone in which 90% of transactions are carried out between the member countries."
"Why do we not dare to implement a relaunching policy, which no country can do individually, so that there may be results for the whole continent?"
"Our budget approximately represents a miserly 1% of Community GDP."
"The United States deficit for this financial year is equivalent to 6 European Union budgets."
"I do not propose that we go as far as the United States with the deficit spending, but we could at least make an effort."
"We have the means but we do not have the will."
"Mr President, as we approach the first European Council of the Italian presidency and assess the progress thus far, is the glass of prosecco that the presidency will offer next week half full or half empty?"
"On the evidence of the inaugural meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Rome I fear it is half empty."
"When the Member States convene again to discuss Europe's draft constitution, they should recall the shambolic Nice Summit and reflect on the costs of failure."
"Poland and Spain should be reminded that their intransigence over the reform of voting weights in Council is perilous politics as well as poor mathematics."
"If the Nice arrangements were satisfactory, the Council would not have established a Convention in the first place."
"The system of majority voting agreed at Nice is unwieldy and unfair."
"To its credit, the Convention threw out the unsteady compromises of Nice and proposed a voting system which is fairer and more transparent."
"Last time I checked, the representatives of the Spanish and Polish Governments had signed up to the Convention's outcome: now they must respect its work."
"On other issues too, the hard bargaining has been done."
"The consensus crafted by the Convention will not be improved on in Rome."
"Unpick the substance of the draft Treaty and the IGC will drag on into 2004 and descend into diplomatic farce."
"Then Rome really will be the eternal city."
"When it comes to economic reform and the Stability Pact, the bubbles in the prosecco have long evaporated."
"France has yet to convince us that it takes its responsibilities seriously."
"While we understand the reluctance of some governments to confront France, a Stability Pact without teeth is a paper dragon breathing tinsel flames."
"The eight governments which have worked hard to play by the rules - often at considerable political cost - have every right to be dismayed that their larger neighbours take fiscal laxity so lightly."
"The Italian presidency's drive to enhance Europe's competitiveness at the European Council is welcome."
"But we need to move beyond bold declarations."
"To achieve better and simpler legislation we need proper consultation and business impact assessments."
"A level playing field for company take-overs is still frustratingly far away and we have much work to do to agree a viable framework for an integrated market in investment services before the European elections."
"My group welcomes this week's decision by finance ministers to refocus the growth initiative away from road and rail projects and towards investment in innovation which will help to close Europe's research deficit."
"In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, there is more sparkle in the Council's agenda."
"The balance which the Liberal Group seeks to ensure between tackling illegal migration and providing for a system of managed legal migration seems to be essentially there."
"We will support the Commission in its efforts to create a Border Management Agency."
"Europe's new eastern border will be one of the longest in the world: it is crucial that we pool our expertise in policing it properly."
"Sadly, the external agenda of the Union leaves us no cause for celebration."
"The failure of Cancún must redouble our determination to secure reform of the WTO and trading arrangements which help the world's poorest countries."
"Europe must insist on a central role for the United Nations in return for the internationalisation of the situation in Iraq."
"And the tragic events of the past week in the Middle East confirm the need for Europe and America to remain engaged."
"My group condemns unreservedly the suicide bombings in Haifa, but calls on Israel to abide by international law and act proportionately in its response."
"A new Constitution, a credible Stability Pact, a revitalised economy, a secure and just Europe in a more stable world: these would be the flavours of a truly vintage year: ."
"I too must apologise to Council and Commission for having to leave before the end of this debate."
"The rescheduling of this debate has caused me this embarrassment."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the European Council will take place at a time when Germany, Italy and Portugal are going through a recession and when France is poised to follow them."
"In addition to these countries, the entire euro zone is experiencing an economic downturn and, in many ways, a downturn in social protection too."
"There is now such a wide gulf between the supposed benefits of the completion of the internal market and the introduction of the euro and the everyday realities of our fellow citizens that we are entitled to call for a genuine public and pluralist evaluation of the guidelines that have been followed and of the instruments with which the Union has implemented these guidelines."
"It goes without saying that the course of action I have recommended bears no relation at all to the anti-European demagoguery of some senior political leaders – starting with those of my own country, Mr Watson – who use such talk to cover themselves in the eyes of their electors."
"These leaders accuse Brussels in order to make people forget that their own Head of State personally negotiated the Treaties and signed the Stability Pact."
"They only complain about the harshness of the procedures in force when they themselves are faced with a powerful and entirely legitimate resistance movement made up of workers in their own countries."
"Above all, they do not call into question the very mindset of the stability pact and even less that of the Phare institution whose pact is ultimately just its bodyguard: the European Central Bank."
"Its mandate and its statutes make those of the Central Bank appear to be the most liberal and untouchable in the world."
"This is precisely why I believe the evaluation that I have just mentioned to be so necessary."
"It is true that when economies are so interdependent, there must be common rules and these must be observed."
"What rules, though, and to achieve what objectives?"
"This is the crux of the matter."
"What have we gained from this approach of attracting capital in rivalry with the United States, at the cost of a permanent and almost obsessive quest to bring wage costs down and to check social spending?"
"What have we gained from this cult of price stability, at a time when our economies are suffering, not as a result of inflation but of deflation?"
"Do you realise what each of these fine steps forward praised by Commissioner Solbes mean for people’s lives?"
"In France, today, they are nothing more than a good mark, given for freezing public spending until 2007 and even reducing it – and this covers the budgets for young people, education, work, accommodation, transport, research – and for halving current health spending."
"This is an unacceptable prospect for the French people, and for the citizens of Germany, Italy, Portugal or anywhere else and I believe it is frankly irresponsible to have forced the future Member States beforehand to undergo shock therapy – which actually consists of shocks without any therapy – in the name of an or accepted body of Community legislation which, incidentally, is by no means accepted by millions of Europeans."
"It is true that there is a deep need for social transformation and, therefore, for change in European policies."
"It would be marvellous if the European Council did not create a deadlock over this clear state of crisis and instead gave us its diagnosis and solutions, followed by a real debate with our fellow citizens."
"One alternative approach is for us to address monetary policy and hence the role and workings of the European Central Bank."
"The priority of monetary policy and of the ECB must, we believe, be to promote human capacities and consequently, first of all, making employment and training more secure for everyone."
"Their task would then be to make our countries much less dependent on the financial markets."
"Politics must control the market and not the other way around."
"Consequently, the idea of a selective credit policy, which would be extremely favourable to the investments that support our new political priorities but a real deterrent to those who do not support them, would come up against a genuine confrontation of opinions."
"This, in any event, is the type of debate that needs to be held to enable Europe’s citizens to state their feelings about the draft Constitution in full knowledge of the facts."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, quite a few of my colleagues have already drawn attention to the precarious economic situation and have also asked for structural remedies to be put in place."
"Nevertheless, we are being bombarded with conflicting reports on a daily basis."
"Here in Belgium, people have been hit hard by the report, this week, that 3 000 workers in Ford Genk are to lose their jobs."
"The fact that a reduction in the sales of a specific car model can have such an impact, that heavy and promised investments were withdrawn and that all this employment disappears in one fell swoop, can also have major implications for the rest of Europe."
"Today, the lead article of an important newspaper was entitled: ‘Is Ford set to disappear across Europe?’"
"I do not want to dwell on this any further, but I would still like to ask you to come up with realistic solutions that no longer create the impression that employment is something that capitalists can play about with. People now have the impression that they are being put upon."
"A second concern which you expressed is that for peace."
"You know that our great concern with regard to the Middle East is growing by the day."
"Since the war in Iraq, peace has not been established."
"We would like the United Nations and the European Union to be able to play their part there, but it is with sorrow that we see how the entire region seems more and more to think that it can offer military solutions."
"The fact that a wall is now being erected there, partly even in occupied territories, to screen Israel from the Palestinians, makes a mockery of the phased plan's intention."
"The fact that new settlements are still being planned makes a mockery of the phased plan."
"Where does the phased plan lead?"
"It is a road to nowhere."
"We must take action."
"We must monitor this plan at ground level, and we must ensure that the situation does not escalate any further."
"What happened after the dramatic attack in Haifa, an attack deep in Syria, and one that we deplore and denounce, simply invites further military escalation."
"The Turkish parliament’s decision to send troops to Iraq from Turkey, goes against the wishes of the Turkish population, but has been taken under American pressure; it also goes against the wishes of the interim government and of the Iraqi Kurds and is clearly intended as a threat to the PKK."
"The Turkish population fears, with good reason, that this will spark another spiral of violence."
"The Iranian regime too, whilst meeting with strong criticism from public opinion at home, is reaping profit from the situation in Iraq."
"They are the victors."
"They are gaining more influence over their Shiite fellow believers, not only in society, but even in the government, and they are now putting the pressure on to destroy the Mujahedin."
"This is once again an attempt to force a military solution, a bogus solution in other words, while we continue to talk about a roadmap to peace."
"I am asking the European countries, the Commission, the Presidency of the Council to come up with answers to these pressing questions."
"Can we still, under these circumstances, cooperate with Israel without imposing conditions?"
"Can we still keep the Association Agreement in operation?"
"Can we continue to turn a blind eye to the obvious presence in Israel of nuclear weapons, kept in reserve as a political lever, but also as an alibi to be able to wage conventional wars more easily?"
"Is it not there that we should be looking for weapons of mass destruction?"
"Should the Atomic Energy Agency not intervene and do its job?"
"I am therefore asking for a less resigned and a more active stance on the part of the Quartet, and I hope that we can still curb the spreading of war and that we can truly turn into the direction of peace once again."
"Mr President, the focus at the forthcoming summit of European Union leaders will primarily be an economic one."
"Coming so soon after the Rome Council meeting, it is in itself a clear indication by our leaders of their intent to put in place measures to reinvigorate the European economy."
"The European economy needs to be reinvigorated."
"This year growth has been less than 1%, which by any standards is an exceptionally poor performance."
"Whilst economic fundamentals remain basically sound, growth within the European Union is clearly sluggish and investor and consumer confidence is very low."
"We must really answer the question as to what we must do to turn around this economic situation."
"The bottom line, as a number of colleagues have said here this afternoon, is that now is the time for decisive action to be taken."
"The Lisbon Strategy must be implemented in its entirety across all its strands."
"The European Union must become the strongest knowledge-based economy in the world."
"This is imperative if we are to remain competitive and attract direct foreign investment into our community."
"This means that we must take full advantage of the new and evolving information technologies that are coming on stream."
"Equally, the benefit of new technologies must be spread to all regions in Europe and to both urban and rural areas."
"European Union leaders must work towards completing all outstanding components of the EU financial services action plan, as well as creating a level playing field for mergers and company take-overs."
"Completing a fully-effective internal market requires the progressive creation of an integrated market for gas and electricity to enhance security of supply in Europe."
"European leaders must look to promote initiatives which guarantee that pension payments can be made in the future for an ageing population."
"Notwithstanding the economic nature of this summit, it would be very hard for European Union leaders to ignore the escalating violence in the Middle East, and nor, indeed, should they."
"I believe that the European Union has a role to play in brokering a ceasefire between the various factions in the Middle East and I would strongly urge the Italian Government, Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, to continue to remain actively involved in the Middle East at this critical juncture."
"Finally, discussions will undoubtedly take place on the margins of the summit with regard to the provisions of the new European Union Treaty."
"It appears that negotiations in this respect started quite well at the weekend and we wish the Italian presidency every success in giving us, at the end of the day, a package that will be for the benefit of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, a new opinion poll shows that, at present, only half the Danish population has heard of the draft European Constitution."
"Seventy-eight per cent want there still to be a Commissioner from each country."
"Only 12% are prepared to do away with such a representative."
"The Danish Government has therefore now at long last joined the chorus demanding a Commissioner from each country."
"I collected 123 signatures to that effect in the Convention."
"For all that, it does not form a part of the Convention’s draft, and this shows how the word ‘consensus’ can be misused when ordinary democratic procedures involving proposals, amendments and votes are abandoned."
"Better late than never, however."
"Will the Presidency of the Council now confirm that it is campaigning for a Commission with a representative for each country with full rights?"
"The next demand must therefore be that it should be the voters themselves or the national parliaments that choose their Commissioners."
"The elected representatives, who are answerable to their national parliaments, could report – in the Danish representative’s case, each Friday to the Europe Committee – on what they did the previous week and on what they intend to vote for the following week. They could inform the public and act as the elected representatives of the voters in the body that has a monopoly on tabling legislative proposals."
"They could be the voters’ representatives in Brussels instead of Brussels’ representatives in relation to the voters."
"Being elected by the national parliaments would be no obstacle to the Commissioners’ also being accountable, as managers of their portfolios, to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"On this point, the next Treaty should include a proper statement of the Commissioners’ responsibilities, corresponding to the ministerial responsibility familiar from civilised democracies."
"A minister or a Commissioner must also be responsible for things about which he or she was unaware."
"We cannot have a Solbes, who does not accept responsibility because he did not know what was going on in Eurostat."
"He has managerial responsibility, whether or not he is to blame."
"He must accept responsibility and, in the process, ensure that the culprits are held to account."
"Before the Constitution is finally adopted at the Intergovernmental Conference, every subject in it should be discussed thoroughly by the people."
"How will the Presidency guarantee that the outcome does not come as a bad surprise for the majority of voters in our countries?"
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, in a few days time in Brussels there will be discussions on reviving the economy, and I am concerned that they will end up reopening the debate on the Stability Pact, on whether it takes the right line, that there will end up being a debate between States that are asking to be able to spend more and to be able to increase their deficit beyond the commitments made in the Pact itself."
"I fear that – sadly, once again – there will be no discussion as to what the European Union and the European Institutions could do to encourage and to contribute to the EU’s economic growth."
"Mr Prodi, a little more than a year ago, you commissioned a high-level group of experts to carry out a study on an agenda for a Europe with an expanding economy."
"This study made some very specific, very thorough and very important recommendations on what the European Union could do to contribute to growth, first and foremost by re-orientating its own internal budget, that of the European institutions: in fact, we also need to question the approach taken by the European budget, to ask to what extent it helps economic growth."
"This group of experts, then – the committee chaired by André Sapir – made an extremely clear proposal: re-direct the European institutions’ budget, the 1.25% of European GDP, which is only a small amount but is being put to very poor use and does not serve to contribute towards European growth."
"The recommendation was quite clear: a major political decision has to be made, and this decision involves removing the burden of the common agricultural policy, which takes up and accounts for almost half of our funds, from the European budget."
"The funds that would be freed up by merely rethinking agricultural policy and agricultural protection, which has such a negative impact on the image of Europe abroad, could – thanks, not least, to the leverage effect – help give an enormous boost to economic research and to technological innovation, which needs to be financed by large-scale saving which only Brussels can provide."
"These same resources could also be used to boost the implementation of the infamous European networks to better connect markets."
"All this could be done, but it is not being done."
"I believe that, at European level, we need, first and foremost, to reassess our budget and our agricultural policy, otherwise, it will become increasingly pointless to pontificate about the Lisbon objectives."
"One final thought, Mr President: immigration will be discussed."
"This is a good thing and I hope that a clear signal will be given to European citizens that immigrants are and can be an asset to economic growth rather than a problem."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, first and foremost, the next meeting must take stock of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which opened last Saturday in Rome."
"In my opinion, the result is favourable on the whole: the adopted text gives us good cause for hope after the pessimistic forecasts beforehand."
"I, personally, am optimistic, having experienced the Convention’s shilly-shallying, problems and difficulties;"
"I am absolutely convinced that no one will want to take responsibility for letting two years work fail, no one will want to take political responsibility for failing to give Europe the Constitution that 450 million citizens are expecting."
"Of course, no substantial compromise should be made on the Constitution text; of course, small adjustments will have to be made, but the balance of the Constitution should remain as it is."
"What adjustments can be made?"
"I firmly believe that the areas where majority voting is used should be extended: unanimity is an obstacle; it is a concrete pillar blocking the EU’s progress."
"I also firmly believe that a compromise can be reached on the number of Commissioners: in my view, the countries that will be part of the EU from 2004 should be represented from the outset; subsequently, we could see if we could get round the problem by using Commissioners without portfolio, but I feel that, to start with, there has to be a Commissioner for each of the countries that will be a Member of the EU."
"Then, of course, I also firmly believe that an explicit reference to Europe’s Judaeo-Christian roots should be written into the preamble to the Constitution."
"I would also like to pause a moment to praise the Italian Presidency – as Mr Barón Crespo has just done."
"A commitment was made in the Chamber in Strasbourg to ensuring that the European Parliament was represented at the Intergovernmental Conference: this has been the case and can be seen as a success for this House."
"I am sure that Parliament will be able to continue to make a useful contribution during the debate."
"The second issue, Mr President, is reviving the economy."
"Yesterday – and we can only welcome this – Ecofin gave the go-ahead for the first step in implementing the trans-European networks: these are major plans that will create new jobs as well as making our regions and our countries more competitive."
"When prioritising, President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we need to focus clearly on a Europe that is going from the West towards the East, but also at the Europe which is looking from the North to the South."
"We can only revive the economy by pursuing the Lisbon process: raising the retirement age is a necessary reform, we need to give an answer to our children so that there is a system which guarantees their future in 10, 20, 30, 40 years’ time."
"Furthermore, I also agree with Mr Prodi on the issue of research: this is a commitment made by the current President-in-Office of the Council in his speech in Strasbourg, and I firmly believe that the future of our economy depends on promoting investment in research as well."
"Turning now to the final issue, immigration, it cannot be a national issue."
"Italy has 700 km of coastline, which is not just the Italian border, but also Europe’s southern border."
"Because of this, there is absolutely no doubt about the fact that it is the EU’s duty not only to take on some organisational responsibility, in terms of policing measures, but also to shoulder economic responsibility in this regard."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we should indeed not underestimate the significance of the next Brussels summit, or the effect that it will have."
"The public will take a sceptical view of this Europe of ours for as long as they feel that nothing, or virtually nothing, is being done to provide them with more jobs."
"They will also take a sceptical view of the European Union for as long as they do not see investment in their infrastructure, sufficient to modernise it and to make our continent more competitive."
"Not merely economic but also psychological factors are involved in restoring to Europe the courage and determination it will need to be a leading continent."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you said that there is to be more investment in infrastructure and in research and development."
"In ECOFIN, the finance ministers have once again got cold feet."
"Mr Watson may be happy with that, but I am not, and I hope that the prime ministers will get the better of their finance ministers when it comes to real investment in the modernisation of infrastructure."
"You referred to the market in electricity."
"Does not our liberalisation of the electricity market without ensuring sufficient investment, especially in the grid, create a problem?"
"We will now have the same problem with the railways."
"We have decided to deregulate them, and are in the process of putting together a second railways package, which will mean cutting tariffs and prices."
"If, however, we do not at the same time require the public sector – and, where possible, the private sector – to invest in the railway network, we will see the same thing happen as has happened in Great Britain, where too little investment has meant also too little investment in people’s safety, more accidents and hence a discredited public sector."
"At the end of the day, I believe, it has to be made abundantly clear that this is not about jeopardising the Stability Pact."
"If anything today endangers the Stability Pact, it is the rigidly dogmatic interpretation of it, which leads the public to see it as a bad thing."
"If it is applied intelligently, sensibly and flexibly, in the way that the President of the Commission has called for on many occasions, without it taking us back to a massive Budget deficit, then that will be the Stability Pact’s salvation, as the budgets that are currently at risk are not in that position through too much being invested in the countries in question; many of them are at risk from excessive consumer spending."
"Investment, though, would make for increased growth."
"Let me just say something brief about foreign policy."
"Reference has already been made to the situation in the Middle East, and it will be further discussed tomorrow."
"I believe that the Council, and the European Union as a whole, must unambiguously repudiate terrorism and make that clear to any and every country that flirts with it – which is not always to say that they support it, but that they tolerate it."
"It must, though, be made equally plain to Israel that it must not perpetuate the cycle of violence or even, perhaps, set one in motion."
"Recent months have seen quite enough acts of aggression in the Middle East, founded on the assertion that there were dangerous weapons here, weapons of mass destruction there, and terrorism somewhere else still, all of which has often turned out to be untrue."
"We have to make it perfectly clear to Israel that, while we endorse its firm commitment to self-determination and to countering terrorism, it too has a contribution to make towards achieving peace."
"If I may make a final comment, you said nothing about Russia and Chechnya."
"Chechnya has just had elections that were a farce, and I think we also need to speak plain language to Russia, which is an important partner for the European Union."
"Your prime minister, Mr Berlusconi, thinks highly of Mr Putin, he is a friend of his and gives him very warm welcomes. At the same time, though, Mr Berlusconi is not inclined to mince his words."
"I believe that Mr Berlusconi should tell Mr Putin quite bluntly that we cannot put up with what is going on in Chechnya."
"This is the time for Russia, too, to work out a policy for bringing peace to Chechnya."
"Mr President, we are grateful that the Secretary of State made a report on the first session of the IGC."
"I have to say that, like Mr Barón Crespo, I greatly regret the suppression of the notion of the Legislative Council, a decision which will not foster the separation of powers within the European Union."
"The more serious problem appears to be caused by Spain and Poland, on the grounds that they are to lose the blocking minority they enjoy beneath the Treaty of Nice."
"I have to say that these are spurious grounds for complaint."
"The facts are that Spain and Poland need several more partners to join with them to reach the 38% of the population needed to block a decision."
"The Convention proposes to lower the QMV threshold from 62% to 60%: a mere 9 million people."
"This is at best a marginal question of bruised self-esteem for Spain and Poland."
"On Thursday, I trust the true friends of Spain and Poland will explain to Mr Aznar and Mr Miller that they should drop their complaint and assist the IGC in reaching a speedy political agreement to respect the first and second parts of the Constitution."
"The IGC will then be free to proceed to refurbish and modernise Part III, which is its proper responsibility."
"– Mr President, the severe economic slowdown, the stagnation, the recession and the increase in unemployment and poverty are some of the more visible manifestations of the failure of the European Central Bank’s rigid monetary policy and the budgetary consolidation procedure blindly imposed by the nominal convergence criteria."
"Modifying the spirit of the Stability Pact, therefore, is not enough. Neither is implementing it more flexibly."
"It is becoming increasingly obvious that an in-depth review of the pact’s objectives and criteria is required if monetary and budgetary policies are to contribute to economic growth and employment."
"I would like to ask the Commission and the Council the following question, therefore: when calculating the 3% budget deficit, are you prepared to discount, with immediate effect, public spending and costs incurred as a result of exceptional circumstances, such as the fires which devastated Portugal this summer?"
"Such a measure is urgently needed."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when, on 10 July, a standing ovation greeted the Convention’s adoption, in this room, of the draft constitution, the elation on the one side and the disappointment of the other could not obscure the fact that we had found the highest common denominator for the future of Europe."
"Now, here it comes again – the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The bazaar is open to those who trade in national interests."
"The governments have again seized control of the European constitutional process and act out the wielding of their power in splendour and pomp on a feudal stage, on which they make great affirmations of belief in Europe, whilst behind its scenery, people are already shouting the odds about their national interests."
"Although the Convention must be silent, now is the time for this House to speak up as the trustee and advocate of this, the greatest possible European consensus."
"We cannot stand by and watch as this replay of Amsterdam and Nice, perhaps with the outcome of Nice II or Nice III, takes us to the slippery slope and back to the lowest common European denominator."
"Far from being a task force or a preparatory group composed of motley experts, this Convention was a unique forum of all the national parliaments, including those of the accession countries, including those of Spain and Poland, of all the national governments, including those of Finland and Austria, and it was also a forum for the European institutions, Parliament and the Commission."
"After eighteen months of negotiation, a great and historic consensus was achieved."
"Under pressure from the governments, the Convention cut much of it out."
"The parliaments were represented; it is they, rather than the governments, who are the masters of the treaties, and they wanted to go a good deal further alongside us."
"Under pressure from the governments, we made great compromises."
"Now is the time for us, in this House, to remind the governments that negotiations involve such a thing as good faith, and that, at the end of eighteen months of negotiations, you cannot behave as if you were not there and put on a shadow-boxing show that pits large against small and East against West, bearing no relation whatever to reality."
"I was very much surprised that the President of the Commission had nothing to say about this historic course of events, but large versus small is not Europe’s game."
"Simply rotating the presidencies of both the Commission and the Council is enough to represent the equality of all countries."
"It is, though, the attack by the national executives on European parliamentary life that must be combated, and it will be the public who will pay the price."
"The idea of a Legislative Council was central to the separation of the powers in the European democracy, central to Parliamentary control of the Council, central to the public character of European lawmaking and to the idea of its proximity to the citizen – yet it was disposed of at the first sitting!"
"Disposed of consensually at the first sitting, without asking either the parliaments or the European institutions, all of which had asked for it!"
"This is an attack on the hard-won majority decisions that were to make Europe capable of acting!"
"The European Public Prosecutor, the public nature of lawmaking – this is not shadowboxing; this is an all-out assault on the very idea of Europe’s new architecture as a European democracy and as a great step forward towards its political unification."
"It is for us in the European Parliament, being also delegates to the Convention, to publicly denounce this national tug-of-war, to do so with all possible determination, and as loudly as we can, so that it is not just nationalism that makes its voice heard in Europe, but also the ideal of political unity!"
"Mr President, it would have been nice if previous speakers had not doubled their speaking time, because we all have other engagements after this debate."
"Courtesy is not, however, the most common feature of this Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, one of your illustrious predecessors, Jacques Delors, said in a recent interview that the European Parliament would do better to deal with matters of concern to Europe’s citizens rather than focusing on human rights in Guatemala or on women’s rights in Equatorial Guinea."
"These are undoubtedly interesting matters but, at the moment, what Europeans are more concerned with – and something that the Brussels Summit, if I am not mistaken, is due to address – is the incredible growth deficit that is threatening to engulf the European economy and, within the European economy, those countries in particular that chose to put their fate in the hands of the euro and the European Central Bank."
"Whatever the criteria selected, be it debt, deficit, growth, unemployment, inflation – the three Member States that did not opt for the euro and which have kept their national currency are doing the best, including – see the Commission report on this matter – in the field of competition and the Lisbon strategy."
"The three countries that should be stepping up to receive their medals are the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, which has, moreover, just given an unequivocal response to European monetary policy."
"Because the Brussels summit is due to oversee the changeover between Mr Duisenberg and Mr Trichet, perhaps it could consider the policy that has been conducted since the euro was introduced in 1999?"
"Incidentally, Commissioner Prodi, that event is something for which your mandate will be remembered, because you took office before the euro had been introduced and you will leave after it has been established."
"One incredible aspect of this currency is that it is propelled towards peaks by the dollar – not of its own free will but like a cork tossed up by the power of the wave – whereas everyone knows that thousands of jobs are being axed every day, as the result both of a Malthusian policy and now of a negligent attitude towards the currency market which makes the euro the main handicap to the European economy, particularly for the countries in the euro zone."
"Mr President, Commissioner Prodi, on this matter, which is one of the European citizens’ deepest concerns, is anyone going to remind the European Central Bank of its job, which is to ensure growth, or at least to ensure that we have a currency that benefits the European economy?"
"Mr President, after many years of greatly underestimating the problem represented by the perils of illegal immigration, today, at last, if somewhat belatedly, the European institutions seem to be starting to take an encouraging line by beginning to make the set of policies designed to address and combat practically the challenge of illegal immigration fairer and more effective."
"The Council has to move on, then – that is what the is calling for – spurred on, not least, by the effective impetus of the Italian Presidency."
"It is precisely on these issues that we were pleased to hear a clear, precise report by Mr Antonione, representative of the Italian Presidency, on the lines that are emerging from the Justice and Home Affairs Council’s work and discussions: a substantial proposal to set up a border management agency, particularly for sea borders."
"Mr Tajani rightly pointed out the importance of having 700 km of borders in our country, at Europe’s southern boundary."
"Then there is the quota policy, and thus integration, which must be dealt with in relation to employment and not with populist proposals that give too much ground, such as the proposal put forward by Mr Fini to give the vote to third country nationals: this would be a step in the wrong direction, it is an inappropriate proposal which is out of place, which goes in the opposite direction from a responsible, specific commitment – the direction in which the European institutions are going – to strive to oppose illegality."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the opening last week in Rome of the Intergovernmental Conference, which has the task of producing the definitive text of the European Constitution, was marked by the President-in-Office of the Council’s call for goodwill and by the willing optimism of several Member States including France and Germany."
"The Italian President-in-Office of the Council stressed that this Conference is the Conference of European will, of Europe’s will to be Europe and political will is going to be the keyword of this Intergovernmental Conference."
"The groundwork has been done by the European Convention, chaired by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and it is now up to Ministers to demonstrate that they have this will with, of course, the additional possibility of improving the draft Constitution that we now have."
"Some Member States of the Union are openly threatening to oppose any outcome that would call into question what they call the ‘Nice ’."
"I deplore this attitude, because stability must not be confused with stasis."
"Was it not, after all, the Laeken European Council that fervently wanted the Treaties to be revised to ensure more democracy, more simplicity and more transparency?"
"Besides, following the unanimously acknowledged success of the Community method, so brilliantly illustrated by the European conventions on the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on the Constitution, our partners cannot act as if the Union were simply an intergovernmental organisation."
"We must lead the way in order to ensure that enlargement is a success."
"The forthcoming European Council must also apply itself to revitalising the economy, as several speakers have said."
"On this subject, I am pleased at the growing awareness of the fact that the stability chapter of the European economy should not be able to relegate the chapter dealing with growth, business start-ups and employment into second place."
"Our citizens expect their leaders to create conditions that will enable Europe to be dynamic, prosperous and more cooperative."
"Only by freeing our economies of the burden of excessive taxation and excessive bureaucracy will we be able to create lasting wealth and enable the majority of society to benefit from this wealth."
"This once again requires the political will to undertake reforms that are far-reaching and sometimes relatively unpopular in the short term."
"Some countries in the Union, including France, are boldly setting about this task and I hope that these efforts are not only acknowledged but also receive encouragement from Europe."
"Lastly, in the field of external relations, I wish to tell the Presidency of the Union how important we consider the Rule of Law together with protecting human dignity to be in managing the external borders of an enlarged Europe, as well as respect for the international legitimacy of the UN in combating international terrorism."
"Whether in the European Union or elsewhere in the world, now is the time for multilateralism and for joint action and not for going it alone."
"Mr President, there is a statement by the President-in-Office of the Council which could appear positive but which worries me very much."
"You have spoken, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, of new common initiatives at European level in the field of immigration."
"Do you know why it worries me?"
"Because we have not yet reached any agreement on any of the old European common initiatives in the field of immigration."
"It worries me enormously that we are increasing the volume of paperwork that we already have in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on European initiatives in this field without achieving any results."
"There is just one single Directive (of those proposed by the Commission), just one, on which an agreement has been reached: the one on family regrouping."
"And it is a compendium of exceptions – there are more exceptions than there are Member States – and it is such a weak Directive that we will have to wait to see what this Parliament does with it."
"Because, in reality, what it has generated inside and outside this Parliament is enormous frustration."
"We need agreements on what the Commission has already proposed in relation to the legal framework for the management of legal immigration."
"We do not need a lot more ideas: they are all on the table."
"I am worried also because when we talk about new initiatives, we talk about somersaults."
"Somersaults like the one the President of the Commission has communicated to us and which is entitled ‘European fund for the return of immigrants’."
"This leaves me entirely perplexed."
"Can you explain to me the added value of action relating to the return of immigrants?"
"Can you explain to me what contribution will be made by a European fund which cannot be created at the moment by the Member States, who have full competence in the field of return?"
"Are you telling me that they cannot exercise these competences because they do not have sufficient money to do so and that we therefore need a European fund in order to implement the national competence of expelling citizens who are here illegally?"
"I really do not understand this."
"I am however in agreement, and I think it is a good idea, with the common management of borders."
"I do actually believe that we need to do something here, and I would be in favour of supporting the Commission's proposal."
"I would like to end by saying that an element of border control relates to immigration and another which relates to crime, as you have said."
"I am very much in favour of combating organised crime and I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, whether, in this field and within the field of justice and home affairs, you believe you will be able to implement the European arrest warrant before the date set, as planned by this House and the Council?"
"Mr President, I am pleased that EU leaders will finally address the case for legal migration, although we have to be clear that numbers or quotas must be set at national level and not by Brussels."
"The Council continues to focus mainly on keeping people out of Fortress Europe."
"We still have no agreement on integrating legal immigrants, or on core aspects of a common asylum system; no agreement on making racism illegal in criminal law, and no agreement on fighting human trafficking through protection of victims and encouraging them to be witnesses."
"For all the rhetoric, how many people-traffickers have actually been put behind bars?"
"The summit will look at all the proposals for developing new databases on EU and foreign citizens, including biometric identifiers."
"This all raises big questions of privacy and civil liberties, but it has been done in secret and with no democratic control."
"Finally, I hope leaders will rectify their shameful failure so far to act jointly to secure release or a fair trial in a civil court for the 25 Europeans in Guantanamo Bay."
"We are meant to have a common foreign policy and a human rights policy."
"So far, for those citizens in Guantanamo Bay, there is little to show for this."
"I hope that will change at the summit."
"Mr President, the Brussels European Council should, in line with the Italian proposal, examine the idea of a programme of major works to stimulate growth."
"In principle, we are in favour of these projects, which should focus not only on transport but also on the environment, telecommunications and research and development, as set out in the Franco-German initiative."
"Indeed, we believe that these works should – in principle – eventually improve productivity in the internal market."
"They should – also in principle – be eligible for part-funding by borrowing because they will benefit future generations, on the condition, however, that we do not allow debt to get out of control."
"This, though, is where the problem lies."
"We have serious doubts as to the ability attributed to these projects to stimulate growth."
"First of all, of course, there will be delays in implementing the projects, but this is not the key issue."
"The key issue is that their benefits will be impeded, or even cancelled out by the problems holding back growth in Europe and which have almost brought it back to zero."
"There are first of all structural constraints, such as the reduction of the working week in France, which are not being corrected as rapidly as they should be."
"We then have the phenomenon of industrial and agricultural relocation that is causing problems for Europe, a phenomenon that we have condemned since the Uruguay Round and which is now growing worse, with terrible consequences for growth and employment."
"The third factor that is pushing us towards a situation of zero growth are the rigidities of monetary union, which admittedly provides some advantages, such as eliminating national currency fluctuations, but which also has disadvantages, such as eliminating a decentralised and flexible form of monetary management only to replace it with a centralised and uniform system."
"Even in the context of the current system, we should at least try to conduct a more active currency policy that punishes our economy less."
"In any event, Mr President, unless these three serious obstacles to growth are removed, major works will not stimulate growth and, even worse, will put us in debt for no good reason."
"– Mr President, the forthcoming European Council will be yet another step towards a Constitutional Treaty."
"It is remarkable that the media always emphasise the differences of opinion between the governments, an issue completely unrelated to the true meaning of such a treaty for the EU’s own citizens."
"It would be much better – as many are aware – to explain to the citizens that the object of the exercise is to guarantee the same level of legal protection for every EU citizen throughout the European Union, and that this is particularly achieved by including the Charter in the Treaty."
"This is a fantastic achievement and it is worth pointing this out very clearly in the Treaty."
"Everyone says that they are agreed on 90% of the result that is presently before us, but, in fact, too much notice is being taken of the 10%, which could not possibly be very important, especially since the Council is now clearly stating that there is consensus about the basic ideas."
"This is what should characterise the publicity surrounding the Convention results."
"In terms of our relations with the outside world, the drawing up of the Constitution is also extremely important, because no third country should be in any doubt about the fact that the European Union is an alliance of democratic constitutional states."
"This fact cannot be altered and on this score, nothing should be overlooked."
"We should say this emphatically to some Balkan countries, as we do to Turkey."
"Needless to say, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats very much hopes that the structural reforms themselves will be assessed on the basis of a wide European outlook, taking into consideration the interests of all and the need for clarity for the sake of the citizens."
"Let me make a small point about the appointment of Commissioners."
"You often hear that every country should have its own Commissioner."
"It seems to me a matter of extreme importance that we in this House should, at some point, spell out to the outside world that, as soon as we discover that a Commissioner has adopted a national stance, we then step in to remove them from their post."
"Karel van Miert, from Belgium, once stated in his memoirs that the minute you are sworn in as Commissioner, you lose your nationality."
"Whatever we decide with regard to appointing Commissioners, we should constantly bear this in mind: never and on no occasion should the impression be created that the appointment could be of a national nature."
"There is a foreign policy issue about which I should like to say something."
"Certain things are going extremely well, for example the police missions in Bosnia Herzegovina and in Macedonia, or the military action under the leadership of one of our Member States in Congo."
"We also know, however, that major problems still exist elsewhere, for example in western Africa, where various fires are smouldering."
"We as a civil superpower can play a preventive role in the countries where violence has not yet broken out."
"Our role is then to damp down the fires in neighbouring areas."
"I would in this connection mention Guinea-Bissau, which is in urgent need of assistance in the run-up to regular elections, which it now wants, and aid from Europe will certainly be needed."
"I would thus invite the Council and the Commission to explore the possibilities for peaceful intervention to maintain peace in that country."
"I hope that the Council will be characterised by responsibility and solidarity, and thereby give an enormous boost to public confidence in Europe."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor again, very briefly, to thank all the Members who have spoken in this debate, who have made an important contribution, at times critical but, as far as we are concerned, a valuable contribution in terms of proposals and guidelines for the tasks before us, both as regards the issues that will be addressed by next week’s European Council as it seeks to find solutions to the issues that we have discussed, and also as regards the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I am also very pleased to note that Mr Prodi’s report and the report that we have drawn up as the Presidents-in-Office of the European Council are in perfect harmony."
"I hope that this presages excellent work, and good results."
"I would like to conclude my brief reply by confirming the commitment given by the Italian Presidency to the European Parliament to report all the developments of the Intergovernmental Conference immediately and to confirm our willingness to take part in focused debates between the Council Presidency and Parliament, this also being a way of ensuring that the best possible results are achieved."
"Thank you, Minister."
"The debate is closed."
"The propaganda-driven support for economic recovery for the Brussels summit is confined to means used a thousand times before: neo-Keynesian methods and ‘New Deal’ type mini programmes which are now proven to be unable to bring about positive results for the workers and which increase exploitation, unemployment and poverty."
"These measures merely safeguard contracts for the large companies and support the concentration of capital, especially when accompanied by measures to cut back the workers' employment and social rights."
"Pension rights and pension funds are again in the line of fire and the generalisation of ‘flexibility’ in employment and wage freezes are being promoted in the name of competitiveness and reducing labour costs."
"Immigration and respect for human rights are also in the line of fire."
"We are seeing coordinated measures to deport, extradite and ‘move on’ immigrants, border guards on land and sea and other measures which offend human dignity and guarantee even greater exploitation of immigrants."
"And all just a few days after the start of the Intergovernmental Conference which is being called upon to secure capitalism constitutionally, to redistribute power between the powerful and to cede even more national sovereignty to the Euro-unifying centre."
"It is certain that the peoples will not remain inert in the face of the further intensification of the attack and will develop even further their fight to resist and counter attack."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report (Α5-0313/2003) by Mrs Frassoni on the conclusion of the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’ between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and"
"- the second report (Α5-0235/2003) by Mr Medina Ortega on simplifying and improving Community legislation."
"Mr President, I have asked to divide my speech into two parts: one now, lasting three minutes, and another lasting two minutes, after the debate."
"I would like to speak now about the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’."
"This agreement was the result of difficult, lengthy negotiations in which we all asked ourselves – Parliament, the Commission and the Council, but us, above all, I have to say – if it would not be better quietly to give up, given the difficulty of trying to find any real advantages over the current situation."
"First of all I would like to thank Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg, with whom we had a good working relationship, as well as the technical group that negotiated with us, for, ultimately, a positive outcome was, in any case, achieved."
"Therefore, if we are here to urge Parliament to support this agreement, it is because I believe that – albeit minor, tentative – progress has been made."
"I would like to focus, in particular, on two issues that I feel are of particular significance: co-regulation and self-regulation."
"Not so much because the results achieved were ground-breaking but because I believe that, if we use it properly – particularly we in this House – this agreement will make it easier to combat an extremely worrying trend, which I am sorry to say the Commission and the Council seem to endorse, the trend towards alternative methods of regulation to legislation, and here I am referring, in particular, to what are known as voluntary agreements."
"Recent experience in the field of road safety and CO2 in cars has shown us that the risks of not achieving objectives, in terms of effectiveness and enforcement across the board, which a normal law could have achieved, are very real where these voluntary agreements are used."
"It is precisely in response to this potential danger that we have become extensively involved in this difficult debate, which included many other elements too – as Members will be able to see if they read the text, there is also a lot of waffle – but, at least, on the issues of self-regulation and co-regulation, some minor progress has been achieved."
"We must, however, fully admit to defeat in one area: we did not succeed in getting the right of call-back from the Commission – the right to suspend the use of a voluntary agreement if we do not approve of it."
"We are extremely disappointed about this because it was the Commission – and this has to be said – that did not want to step down on this point."
"We have simply obtained a political willingness from the Commission to take unambiguous, clear opposition from Parliament into consideration."
"If it is deemed necessary, it will, therefore, be up to Parliament to organise opposition to the voluntary agreement in order to force the Commission to recall it itself."
"One last thing, Mr President: the difficulty that the Commission and the Council have in going further in this area seems to be exactly the same as that we encountered in the negotiations on comitology, which we hope has been overcome once and for all thanks to the agreements concluded by the Convention."
". – Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has been dealing with this issue since the beginning of 2002."
"We were responding to several Commission communications which raised the problem of the shortcomings in Community regulations."
"I remember how, in conversation with a Spanish national legislator – a very experienced one, by the way – he told me that nobody could understand Community directives."
"We do so much work on them and so many people are involved in their production: the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament and so many others, that in the end we have a text which could be described as a ‘camel’, in other words, a horse designed by a committee."
"And that is the real situation."
"While we must recognise that the regulation is a little more appropriate, the directive, on the other hand, is a real disaster."
"The Commission’s natural concern was of course to improve this situation, a concern which the Council and Parliament also share."
"Above all at a time when Parliament is increasing its legislative powers, it makes no sense for us to continue with this procedure for producing legislation."
"At the same time, however, we in the Committee on Legal Affairs realised that, in order for the Commission's proposals to come to fruition, it would be necessary to provide a constitutional framework suited to this issue."
"We raised this within the first points of the report, and then the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which had decided to produce a series of reports after debating the issue with the Committee on Legal Affairs, realised the importance of the issue in terms of Parliament’s institutional role and, on a very sound basis, accepted the report."
"Meanwhile, we insisted on our conviction – and that of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs as well – that it was necessary to reach an interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions in order to prevent the respective institutions from being deprived of their powers."
"I believe that the result of this exercise – during which the two different committees of Parliament, Legal Affairs and Constitutional Affairs, have dealt with the issue – has been positive."
"I believe that the interinstitutional agreement reached is a good agreement and I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Frassoni, on the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the work she herself has done and also the good work done by President Gargani and many members of that interinstitutional working group – Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg – and we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are happy with the result."
"This report for which I am rapporteur was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs before the interinstitutional agreement had been reached."
"We therefore proposed a series of recommendations to the interinstitutional group on it."
"Since the agreement has now been reached – and I believe that to a large extent our objectives have been achieved – I believe that the best option is for the report to be returned to the Committee on Legal Affairs so that we can, taking account of the actions included in the interinstitutional agreement, move forward on that basis."
"I would insist, of course – and here I agree with Mrs Frassoni – that we must deal with the problems of self-regulation and co-regulation."
"Because we are too happy to talk about civil society and then, when we talk about civil society here in the European Parliament and the European Union, we invite representatives from certain organisations, which somebody or other tells us are representative."
"But in reality, in democratic systems, civil society is expressed by means of the electoral process."
"The electoral process provides civil society with a formal means of expression, and the result of that electoral process is the legislative bodies, and it is they who have to adapt the general regulations."
"The problem with self-regulation and co-regulation is that they represent a step backwards; they mean returning to the Middle Ages, when certain sectors produced rules which bound everybody."
"In modern societies, these rules must come from society as a whole, by means of elected bodies, elected through perfectly formalised and guaranteed processes, which in this case means the European Parliament, the Council – insofar as the Council is made up of governments with elected leaders answerable to their national Parliaments – and also the Commission, insofar as it is elected by the Council and by the European Parliament."
"I therefore have the impression that the interinstitutional agreement has placed certain restrictions, but we in this Parliament must continue to insist on the need, on the one hand, to improve the quality of Community legislation and, on the other, not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and not to give up the progress made in our Europe through the development of the liberal and democratic State, which ensures that decisions are made by legislative bodies elected by popular will."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament debate and vote this week represent an important phase in the final chapter of negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which has resulted in the interinstitutional agreement on ‘Better Law-Making’."
"The initiative that led to the current outcome began with the Commission communication on better regulation and its action plan simplifying and improving the regulatory environment, but it was the enthusiasm of the European Parliament and its President that drove the European Council, which met in Seville in June 2002, to urge the three institutions to adopt an interinstitutional agreement which sought to improve the quality of Community law and the conditions of its incorporation, including deadlines, into national legislation."
"Our three institutions replied immediately to the request and opened negotiations."
"First of all, the work was carried out in the High-Level Technical Group and, in the final stages, took place at political level."
"The group of European correspondents undertook major preparatory work."
"On behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks to those who played a part in the positive conclusion of the agreement: in particular, Mrs Frassoni, her colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, and Mr Gargani, Mr Swoboda and Mr Clegg, representatives of Parliament, as well as Commissioner de Palacio, who represented the Commission in the preparation of this work."
"As for the Council, thanks are due to my predecessors of the Greek and Danish Presidencies."
"The agreement seeks, as set down in paragraph 1, ‘to improve the quality of law-making by means of a series of initiatives and procedures’, which are detailed in the agreement itself."
"I would like to point out, Mr President, that, in this agreement, our three institutions commit to ensuring better coordination, better communication and cooperation in carrying out their legislative responsibilities."
"In it we recognise the importance of greater transparency and accessibility and we are addressing the issue of turning to co-regulation and to self-regulation."
"We are renewing the commitment to improving the quality of legislation and to establishing procedures for pre-legislative consultation and impact assessment."
"We would stress the need to improve the transposal of Community law into national legislation."
"Finally, we are renewing our commitment to simplify and reduce the volume of legislation."
"Mr President, tomorrow, the European Parliament is going to vote on adopting the interinstitutional agreement ‘Better Law-Making’ and the Commission will formalise its approval in subsequent days."
"To complete the approval procedure, the General Affairs Council will adopt the decision to approve the agreement in next Monday’s session."
"It will be our task to ensure that the agreement is enforced faithfully and is fully adhered to."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for their contributions to the discussion on our initiatives in the field of ‘better law-making’."
"I reserve particular thanks for Mrs Frassoni and Mr Medina Ortega."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the three institutions have concluded an interinstitutional agreement on ‘better law-making’."
"This agreement clearly and broadly commits the three institutions to improving their working methodologies and the quality of law-making by means of a range of initiatives and procedures that it sets out."
"Consequently, the interinstitutional agreement establishes a solid base for improving the culture of clarity and coherence in drawing up legislative texts and for improving the programming and transparency of the legislative process, whilst respecting the powers and procedures laid down in the Treaties, and the broad principles of democratic legitimacy, subsidiarity and proportionality and legal security."
"The Commission finds the agreement to be extremely satisfactory."
"First of all, it is coherent with the proposals we made in the ‘better law-making’ action plan of June 2002."
"The lines that we then defined are now confirmed."
"Next, the agreement is well-balanced: it makes frequent references to the Commission’s own commitments but also notes the commitments of Parliament and the Council concerning improving the quality of regulations."
"In particular, it sets out provisions that complement the proposals contained in the action plan for the programming and transparency of legislative work."
"The agreement also establishes a definition of a stable framework for using so-called alternative instruments, or , which are co-regulation and self-regulation."
"The agreement will allow these instruments to be used and will prevent the multitude of problems encountered in the past when examining this type of measure on a case-by-case basis."
"Lastly, we should note the progress that has been made and the commitments that have been given with regard to impact studies and to simplifying the , and transposing Community law-making and monitoring its implementation."
"Now, of course, the greatest attention must be paid to ensuring that the agreement is implemented."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the interinstitutional agreement which we are talking about is the result of the negotiations within the high-level working party formed by representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council Presidency."
"Together with Mr Swoboda, Mr Clegg and Mrs Frassoni, I feel that we must thank the High Level Technical Group which helped us in our work, but I would, of course, also like to mention the contribution made by the politicians to the outcome achieved: an agreement which – although, as Mrs Frassoni said just now, it certainly fails to satisfy everybody in Parliament – I believe is an extremely important compromise, which we must acknowledge this evening in this House."
"We worked on the basis of the mandate given to us by the Conference of Presidents on 4 July, and I believe I can say that we adhered firmly to this brief and to this will, which, together with the President of the European Parliament, we often witnessed in individual and delegation meetings."
"The objectives set down in the mandate concerned adequate guarantees regarding Parliament’s rights as a legislative authority, complete transparency during the legislative procedure and the choice of innovative solutions conducive to more effective and responsible law-making."
"In short, Parliament’s aim was to enhance democratic legitimacy and the quality of Community legislation, which is something I believe we all want."
"Alongside the negotiations, the European Commission adopted a series of documents on simplifying and improving legislation, on which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market expressed its opinion by adopting Mr Medina Ortega’s report, which you have just heard presented."
"The draft interinstitutional agreement reasonably fulfils both the Conference of Presidents’ mandate and the guidelines that are contained in Mr Ortega’s report."
"Furthermore, although we used the Treaty as a reference – our reference was, of course, the Treaty – the agreement is in line with the draft Constitutional Treaty that was adopted by the Convention and which is being debated in the IGC."
"I would like to mention briefly that we have resolved some extremely important issues: the legislative planning, coordination of legislative work between the institutions; the Council informing Parliament on both the annual and the multiannual draft strategic programme; the presence of the Council in committees – in committees as well as in the House, of course – which I feel is important for the exchange of views necessary for Parliament’s work, the Commission commits to participate regularly in the work of the committees, preferably at ministerial level, but, in any case, at the highest level appropriate and at an accountable level."
"As regards transparency, there is confirmation of the importance of informing the public about the progress of legislative work, as the Convention recognised to some extent; the choice of form for legislative acts, which the Convention also includes in the proportionality principle, while the monopoly of the right of initiative conferred on the Commission – I want to make this clear to Parliament – cannot give it exclusive responsibility for the choice of form for a legislative act."
"Article 12 lays down that the Commission must take into account recommendations from the other institutions; with regard to co-regulation, on the most sensitive issue of call-back – to which Mrs Frassoni attaches great importance – I would point out that Parliament has already adopted the Wallis report to this end;"
"I believe that we have made great progress in this area, as well as in terms of self-regulation, control and giving economic operators and the social partners the possibility of adopting guidelines in this field; the issue of comitology, impact assessment, timeframes for implementation and transposal."
"I cannot dwell on this any further but I would like to say, in conclusion, that we made sure that the agreement did not jeopardise the future role of Parliament, as Mr Cox has told us at each stage."
"Not only have we not compromised Parliament’s role, but I believe that we have enhanced the European Parliament – and this is an important fact that remains in this term of office – as a legislative body in the interinstitutional balance of powers and in the interinstitutional agreement."
"– Mr President, better legislation is high on the European agenda."
"Legislation must improve and become more transparent, and that is a task for the Commission, Parliament and Member States alike."
"I believe that the interinstitutional agreement concluded in June is a sign that the Commission, Parliament and the Council are aware of this responsibility."
"Better legislation is essential for an internal market that functions at its best."
"Only if citizens and businesses are fully aware of their rights and duties can the internal market function well."
"European legislation must be readable and not cause any unnecessary red tape."
"If we as Europe want to become the world's most competitive economy, then we need to ensure at the very least that we can leave behind the unnecessary bureaucracy."
"It is therefore very gratifying that in 2002, the Commission published a whole series of documents that examine the possibilities of better legislation, but it is important that both the Council and Parliament should remain actively involved in achieving it."
"Improvements in legislation call for very concrete measures, and so I regret the somewhat vague wording in which the Commission has postulated its policy to improve European legislation."
"If the European Union does not want to be constantly faced with the need for improving its legislation, it is important for Community law to be given a thorough overhaul from here on in, to ensure that qualitatively sound legislation is introduced."
"A crucial element in the establishment of better legislation is the analysis of legislation for the financial and administrative implications by means of an impact assessment."
"Citizens and businesses are still being weighed down by a much too heavy administrative burden."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have called for the introduction of the business impact assessment for a long time."
"It is, however, important for this impact assessment to be carried out by an independent body."
"The impact assessment proposed by the Commission, which is to be carried out by the same officials who drafted the legislation, has already prompted me to refer to Baron von Münchhausen, who tried to drag himself out of the swamp by his own hair."
"As rapporteur for the European impact assessment, I will also certainly opt for an approach that tends towards an independent assessment."
"As well as establishing better legislation, it is at least equally important to determine the alternatives to legislation."
"Reducing the administrative burden also means placing more emphasis on the use of non-legislative instruments, such as agreements with social partners and self-regulating mechanisms."
"It is my conviction that these regulations have an important complementary character with regard to existing Community legislation."
"Apart from carefully examining alternatives for European legislation, it is also important for the implementation of legislation and national legislation by the Member States to be carried out more effectively and monitored closely."
"One remark to finish off; after this plenary debate, the Medina-Ortega Report will be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where it will be adapted to the interinstitutional agreement."
"I unreservedly endorse this course of action."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the desire of each and every party to defend its own position means that it is not an easy matter for Parliament, the Council and the Commission to set about rearranging their relationship."
"Nor is it easy for a parliament to express its willingness to surrender part of its legislative competence."
"It is relatively easy if this surrender is coupled with a call-back-position, that is, with the right of recall should it become apparent that the implementing or secondary legislation does not reflect the objectives and intentions of the legislator, that is, of Parliament."
"That is why we concentrated on this issue and the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, is one among the many who have pointed out its importance;"
"Mr Medina Ortega, too, has pointed out that, at the end of the day, the Members of this House are elected to pass laws."
"They are not elected to be spectators or observers at a trial, but to be legislators, and that is what the public expect us to do."
"We must, however, bear in mind that we do not possess the expert knowledge that some institutions or groups have, and such expertise needs to be used – by which I mean not only the giving of advice, but also having the opportunity to co-determine implementing legislation on the basis of laws passed by this House."
"I would like, though, to re-emphasise the importance of having the facility of right of recall, and that is something we have achieved."
"Much in the same way as with self-regulation, it was evident to us from the outset that we neither want nor are able to prevent it, but it must be clear that self-regulation must not nullify this House’s legislative competence, but, as Mrs Frassoni has made very clear, we must be firm in taking action to deal with any threat to curtail our legislative competence."
"At the end of the day, the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, is obliged to take appropriate action."
"Many other things are important, including improvements to the mutual information requirements, and to the information given to the European public."
"The Commission and the Council took it in turns to put up a great deal of resistance to Parliament’s demands in this area, especially where the call-back position is concerned, but we got our way in the end."
"The Commission and the Council had probably not reckoned on what I might call an unbeatable team working on this, chaired by Mr Gargani, whose composure was impregnable; Mr Clegg, whose actions were characterised by British reserve, but were nonetheless effective; and Mrs Frassoni, whose combination of toughness and charm was vital in softening up somewhat the Vice-Presidents of the Commission, something that we know is not exactly easy."
"That being so, I believe that we have come up with a very good solution."
"I recommend that the House bear this in mind and adopt the Frassoni report accordingly."
"Mr President, as was mentioned before, this is indeed a welcome agreement."
"I much enjoyed working with my colleagues, Mr Gargani, Ms Frassoni, Mr Swoboda and other colleagues in the Council and Parliament, even though it was a painfully protracted process."
"We arrived at an agreement which is a lot better than many of us expected at the beginning."
"As has been said by a number of speakers, it is not a perfect agreement."
"No agreement is perfect."
"It is a bit of a mixed bag."
"As Monica Frassoni said, there is a bit of 'blah blah'; there are some slightly vacuous passages, but there are also some incredibly important procedural advances."
"For a minute or two I should like to focus, if I may, on what happens next."
"There is no point in reaching this agreement on paper after all these months of protracted talks if we do not transform the advances we agreed upon into a practical effect as soon as possible."
"I should like to emphasise two aspects where I think we need to look for follow-up as soon as possible."
"Firstly, paragraph 36 of the agreement says that 'within six months of the date upon which this Agreement comes into force, the European Parliament and the Council, whose task it would be as legislative authority to adopt at the final stage the proposals for simplified acts, need to modify their working methods by introducing, for example, ad hoc structures with the specific task of simplifying legislation.'"
"That is a very important objective and it will be quite tricky to achieve."
"I urge both Parliament and our colleagues in the Council to make sure that the deadline of achieving the process of simplification is indeed met within the six months specified here."
"I should also like to refer you to paragraph 30."
"It deals with something that everyone knows is close to my heart, which is the advance I hope we will make in conducting impact assessments across all three institutions."
"The text says 'As soon as possible after this Agreement is adopted, the three Institutions will carry out an assessment of their respective experiences and will consider the possibility of establishing a common methodology'."
"Monica Frassoni's commentary on this agreement is absolutely outstanding in its clarity and fairness except in one respect, where I think she is a little negative about the potential of reaching agreement on impact assessments."
"My own feeling is that there is simply no way that we will achieve the general principles referred to in the common objectives in the agreement - namely legal certainty, the promotion of simplicity, clarity and consistency in the drafting of laws - if we do not make rapid progress – as called for in paragraph 25 – in establishing a common methodology to have environmental, social and economic impact assessments, not only attached to draft proposals from the Commission, but also in significant amendments tabled by ourselves and by the Council of Ministers."
"I hope that there will be some sense of urgency over the next few months to achieve real, practical progress on the back of the agreement, and especially on these two important objectives of simplification and impact assessments."
"Mr President, I want to pay a compliment to the four speakers before me in the debate who took part in the negotiations on this interinstitutional agreement and particularly to commend, as Nick Clegg did, Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement to the House."
"However, I want to slightly disagree with some of the points that have just been made."
"When we talk about better legislation, it seems to me that suddenly there descends upon this 21st Century parliament the feel that the late-18th Century Beccaria and Bentham walk the stage with us."
"Legislation is a science which can be improved, because we all know what the good of the human condition is and all we have to do is devise technical means to achieve it."
"We know, as Mr Medina Ortega has just said, that this is not, in fact, the case."
"The duties of the members of a democratic legislature are not to seek a single institutional view."
"The judges of the members of a democratic legislature are to address the dialectic of contemporary politics, to express the points upon which we disagree and not the points upon which we agree."
"Out of disagreement or debate comes perhaps, in the end, wisdom and decision, but we do not start out on the assumption that there is one right answer and it is a technical question of how to achieve it."
"Nor can we reasonably start out from the assumption that impact assessment is easy."
"We have 'legislation missiles' which make impact as they land and through that we can tell what the impact is."
"Everybody who has studied the sociology of law is well aware that this is not true."
"What legislation has actually brought about remains controversial for years after it has been passed."
"There are many strands in the effects of legislation."
"We do not even always agree on the juridical impact, far less the economic impact of legislation."
"A week or so ago, we had a huge argument about the Copyright Directive because people were not sure, not about the cost, but what it would actually mean in its implications before the courts of law."
"Legal certainty is a myth and an illusion."
"The most that good legislators can do is diminish legal uncertainty and we should approach our task with due modesty in that regard."
"That brings me back to the point about subsidiarity which matters to us all greatly."
"Impact assessment taken on the grand scale seems to suppose that all law impacts equally and in the same way on all parts of this vast and diverse Union."
"What an absurd view."
"It is not true."
"Every time you look at a real case, you find that it impacts differently in different places."
"This is what makes subsidiarity so important."
"I strongly commend Monica Frassoni's report and its explanatory statement."
"I shall vote for it, but I express some doubts about the underlying suppositions of this debate."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one theme of our joint debate today is a very important one, the quality of European lawmaking."
"One improvement to it is to be in the form of an institutional agreement between the three institutions; as for the other, the Commission, starting with the White Paper ‘European Governance’ at the end of 2001, has produced to date no fewer than sixteen comprehensive documents in the form of communications and reports on ‘European Governance and better lawmaking’."
"Some of these documents constitute a sort of undertaking on the part of the Commission in respect of its own work, and that is laudable."
"Others touch directly on Parliament’s rights as laid down in the Treaties, such as, for example, the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, termed comitology procedures, or statements on the creation of new legal instruments, such as, for example, open coordination, self-regulation, co-regulation and similar."
"The new interinstitutional agreement is meant to be a sort of undertaking on the part of the three institutions to lay down the use of these instruments, which has never before been specified in any of the Treaties."
"Although our counterparts have done important work, and despite my gratitude to them for doing so and thus enabling themselves to really get to grips with these issues, I have to say that I am less happy about our entering into another obligation, as anyone reading the text of this interinstitutional agreement could only wonder what added value would thereby accrue to Parliament over and above its rights as laid down in the Treaties."
"I do not think that will amount to very much; worse still, by signing up to this agreement only a few days after the ceremonial opening of the IGC, which will also deal with this topic, and without being constrained to do so, we in this House are binding ourselves in chains and, indeed, renouncing the full use of the parliamentary prerogatives that it has taken two laborious decades to secure for ourselves."
"The only way Parliament has, in the past, been able to progressively extend its influence in the teeth of the Commission and the Council has been by making the utmost use of the rights accorded it by the Treaties."
"By signing up to interinstitutional agreements of this sort and concluding agreements with the Commission, as we did with the Lamfalussy procedure, we are ourselves again curtailing our own rights, thus, as I see it, putting everything completely the wrong way around."
"The quality of European lawmaking is so important an issue that we should not treat it lightly."
"Those on the receiving end – by which I mean the public to whom legislation applies, the Member States, which have to transpose it and all involved in implementing it at every level – suffer when laws are bad, and so we should stop churning out loads of paper through all the institutions and instead put it to the test by submitting and enacting laws that really are better."
"That is in our hands as Members of this House."
"Today, the eighth day of October, sees this House, by means of the Medina Ortega report, making a second attempt at stating its position on a Commission communication on simplified and improved regulation dating back to December 2001, since which date, three summit meetings of Heads of State or Government have given their attention to the issue without Parliament having been in a position to respond and thereby make its influence felt."
"Producing more paper in this way sets a bad example, when we should, instead, be supporting the Commission in reducing the amount of EU legislation, which now amounts to some 97 000 pages, and in cleaning it all up."
"That, too, would help the quality of European legislation."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Medina Ortega."
"For me, better legislation means European governance that is more democratic, achieves more for its citizens and becomes more comprehensible for everyone – a more efficient, more democratic, more transparent Europe."
"That was the Convention’s key objective in drafting the constitution."
"Some Heads of Government were at risk this weekend of slipping back into their old power and money games, thereby, in actual fact, overlooking what the European public actually wants."
"Fortunately, we are able – and this is also topic of discussion here – to do a great deal within the parameters of the European Treaties."
"In the White Paper on ‘European governance’, the Commission has tabled a large number of proposals for better governance, of which improvements in the legislative process formed an important part."
"This is an area in which we have made some real progress."
"The Commission has meanwhile tabled various proposals in this framework, including the programme for consolidation, codification and simplification of legislation, which will reduce the volume of legislation by no fewer than 35 000 pages."
"This should, for a change, get a mention in the papers."
"In the area of legislation, however, the co-legislators – Parliament and the Council – should be given a central role."
"The Commission made an unfortunate start, but later decided on an agreement with Parliament and the Council, which culminated in the interinstitutional agreement."
"It gives plenty of scope for a swifter, simpler European approach in areas such as environment and social policy."
"If, however, the results are not satisfactory, Parliament can intervene and claim, and indeed exercise, its right as co-legislator."
"In my view, the Commission and the Council have been far too slow to concede this, and they are still showing far too little generosity."
"After all, there is no real democracy without Parliament."
"Nobody needs a technocratic power governing above and without the European people."
"What we do need is a drastic approach to tackle excessively lengthy procedures, the lack of results and the overall transparency deficit."
"In this House, Mr van Doorn tabled a proposal for a bureaucracy test of some kind, an independent assessment."
"I rather like the concept, provided that the information we gain from this eventually ends up with us as co-legislators."
"In the final analysis, decisions must, of course, be taken by us in unison, together with the Council, and that is, of course, at the heart of the struggle we are having here, so I hope that the Commission is prepared to deliver on the agreements."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we are moving forward in terms of better lawmaking."
"As a pro-European I find it extremely frustrating that we bring forward legislation in this place that is not properly thought through and that not only damages this Parliament: it also damages our credibility."
"We also need to look at current legislation to see whether it is being implemented across each Member State."
"If it is not being implemented, is this because it is unworkable?"
"If it is unworkable, why do we not just repeal that legislation, instead of simply bringing forward further legislation in the same field, as we appear to do at the moment."
"We also have to look at whether it is really necessary at European level in all cases."
"If it is necessary then we have to go for comprehensive impact assessment, based on up-to-date scientific and medical evidence in some areas where it is applicable, such as health and safety legislation in the employment and social affairs field."
"We must also take into account the situation in each Member State."
"The accuracy of impact assessments really must be improved – I must say that I do not believe that they are very good at the moment."
"They must also be available at a very early stage so that we can have genuine consultation."
"That consultation should include the actual instrument which is most appropriate for that specific subject area."
"All the outcomes and all the contributions should be put into the public domain."
"I am very pleased that Mr Medina Ortega has agreed to refer back his motion."
"It is right that he should do that."
"I congratulate him on all the work that he has done but his motion has, of course, been superseded by the interinstitutional agreement."
"Mr President, I largely support the reports before us on better regulation and the interinstitutional agreement, and indeed their objectives: to secure a reliable, up-to-date and user-friendly body of law to benefit all our citizens, workers and businesses."
"This will involve removing the 'dead wood' – the obsolete or outdated texts – which should result in decreasing the volume of the without affecting legal status."
"There is a need to improve presentation and ensure user-friendly access to a Community body of law, the modernisation and simplification of existing legislation and policies have to be phased in."
"However, the task should not be underestimated."
"The Single Market is one of our great success stories, but the sheer volume of legislation spawned by the Single Market to ensure harmonisation of Member State procedures is daunting."
"Amendments, originating in any of the official languages and then translated into all of the others, often leave the finished product – when it is translated back into all of the official languages – turgid, pedantic and generally cumbersome and uncomfortable to the native eye."
"Yes, the legal status is intact, but the text is not user-friendly."
"Our addiction to acronyms has spawned a new language: Eurospeak."
"After six months in any of the Institutions, we are all using it, further isolating ourselves and our work from 'Joe and Mary Citizen'."
"Cocobu, CFSP – or is it PESC? – Coreper, and the latest is GARC, which I think stands for the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"In short, our texts need urgent detoxification from this addiction."
"Impact assessment is a particular area of current interest for my country, Ireland."
"Our specific interest is in developing a means of competitiveness-proofing for EU legislative measures, to ensure that the EU strategy is one that stimulates economic growth in order to meet the Lisbon 2010 objectives."
"We would like to achieve real progress in the development and use of impact assessment to underpin competitiveness."
"The text of paragraph 30 of the interinstitutional agreement is inspired by the proposal in Mr Medina Ortega's report to have the possibility of impact assessments on codecision legislation, prior to the adoption of any substantive amendment, either at first reading or at the conciliation stage on the basis of jointly-defined criteria and procedures."
"I will not hold my breath, Mr President."
"For the record, the Commission's own integrated impact assessment procedure is in its infancy."
"For 2003, the Commission identified 44 proposals for so-called extended impact assessment."
"It seems however, that only four were completed."
"I should like the Commission to comment on this, please."
"The expected legislative proposals on chemicals not included in the 44 originally identified, but assessed now in response to political and other pressure, will be the first real, extensive impact assessment carried out on a draft proposal."
"Only then perhaps will its usefulness become apparent."
"In conclusion, to use the Commissioner's own words, there is a solid basis here, but perhaps it is a wish-list."
"Let us hope it is the former."
"Mr President, as we all know, the Commission has been preoccupied with the question of better governance of this Community model which is called the European Union for years now."
"Part of this strategy is to simplify and improve law-making."
"These issues have been monitored for a long time by the rapporteur, Mr Medina Ortega, which is why his rich experience of the lacunae, malfunctions and weaknesses in law-making are crystallised in his report."
"His proposals cover all stages of law-making, from the preparatory work for legislation, the drafting procedures and how the content is worded, to the stage in which legislation is applied by the Member States."
"As time is short, I shall comment on three of the basic overall problems which arise."
"The first is of a purely political nature and concerns the permanent clash between the bureaucracy of each administrative mechanism and, consequently, between the corresponding mechanism of the European Commission, which considers that efficiency is a technical matter, thus undermining the principle of democratic legitimacy, which is the only principle which can lend credibility to any legislative text."
"If, therefore, we want real reform in law-making, the Commission will need to take suitable initiatives and to set an example which will give absolute priority to democratic legitimacy and to safeguarding the balance between the institutions."
"Secondly, from the moment when particular importance is attached, and rightly so in my opinion, to the quality and transparency of the numerous consultations needed to promote a legislative proposal, the minimum consultation specifications proposed should include the representativeness of the social agencies participating by setting strict criteria of representativeness and the procedure for regular revision of the list of representative organisations."
"Representativeness is not a vested right of any agency and must be confirmed gradually."
"And finally, the Commission communication, which quite rightly makes proposals on improving how legislative texts are incorporated in the Member States but which, although there are also proposals in the reports relating to the application of the law, does not take account of these proposals."
"If it at least respected democratic legitimacy, it should be consulting Parliament on why it is not taking account of these proposals."
"Mr President, as colleagues have already commented this evening, these are very important reports because lawmaking is arguably the most important part of government and it defines, in many ways, the fundamental character of any system of governance."
"I have been in and out of this Parliament now for almost 15 years, and throughout that period there have been reports about the subject matter that we are discussing this evening."
"What I am not sure about is whether, over that period, legislation has improved or worsened."
"But I am sure that there is much more political interest in, and debate about, this subject now than there was in my earlier days."
"That, I am sure, is something of a move in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, the proof of the pudding is in the eating - as we say in Britain."
"It is not what the Commission, or the Council, or the Parliament that matters: it is what we that counts."
"What, therefore, are the crucial points?"
"The first is, of course, democracy."
"All procedures for government, whether administration or legislation, must be underpinned by the ballot box."
"Those who take decisions in these areas must be answerable and accountable for what they do."
"Finally, the systems in which they work must be transparent."
"Secondly, all this must take place in the framework of a rule of law."
"Where abuse occurs, there must be available legal redress administered by an independent judiciary."
"This can take place in a whole variety of areas: whether there is a failure to transpose, or whether something takes place as a result of improper procedures."
"To pick up on a point that Mr Medina Ortega made, the areas where self-regulation is in place must in turn operate under the rule of law."
"Thirdly, there is that frequently banded-about word ‘subsidiarity’."
"We should not be doing at European level what should in fact be done at a national level, however exactly you define that."
"Fourthly there is proportionality."
"Any legislation that we draw up must be proportionate to the abuse or the mischief which it is intended to address."
"In this context, while I commend the proposals of the Mandelkern Report, we must be careful that the impact assessments do not themselves turn into an additional bureaucratic hurdle in the legislative process."
"Finally, of course, there is a need for clarity."
"All I can say is, as an Englishman, that an awful lot of the English that is produced in Brussels is not recognised as such by my fellow countrymen."
"We should lead by example."
"Do we actually improve legislation as it passes through this House?"
"I think the truthful answer is that ‘sometimes we do’, when in fact the answer should be ‘always’."
"We should begin by putting our own house in order."
"Mr President, there are many aspects to this debate: better drafting, wider consultation and so on, and we are making progress on a number of these."
"However, the issue I would like to address is what I would call 'horizontal subsidiarity', it is not vertical subsidiarity that Lord Inglewood just addressed in his comments about the level of government - European, national or regional."
"It is about whether or not you should legislate, whether you should leave it to self-regulation, co-regulation or no regulation at all."
"There too we need a hierarchy; we need an onus to prove the need to intervene."
"It may be that you do not need to regulate in certain matters or on certain subjects."
"If you do, it may be that self-regulation is enough, and if that is not enough, that co-regulation is enough."
"However, when it is not enough – and only when it is not enough – then we should intervene and adopt legislation."
"The question is, as with vertical subsidiarity, who decides?"
"It is right that the legislative authority should decide."
"Those who are accountable to the population as a whole, rather than to certain sectoral interests, should take that decision in the first place."
"That is why I welcome the interinstitutional agreement and the Frassoni report – and I congratulate Mrs Frassoni on her report."
"This interinstitutional agreement does not contain an enormous amount, but it does contain recognition that to co-regulate you first need authorisation from the legislative authority."
"That is a very important principle and is something we have achieved in this interinstitutional agreement."
"I should just like to add a word about interinstitutional agreements in general."
"We now have a large number of them, many of them overlap, some repeat the same subjects using different wording."
"We will soon have to come back and codify and simplify the various interinstitutional agreements that we have into a single, clear, concise text."
"It is one of the first things we should return to once we have settled the issue, hopefully soon, of adopting our new European Constitution."
"Mr President, I also welcome the fact that we have now reached the point with this inter-institutional agreement that we can begin to make good on our commitment to deliver better and simpler legislation."
"I would also like to congratulate the team of negotiators and indeed our rapporteurs."
"If we get it right, good clear simple legislation could mean fewer infringement cases in the European Court of Justice, it could also result in laws which are easier to enforce in our Member States."
"I believe that consumers and citizens need to know what redress they can expect from EU law, and businesses need to be clear about standards and practices they must aspire to, in order to implement EU law."
"Yes, regulatory impact assessments may be a technical tool, but they are a vital tool in both involving more stake-holders and providing for checks and balances on the executive, improving both the quality of debate in this House and our ability to call the executive to account."
"We can also use impact assessments to evaluate the benefits of proposed legislation and equally to look at where co-regulation, self-regulation or soft- law can be useful tools."
"I know some of my colleagues are concerned that soft-law options would undermine or take away Parliaments prerogative as a legislator."
"I accept that there are cultural differences between Member States on this issue, but we also have to accept that sometimes legislation can be inflexible and difficult to change whereas codes of conduct can have effect more quickly, particularly in unfair business practices."
"Of course, Mr MacCormick is right that legislation is about politics."
"It is not just a scientific exercise of impact assessments."
"For that reason this Parliament and its elected politicians will always be an essential part of the legislative process."
"I also agree that callback is an essential part of that right of scrutiny."
"We should give our support to the better legislation agenda but Parliament will need more resources and powers to be able to respond to and evaluate impact assessments and use these regulatory procedures to call Commission and Council to account."
"The better regulation agenda will require a change of culture, power and responsibility in all our institutions."
"It should not be to the detriment of Parliament; in fact it should strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of future legislation."
"Mr President, I asked to speak again after the debate because I was very interested in hearing what the Council and the Commission had to say."
"Now I have heard them, and their speeches have confirmed for me that, if we want this agreement not to remain an empty vision, then it will depend exclusively on the European Parliament’s ability to ensure that it is respected and that it enters into the practice of our institution."
"During this debate, exactly as was the case during the negotiations, we encountered a certain inflexibility on the need to ensure that, where alternative methods to legislation are concerned, there should be a legislator and, for the European Parliament, in particular, the possibility of evaluating how they work and if necessary, of rejecting them."
"Mrs McCarthy, the problem is not the cultural difference, which can certainly exist between us regarding voluntary agreements; the problem lies in the fact that, when the voluntary agreements do not work, then we must, as the legislative authority, have the right to recall them, and this, I am sorry to say, is partially possible but only if we fight long and hard to get it."
"Mr President, I would like to speak briefly about the issue of impact assessment."
"Mr Clegg, who was part of our negotiating team, is right: at a certain point, we stopped insisting on this issue, not least because Parliament may well not yet be ready to act united on this question."
"Impact assessment remains, I would stress, a highly political issue, on which we even risked losing some of our prerogatives during the negotiations, binding ourselves too rigidly to an obligation to complete an impact assessment which, in practice, we are still not technically in a position to do."
"Furthermore, I believe that the Commission’s approach to this issue varies enormously."
"For some matters, indeed, the assessment is carried out and is seen as important, whilst for other matters it is completely abandoned."
"In relation to this, I would like to give the example of the famous Van Miert list on trans-European networks, where the Commission has completely abandoned the idea of any type of impact assessment for this important measure."
"I repeat: impact assessment remains an issue that this interinstitutional agreement has not succeeded in closing, and I think that we must be aware of this act responsibly for the future."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I should just like to say that the procedure whereby the rapporteur comes back again and replies at the end of the debate is an excellent innovation."
"I congratulate you and Mrs Frassoni for organising the previous debate in this way."
"I found the agenda already prepared, so I will communicate your congratulations to the person who deserves them."
"Thank you very much, Mr Corbett."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0294/2003) by Mr Bodrato, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Green Paper on European space policy (COM(2003) 17 - C5-0209/2003 - 2003/2092(INI))."
"Mr President, the Green Paper presented by Commissoner Busquin, which Parliament particularly welcomed, once again put forward the strategic importance of space policy for the independence, safety and economic growth of a Europe that wants to remain at the forefront of scientific research and technological innovation."
"In recent months, a turning point was reached with the constitutional Convention, which gave space policy a specific role, thus representing a legal base for Community programmes and consolidating the strategy begun with the extraordinary success of the Galileo programme."
"Nevertheless, we must not disregard the fact that the Commission has also given a specific response to the unprecedented crisis that has struck the space sector, specifically launchers, undermining the activity of many industries and accentuating distortions of the world market."
"The space assetis crucial to the concentration of professional expertise, research and technology, which characterise the development of the knowledge-based economy."
"It is a resource that cannot be wasted and the Commission and the European Space Agency Council have shown that they are fully aware of this."
"Parliament’s report stresses the role of the ESA and national agencies, and expresses its satisfaction with the framework agreement, which the European Community and the ESA supported and Parliament strongly pressed for."
"This framework agreement confirms the unique role of the ESA in organising research and technological and industrial development."
"This role must be specified in a European space programme that redefines the responsibilities of the Commission in the face of public demand and new initiatives that call for political representativeness and a specific institutional competence."
"Giving Europe a role as leader on the international stage, involving all the EU countries is not incompatible with the firm belief that international cooperation is necessary: cooperation, in the first instance, with the United States – thinking here of the International Space station – but also with other countries, including Russia, Japan and China itself."
"We must, however, be aware that the quality of international agreements – in particular those relating to space – depends on the quality of scientific, industrial and also financial support."
"Europe’s goals have to be supported by public resources, as is the case across the world, and by more active organisation of common policies in fields such as agriculture, telecommunications, the environment and transport."
"We need to give stimulus to private initiatives, as is the case with Galileo, but we need to take note that the objective of doubling the space budget in ten years will only go part way towards bridging the gap with the United States."
"Space science has played a pioneering role."
"The quality of human resources and basic research, however, warrants greater attention."
"The future of the European Space policy depends on this being given."
"This is why we believe that the next framework programme for research should dedicate more funding to the space sector, guaranteeing a quota in this field for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are becoming an indispensable support for new innovative enterprises."
"My final point concerns the Convention’s guideline for an arms agency that is open to all the Member States, according to the structured cooperation method."
"This guideline can help to implement the industrial and technological asset."
"This is not – and we need to make this clear – about militarising space, but rather about recognising that this is about twofold activities, both military and civil, as well as a strategy for European security that cannot be abandoned because of the temptations of US unilateralism."
"To avoid misinterpretations, the report refers to the United Nations resolution on prevention of an arms race in outer space and to the Convention itself, which proposes to promote peace and to contribute to security and sustainable development on earth."
"We are now looking forward to the White Paper, after discussing the Green Paper."
"Our expectations are based on the positive opinions that we have expressed thus far and they are, we believe, the expectations of the scientific world and the European industrial world too."
". – Mr President, Mr Bodrato, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to thank Mr Bodrato and the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for the quality of their report and for their constructive proposals."
"This once again demonstrates Parliament’s commitment to and support of space."
"The consultation on the Green Paper provided the opportunity for a very open debate on the future of space exploration in Europe and to examine many contributions from all sectors."
"On this basis, we are now committed to preparing the White Paper on the medium and long-term objectives for European Space policy, as Parliament asked of the Commission in January 2002."
"Some crucial points of convergence have materialised."
"The first is that Europe needs a high-level space policy that is independent and ongoing."
"The second point is the acknowledgement that our space industry is structurally vulnerable."
"As you have pointed out, we did have problems where launchers are concerned, and a decision by the ESA Council helped us to find a solution, albeit one which will only be useful in the short- and medium-term."
"We must now find a more structural solution."
"Lastly, it is crucial that we take a closer interest in the space telecommunications sector in order to increase demand and to maintain skills in our industry."
"My third and last point concerns the European Union’s new responsibilities in space-related matters."
"In the Union’s new political context, the approaches of the European Space Agency and of the national space agencies must be combined into a joint vision that will create a genuine space policy at European level."
"To this end, I welcome the agreement reached between the ESA and the EU at the Council of 22 September: this is a crucial step."
"By the same token, a space policy must be a horizontal Union policy, which serves other policies too."
"It would set out strategy and would contain the guidelines that would help to ensure a coherent European space effort."
"It should cover not only the civilian domain but also aspects of security and defence."
"Formulating such a policy would, of course, require a clear legal base in the future Treaty and this is the intention of the Convention proposal seeking to grant the Union competences in the domain of space that it would share with the Member States."
"The Commission, like Parliament, hopes that this proposal will be accepted without amendment at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"– Mr President, I am obliged to Mr Busquin, who knows that I have for a number of years had a particular interest in Galileo, which has become very dear to me."
"Yet I am constantly being asked what Europe is really looking for in space, and why Europe should spend money on space when there are other problems on Earth that are so pressing and in need of high levels of funding."
"So, although I do not expect this issue to meet with either rejoicing or unqualified approval, my firm conviction, which I know to be shared by many of my fellow-MEPs, is that space is of strategic importance for Europe and for the European economy."
"Thanks to new technologies, it provides new opportunities."
"It provides jobs for our engineers and prospects for the future."
"Europe must not be satisfied with technological achievements that are less than first-class, and Europe is capable of them."
"It is a matter of fact rather than a secret that space policy is one of the core issues for the twenty-first century."
"Our everyday lives are already being shaped by the most varied applications made possible by space and the satellites we have put into it, behind which lies technological know-how that needs to be nurtured."
"We, in Europe, have valuable resources, by which I mean not only engineers and technicians, but also research establishments and enterprises."
"These give rise to innovations, but, as I keep being told, and as I have heard this afternoon, researchers and brainpower go where more is on offer, not only financially, but also in terms of technology."
"That, Commissioner Busquin, is why I believe there to be an urgent need for real efforts to be made towards a coherent European space policy, as you have so aptly described it."
"Europe must become aware of where it stands and of what opportunities it has."
"No longer must we make declarations; now is the time for us to at last take action."
"Europe must also be willing to invest, and, while there is no doubt that this can sometimes be a painful business, the space sector is not only highly cost-intensive, but also highly competitive."
"Let us then take up this challenge!"
"Without decisiveness and commitment, Europe will lose independent access to space, and will also lose out when it comes to the applications resulting from it."
"Commissioner Busquin, I share your view of the dangers of dependence on others, and so I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper on European space policy and Mr Bodrato’s detailed and stimulating report."
"Europe needs a political signal to begin a new chapter in space travel, and I hope that we will, by a clear resolution tomorrow, help to give European space travel the right impetus!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guido Bodrato, for the remarkable work he has done and for the ability he has demonstrated to listen to divergent opinions and to reconcile them."
"I believe that this is an altogether remarkable document."
"This report is particularly exciting because it comes at the end of what has been a historical period for space, thanks in particular to the crucial boost given by Mr Philippe Busquin and his staff."
"Indeed, for the first time, Europe is outlining something other than a policy to regulate competition and the internal market."
"It is drawing up a genuinely proactive industrial and technological policy which I hope will reassure all those who sometimes doubt whether Europe provides any real benefit."
"Europe has achieved these results firstly through Galileo, which has given us the opportunity to create the first European mixed investment company, in other words, a joint company that will support an industrial and technological project."
"It has also done so by laying the foundations, with the help of the Green Paper, of a space policy that acknowledges that space is a major technology by dint of the importance of its applications in all spheres, including the civilian; a policy that acknowledges the need for proactive political support; a policy that recognises the need to uphold our independence with regard to the emerging powers."
"This is a point of which Commissioner Busquin has reminded us and one that we feel is extremely important. At the same time, we must remain open to the world because, in the background, extremely fruitful cooperation is taking place with the USA, with Russia, over the Soyuz system at Kourou and with China over Galileo."
"In other words, space is entering a new era: an era of growing influence for the European Union as a space power that can act completely independently of the world’s superpowers against the backdrop of a crisis, in particular the crisis besetting public budgets."
"We now need to follow the direction set out in the White Paper."
"I personally hope that relations between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Union improve."
"We need the ESA and its skills, but we also need the Union and its political support if we are going to be able to speak with a single voice in the first division."
"I also wish to see institutional consolidation within the Commission."
"Because the Treaty provides for space competence to be shared at European level, the Commission will have to ensure that full use is made of this competence."
"In this regard, I wish to express my attachment to the framework programmes for research and development and for the ‘aeronautical-space line’, which appears for the first time in the sixth FPRD."
"I am also committed to developing a culture of programmes and the capacity to launch sectoral European programmes through the other Commission services."
"Having said that, I am thinking in particular of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) for the environment and of the follow-ups to Lisbon for education."
"In other words, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Busquin and Mr Bodrato and say that this is a fine example of a dossier in which Europe can do most when it moves ahead with political will."
"I offer my best wishes for success and continuity for what we have managed to achieve together in the five years of our mandate."
"Mr President, I welcome the publication of the Commission Green Paper on European space policy in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA)."
"In my view, this Green Paper demonstrates an awareness of the importance for Europe of developing the space sector in industrial, strategic and also political terms."
"Last May, we held a debate on the future of this sector, in light of a serious crisis related to fierce world competition and to funding problems."
"The Green Paper, the Bodrato report and the newly announced White Paper contain practical proposals that could ultimately help us to overcome this crisis and finally add some real ambition to an independent European space policy."
"To this end, I welcome the outcome of the Galileo programme and I share the stated desire to develop Community integration."
"I do hope, however, that this integration will not call into question the independent competences of the space agency in its role as programme coordinator and leader."
"I should like to address two issues."
"The report insists on the need to create synergies between civilian and military activities – I heard Mr Bodrato’s words quite clearly – whilst advocating the use of space for peaceful purposes, which I support."
"He hopes that the satellite systems will benefit not only transport and the environment, but also security, so that Europe has its own strategy, management body and its own resources."
"All well and good, but I am convinced that priority should be given to the use of space for peaceful purposes: the needs are enormous, whether we are talking about the environment or about risk management."
"Europe must not fall in line with the US model, which gives priority to research and development in the military sphere above any potential civilian applications."
"Lastly, one crucial aspect of an ambitious European space policy concerns funding."
"The report emphasises that the provision of public funds is crucial to the development of space programmes."
"There is a major contradiction between the Union’s stated aims and reality."
"There has been no increase in the budgets allocated to Europe’s space agencies, whereas the US dedicates six times more public funds to space than do all the European countries put together."
"The Union must, as a matter of urgency, release funding that matches the ambitions it has stated."
"This is also a requirement for Community integration and, as I see it, only public funds can guarantee long-term investment, which is crucial in the space industry, as is maintaining high-level skills."
"This is a prerequisite for an independent, dynamic European space policy that uses cutting-edge technology and which creates high-quality jobs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, European space policy is becoming the spearhead of European policy as a whole, due to the hopes it engenders for cutting-edge research, for the new technologies, for the economy and for development."
"It must be realistic; in other words, it must make sense in the context of US and Russian space policy and act as a driving force for the European Union."
"I congratulate Mr Bodrato on his report, which has the merit of expressing this desire."
"We feel, however, that it focuses too much on military applications, which are not the intended aim of this policy."
"This is why we are proposing Galileo, which will be a purely civilian organisation, as opposed to the USA’s GPS system or the Russian Glonass, which are under military control."
"We propose to support Article 150 of the Convention under discussion, so that space forms part of European policy as a whole."
"A joint organisation must be set up at European level and the European Space Agency (ESA) must be more a tool of this integrated policy than an intergovernmental body."
"Work in the space sector must form part of the context of the European research area and the bulk of resources allocated to this field should be shared by the Union’s Member States."
"All players involved in space policy and in particular the European Parliament which supports our space policy must sit down at the same table."
"Our group will set great store by these proposals and will pay close attention when the White Paper on space, which is due to be submitted to us by the end of the year, is adopted."
"Thank you very much, Mr Piétrasanta."
"The next item is the report (A5-0294/2003) by Mr Guido Bodrato, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on European space policy."
"– Mr President, we have had many discussions on space travel before, and I am glad that the subject is now accorded much greater importance in European debate than was the case ten years ago."
"I might add, with all modesty, that this House can take the credit for this."
"We grasped the strategic significance of space, but also the fact that very little money is to be made from it, so that means that space travel needs to be supported by public funds, but what will certainly show a profit in the years to come will be the activities derived from space travel in the fields of telecommunications, measuring techniques, and so on, which we have often discussed."
"There is no future for space travel, though, without carriers in the form of satellites, if – let me add – there is no manned spaceflight."
"In Cologne, there is now a centre providing training for astronauts."
"Our disagreements are in fact not so much about the purpose of space travel – about which I believe there to be broad consensus – as about its military aspects, which are a new factor."
"Let me say that I do not think that we should shy away from this issue, as – in contrast to ten or twenty years ago – Europe now has its Foreign and Security Policy."
"We cannot separate one from the other."
"I will admit that I find learning rather difficult, but one is never too old to learn more, and so I would very much urge that particular attention be given to this aspect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, few but honourable Members, however important the development of the space policy of the European Union is, its orientation is equally important."
"Despite the initial proclamations about the use of space for peaceful purposes in the direction of development, knowledge and applications, direct or indirect references to military use have been multiplying recently, to the point at which it is clear that it is this use that mainly interests the European Union."
"This orientation is also clear from the European Commission's Green Paper and from the STAR 21 report and from the meeting organised by the Greek Presidency in Athens on 8 and 9 May on the subject of ‘Security and Defence Aspects of Space’."
"Militarisation is being promoted both in order to serve what we see as the aggressive common defence and security policy and on the pretext that it is the only way to strengthen the aerospace industry with public funding."
"Admittedly, this industry is under intense pressure from its competitors."
"Perhaps, however, its problems originate in the promotion of corporate profit as the driving force, in liberalism, competitiveness and the free market which prohibit non-military public aid?"
"Although the report by the Committee on Industry which we are examining contains a series of correct findings and proposals, such as acknowledging the role of the European Space Agency, the reference to the need to promote research and international cooperation, however, adopts the military use of space and goes too far."
"Thus, not only does it praise the proposal to set up a European Agency for Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities, but it goes as far as reiterating ‘the valuable role which the military use of satellite systems can play in peacekeeping operations’."
"What peacekeeping operations does it mean?"
"Perhaps the continuing murderous attacks against Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq?"
"The involvement of the European Union in the further militarisation of space is a severe blow for peace because it brings it to the same level of responsibilities as the United States in the military competition race."
"Finally, it would be a very negative development for science and the peoples if the European Space Agency which, as a transnational organisation at the level of the European continent makes a huge contribution to the development of space science and research, were to become the agency of those pursuing military objectives."
"For these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I call on you not to strengthen this move."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that in the fast process of globalisation which humanity is experiencing – a process which also shrinks the horizon of our world by seeking a universal cosmic and interplanetary dimension – it is strategically important for our Union to have an advanced space policy."
"I therefore totally support the decisions which have been taken by the European Council in Lisbon in this respect, the comments and proposals of the Commission since 1999 and the parallel decisions of the intergovernmental European Space Agency."
"I also support the proposal in Article 50 which the Convention has produced in order to provide a legal basis for Community actions."
"As in other sectors, Europe must have the necessary ambition and impetus, reflected in its budgets, to be able to play a leading role on the international stage."
"It must have independent access to space and develop suitable technologies."
"And it must do so within a system of international cooperation, particularly with the United States and with Russia, who are pioneers in terms of space, and also with others such as Japan, China, etc. But that cooperation cannot be subordinate."
"Under no circumstances must it be subordinate."
"In this regard, I am happy with the progress made in one area of our space policy, the Galileo project, and the agreements which ensure its interoperability with the American GPS system, and I hope that we will soon reach agreements with the Russian Glonass system as well."
"I trust that those agreements do not subordinate the civilian use of our Galileo system to military priorities which cause occasional shadowing of the signal and which are not subject to the control of the people responsible for European security and certainly do not require the consent of these decision-makers."
"Mutual collaboration, yes, but subordination, no."
"I would like to end by congratulating Mr Bodrato on the fine report he has presented to us on European space policy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, space is essential for European competitiveness."
"It is vital that our continent should also be able to develop and produce new technology."
"European innovations and different components cannot be left out of the market in any possible competitive situation because of trade and other barriers."
"The rapid development of telecommunications means Europe must have adequate capacity under its own control by means of satellites."
"As the levels of investment required in this sector are enormous we should support European initiatives to develop space technology through the industry’s umbrella organisation."
"We do not necessarily need European hero-movie astronauts for this in Europe."
"The European Space Agency’s satellites will instead observe the important matter of the state of the environment, help in issues of transport and map the Earth’s inner space."
"Information on this should definitely be allowed to become more widespread in Europe."
"The European Union’s goal is a knowledge-based economy."
"That cannot work in any harmonious way without the space factor being involved."
"In fact it is important that Europe also integrates at the level of the space issue and is able to function properly as seen from space."
"So many of the problems we have today can be partially solved if we have viable and effective technology in space."
"– Mr President, the way today’s debate has been organised would be laughable if it were not such an expensive business."
"First it was delayed, then, with us all here, it was delayed for another hour without any explanation being given, and the interpreters will be along later."
"This is where I agree entirely with Mr Linkohr, who spoke before me, that one learns things as one gets older."
"I may well not have had much to say in favour of Friedrich von Hayek in my books and other works, but what I see in this place from one day to another is such a waste of money – not yours, not Parliament’s, but the taxpayer’s – that I have come to think of the whole thing as a hypocritical farce."
"By way of contrast, I would like to know whether we would organise debates in their current form if it were your money!"
"That also means – and this brings me to what I wanted to talk about – that I was originally only meant to have one minute, but, the way things are organised, I still have one, so please do not regard this minute as taking us off the subject."
"Now for my minute on space travel."
"Are we not falling into the very trap of saying that if something makes sense in principle – be it this House or the peaceful use of space travel – then it actually works? It does not actually work out like that."
"If we look at the report, at the second part of item 17, and at item 18, then what is this dual use?"
"How are the two kept separate? Where can I, as a citizen, know what I am now actually getting in return for my tax, and where I am getting it?"
"Do we not notice that, without military support, we might not get many of the things that would make sense in civilian terms?"
"How, then, are the two to be kept apart?"
"Is this not where we ourselves are being sucked into a new kind of military-industrial complex?"
"Are we in this House not the very people who are up in arms when a populist like Haider or Schwarzenegger suddenly wins elections?"
"What we urgently need, I believe, is transparency – in space travel and here in this House."
"Thank you for allowing me the chance to speak for two minutes."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to repeat my earlier thanks to Mr Bodrato, and also to all Members of this Parliament who have spoken in support of the idea of a European Union space policy."
"I believe that we are indeed at a pivotal moment in Europe for determining whether we are going to have our own independent and proactive space policy, taking us further both in terms of technology and of scientific development."
"In this regard, I believe that the support of this Parliament is crucial."
"This is why I wish briefly to respond to some points."
"First of all, in response to some speakers, the relationship between the European Space Agency and the European Union is clearly set out in a cooperation agreement and we have an excellent relationship, in a climate of mutual respect."
"The White Paper will furthermore be produced as a result of common agreement."
"I also wish to tell you that we need to give a new boost to every aspect of the telecommunications sector: GMES, environmental protection, the Galileo programme and security."
"As some honourable Members, including Mr Linkohr, have pointed out, this is crucial for scientific and technological development."
"All of these elements will be covered in the White Paper that we are in the process of drawing up and Parliament will, of course, be involved in discussions because this will be done before the end of the year."
"Similarly, the GMES programme will be implemented."
"I shall simply add that the debate over whether the technology used should be in military or civilian hands is sometimes a rather theoretical one, because if you look at the transmission of information, for example, it applies to many sectors."
"The aim is not, of course, military, but to make the best use of our research."
"Seeking to achieve this aim does not, however, mean that we have to react in a schizophrenic way by believing that there is a difference between civilian and military research."
"There is only research – full stop."
"This is a crucial point and I thank Mr Bodrato for having made it."
"What we need to do today is to reach a good agreement in the International Conference to ensure that space policy is truly a Union policy and, of course, to find the appropriate funding, without which we will never achieve our aims."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0257/2003) by Mr Della Vedova, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings: 'The EC Merger Regulation' (COM(2002) 711 - C5-0005/2003 - 2002/0296(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last December the Commission adopted a plan to implement an incisive reform of the system for controlling concentrations."
"The reform is the result of a review process that was launched in 2000, which is the basis for the new draft regulation that I hope the Council will soon adopt so that it can come into force in time for the forthcoming enlargement."
"The reform aims not to jeopardise the merits of the current system; what we are proposing is a series of significant improvements to the current system, intended, above all, to further improve the system in terms of the transparency and coherence of the control of concentrations."
"At the same time, over and above the regulation, we are improving the Commission’s decision-making process, ensuring that our inquiries into proposed mergers are more accurate, more focused and better supported by sound economic analysis and that they give full consideration to the rights of the parties involved in the concentration and of third parties; we are also aware of the fact that the Court of First Instance is asking the Commission for a high level of proof."
"This has obvious implications for the way in which we work."
"The package reforming the control of concentrations is made up of the proposal for a new Community merger regulation and of a draft communication that contains guidelines on assessing horizontal mergers."
"In recent months, in addition to the preparation of these documents, many measures relating to the staff and internal organisation of the Competition Directorate General have been adopted, in particular the introduction of a new figure – the chief competition economist – and processes such as the peerreviewpanel to ensure greater clarity of control during analysis."
"The proposal for a new merger regulation is characterised by three main elements: firstly, clarification of the substantive test for evaluating the possible effects of concentrations on competition; secondly, jurisdictional issues, where we are proposing to rationalise the system of referrals between the Commission and Member States; thirdly and lastly, numerous procedural changes are being proposed to give slightly more flexibility in timeframes for inspections and for notification of a concentration, as well as aligning the powers of fact-finding provided for in the merger regulation with those that are set down in Regulation No 1/2003, which, as you know, relates to the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, over the past three years, the Commission has been involved in a thorough review of the Community antitrust system."
"As you mentioned, Commissioner, the proposal for a new regulation on concentrations between undertakings before us today represents one of the key phases of that review process."
"The previous regulation had become increasingly central to the EU’s competition policy."
"It had considerable merits, offering the undertakings involved in mergers a ‘one-stop shop’ and preset deadlines."
"However, the growing integration of markets and the consequent increase in the number and relevance of merger cases examined by the Commission has brought the existing rules to a critical point, as demonstrated by the recent Court of Justice judgments rejecting certain decisions by the Commission, something you, yourself, also referred to, Commissioner."
"Hence the need to reform the existing rules, and the Commission is to be congratulated for having reacted swiftly to this need."
"The three vital points both in the Commission proposal and also in Parliament's report, points that you drew attention to yourself, Commissioner, are the substantive test, jurisdiction and procedural issues."
"As regards jurisdiction, that is to say the field of application of the regulation and thus the allocation of cases between the different national authorities, there is a need to solve the problem of multiple notifications, which will become even more serious for the businesses affected following enlargement."
"These multiple applications are totally at odds with the principle of the one-stop shop to which we have all referred."
"In its proposal, the Commission has abandoned both the possibility of changing thresholds, presumably because of the complications involved, and the ‘3+’ principle, although contained in the Green Paper, which was advocated by Parliament in the Berenguer Fuster report."
"This positive view was confirmed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which defined an automatic test also allowing for referral to the Commission during the pre-notification stage, when a case has to be notified to several national authorities."
"Parliament accordingly wishes to reiterate the line already taken in the debate on the Green Paper."
"With regard to principle, the substantive test has nevertheless proved effective up to now, although this has been keenly debated."
"Some people have proposed switching to a substantial lessening of competition test, a principle used in the United States and in some Member States."
"In this respect, your rapporteur acted on the Commission's proposal to add a paragraph to Article 2, which would have defined the concept of dominant position more clearly."
"I, personally, suggested a rewording, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided at this stage to call on the Commission to leave things as they are, thus backing the value of the test and of its effectiveness, as demonstrated up to now."
"As regards procedural issues, I would like to say a few words about powers of investigation."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed toning down some of the provisions in the proposal for a regulation, given that we believe that, on grounds of proportionality, it is absolutely unnecessary to bring the Commission’s powers of investigation for mergers into line with the powers envisaged for cartels, since the areas concerned are completely different."
"A merger essentially represents ‘business as usual’ and we do not, therefore, believe there should be any presumption that the rules have been breached."
"This gives this House all the more reason to believe that we should stand firm on this issue, given the powers that the Commission is proposing to grant itself, albeit quite legitimately."
"We believe that Parliament should adopt a position offering a better guarantee here."
"I would like to make two points by way of conclusion."
"Firstly, there is the position of the workforce."
"During the debate, some Members, in particular the Socialists, expressed their concern and a proposal to take into account the possible employment impact of merger operations, and even proposed that the acceptability of a merger should be dependent on preserving jobs."
"We believe that this is not the right place to insert a clause of this kind, because there is a danger that it would conflict with the overall logic of the regulation, which is to guarantee a competitive single market precisely in order to increase employment."
"As regards worker participation and information, the regulation already contains some provisions in this respect; further provisions in precisely this area are envisaged in other European legislation."
"I do not believe that there is any need to include these provisions here and, in view of this, I would ask the House and, in particular, Mr Berenguer Fuster and Mrs van den Burg, to reconsider. The fact that these amendments will be rejected should not be allowed to prejudice the vote on the entire legislative proposal."
"I am, however, happy to support Mr Schmidt's amendment."
". I have the luxury of being able to address the Parliament twice in succession."
"I will only do so once, but I hope – if you do not mind – that I can combine the speaking times."
"Mr President, I have, first of all, a great deal of appreciation for the Commission's proposals for the revision of the regulation on the control of concentrations and an exceptional amount of appreciation for the sterling report by Mr Della Vedova."
"We support the objective of creating more clarity, legal certainty and quicker procedures."
"Against this background, I should like to make a few observations."
"In the first instance, Parliament welcomed the Green Paper’s proposals for a ‘one-stop-shop’ system in Brussels for multiple filings in more than two Member States."
"As Mr Della Vedova said a moment ago, that is why we regret the Commission’s failure to incorporate this principle in the present proposal."
"With the forthcoming enlargement, the number of multiple filings will increase substantially, always assuming that policy remains unchanged."
"The lack of mutual coordination among Member States has led to bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming procedures."
"The coordination and harmonisation of national procedures is very much what is wanted and we would therefore urge the Commissioner to make every effort to promote this idea."
"I know that this does not fall within the Commission's remit, but it can, of course, talk to the Member States and call for further harmonisation and mutual coordination."
"A single procedure in Brussels will not only cost less but will also significantly improve legal certainty for businesses and ensure that the procedure can be completed more quickly."
"The Commission does create some scope for promoting central processing in Brussels by means of the referral procedure, but we do not believe that this goes far enough."
"If a merger clearly has a cross-border impact, it ought to be considered by the Commission wherever possible."
"It should be made possible for cases to be referred to the Commission on the basis of objective criteria and at the request of the merging parties."
"We have developed concrete proposals to this effect."
"For the same reasons, the idea of referring concentrations to Member States needs to be treated with caution."
"Concentrations that comply with the requirements of a simplified procedure ought not, in principle, to be referred to the Member States."
"One of the purposes of this revision of the regulation is to increase legal certainty."
"However, in our view, if the concept of the dominant economic position is broadened in the way proposed by the Commission, this is more likely to have the opposite effect."
"Any merger conferring a certain advantage over competitors would fall within the new definition."
"All parties concerned are used to applying the existing definition, on which there is now ample case law."
"A change in the definition would obscure the situation and lead to unnecessary legal uncertainty."
"Moreover, there is, in our opinion, a danger that the market would lose its dynamism if concentration processes were to be interfered with on a far bigger scale than at present."
"I accordingly believe that it would be better not to expand the definition."
"We agree with the proposal to leave Article 2(1) unchanged."
"However, the requirements applicable to evidence of the existence of efficiencies must not become excessive."
"It is future advantages that would have to be demonstrated, and these cannot possibly be guaranteed 100%."
"There is a need to clarify exactly when relevant information about efficiencies would have to be provided."
"The Commission calls for a substantial expansion of its powers of investigation, in line with those relating to cartel procedures under Regulation 1/2003."
"However, in our view, there is an essential difference between the aim of merger control and combating violations of cartel rules."
"When investigating a concentration, unlike in the case of a cartel violation, it is not assumed that the law has been broken."
"We accordingly consider the Commission’s proposal for increasing its investigative resources under this Regulation excessive, particularly if viewed in the context of the enormous fines that the Commission can impose for non-compliance with the provisions of the Regulation."
"No one can be compelled to give evidence against himself."
"This is an important basic principle of criminal law and should apply here too."
"It is therefore well worth laying down in the Regulation that, when carrying out an investigation, the Commission should respect the rights of the parties concerned."
"This particularly applies to the right to silence for company lawyers, and also indeed for other employees whom the Commission may question."
"Additionally, I would draw attention to the lack of internal and external monitoring of the Commission’s decision-making."
"As things stand at present, there is no separation between the investigating authority and the authority taking the decision."
"This is difficult to reconcile with the requirement of legal certainty and independence."
"The legitimacy of decision-making can be further promoted by setting up a specialised chamber for competition at the Court of First Instance."
"This could also speed up the procedure and improve the quality of the administration of justice."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur has just pointed out, Community competition law has undergone substantial reform over recent years, which is now culminating in the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 on conciliations."
"It is true that, if we accept the comments of Mr Monti, it is still necessary to make proposals in the field of the public aid proposed, and I wish them every success, even though it cannot be denied that this is clearly a road strewn with dangers and difficulties."
"In the field of conciliations, it is the case that the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 has not been as radical a change as the one which has taken place, for example, in the field of anti-competitive behaviour."
"This is firstly due to the fact that Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 was a good regulation, it was a good legislative text, which has allowed us to carry out a suitable Community competition policy in the field of conciliations."
"In September 2000, on the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission organised a seminar to discuss it and the opinions expressed by the specialists and sectors involved in it were positive, despite the criticism of certain very specific aspects."
"Subsequently, the Commission produced a Green Paper containing proposals for reform, which were also partial and specific, which deserved the clear support of this Parliament."
"We are now debating the report on the proposed reform;"
"Mr Della Vedova has produced a wonderful report and I congratulate him on it. The report contains some very significant aspects, and perhaps one of the very important aspects which should be stressed is that it differs from the Commission’s report on a point on which, at the same time, the Commission differs from the proposal contained in its Green Paper."
"This is the problem of multiple notifications."
"These multiple notifications increase the costs for notifiers and affect legal certainty since, in so far as various authorities have to decide on a single concentration, there is always the possibility of contradictory resolutions."
"And if there was anything on which there was complete agreement it was the fact that the unnecessarily complex rule in Article 1(3), introduced in the 1997 reform, had not contributed to resolving the problem."
"Therefore, the Green Paper proposed the three-country rule, but now that rule is being forgotten in favour of a system, which is welcome, of two-way communications, either from the national authorities to the Commission, or from the Commission to the national authorities."
"But maintaining the text of Article 1(3)."
"The truth is that, as I have said, the improvement of these referral mechanisms deserved our applause, but we do not understand the reasons for having forgotten the three-country rule, unless it has been detected that, as happened in 1997, the majority of countries wish to keep in their hands a significant competence to implement policies with industrial content, which is not always necessary."
"Mr Della Vedova has mentioned the Socialist Group's insistence on the participation of workers and says that this is not the place to deal with it."
"I cannot agree with that opinion."
"We must bear in mind that, regardless of whether the conditions relating to efficiencies is reformed, any competition authority, on approving a concentration, takes account of certain efficiencies and there is no question that one of the most important of these efficiencies is the maintenance or creation of jobs, and this being the case, the information the representatives of the workers can provide is important."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Della Vedova for an excellent report that has the full support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"If I were to grade different areas of responsibility within the EU, issues of competition would be among the most important."
"The work you do, Mr Monti, is of the greatest importance if the market economy is to operate, if Europe is to be able to grow, if there is to be a business-oriented EU and if all European consumers are to be given a choice in respect of low prices and high quality."
"Trying to strike a balance between the interests of companies and those of the consumer is not always simple, but I respect you for the work you have done."
"It is of necessity that the concentration rules are now being reviewed and modernised."
"The market is changing."
"Competition is increasing, and internationalisation and globalisation give rise to different basic conditions."
"We are entitled to demand that the EU’s concentration rules be legally secure and predictable, that investigations and assessments be genuine and rapidly carried out and that both the Commission’s and the national authorities’ rules be clear."
"These are things we are entitled to demand, Mr President."
"The Della Vedova report further strengthens the Commission’s proposals in these respects."
"We believe it would be a step in the wrong direction to enlarge what is called the concept of dominance."
"Allow me to touch upon the amendments by the ELDR Group."
"The Commission should be able to have a more dynamic and long-term perspective when the market basis is assessed in the case of concentrations and be able to see the common market in a global context."
"That applies in purely general terms but, in particular, it is important for leading companies in smaller countries to be able to grow stronger, within their own countries as well, and to do so with a view to providing more jobs within the whole of the EU and to increasing competitiveness outside the EU too."
"We are sympathetic towards the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The employees’ viewpoints are, of course, important, but concentrations of that type should, in our view, not be regulated in this context."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission’s advocacy of the maintenance of free competition in Europe is of course something to be welcomed."
"We are of course in favour of rigorous measures being taken to deal with cartel agreements, but control measures, whether at national or European level, must not be designed in such a way that free competition is hampered by red tape."
"This means that the Regulation that is to be enacted must end up increasing legal certainty, and must not reduce it."
"With this in mind, we will endorse the amendments that our fellow-Members have tabled."
"Mr President, it will not have escaped the attention of those involved in this issue that those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who are also members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against the final report."
"I think this is very regrettable, because, as it has been stated here before, it is indeed an excellent report and the rapporteur has done a good job."
"The situation was such, however, that the amendments tabled by our group had simply not received any support from other groups."
"This is why it was difficult for us to vote in favour."
"We have re-tabled some of those amendments in this plenary, for we have really whittled them down to what we think was really essential and necessary."
"I sincerely hope that other groups, particularly the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has taken our side on issues of this kind in the past, are prepared to re-consider this carefully, so that we can vote in favour of this report wholeheartedly and without any reservations."
"I will explain the kind of amendments they are, and I want to demonstrate why these, in our view, are perfectly in keeping with the Lisbon agenda."
"The guiding principle underlying the Lisbon agenda is that policy must become more coherent so as to promote greater competitiveness, sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion."
"This means that we have to abandon the three-pillars structure and ensure that policy adopted in the various directorates-general and in the various councils of ministers is also in line with our other objectives."
"Consideration should in this respect also be given to the required cohesion of policy."
"Consequently, with regard to the regulation on concentrations, we would particularly draw your attention to two aspects."
"First of all, the assessment should consider aspects other than competition in the narrow sense of the word."
"In our amendment, we explicitly call for considerations with regard to the contribution that concentrations can make to improved production and marketing systems, to international competitiveness, to consumer interests and to the creation of jobs and the employment situation in general."
"This is thus a reasonably wide definition, and one that is capable of offering the necessary flexibility and room for manoeuvre."
"Amendment No 37 contains words to this effect."
"The second aspect is about a serious and fully-fledged consultation of employee representatives within the procedures."
"Particularly Amendments Nos 40 and 41 concern this topic."
"In current practice, employee councils or trade union representatives are heard only at their explicit request, that is, if they have at their disposal information that tells them that a concentration or merger is in progress."
"Then there is the question of whether their arguments will be addressed seriously if they are consulted about the employment and social implications of the proposed merger."
"This ties in with the other amendment I mentioned."
"They should be called upon by the authorities not only to gain an insight into the market positions and competitive risks, but it should also be possible to have serious discussions about those other effects."
"This should form a standard component of the procedure and this is what we hope our amendments will achieve."
"I truly hope that this will be re-considered in the other groups."
"I would already like to thank Mr Olle Schmitt for his support for part of these amendments."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs van den Burg was right to stress that the Christian Democrat group has very often joined with other groups in taking the interests of workers into account when competition policy and models of economic policy are under consideration."
"We have done this because our group stands for the social market economy, because we back the Lisbon objectives, and because social cohesion is not incompatible with economic success; on the contrary, it is contingent upon it."
"We will not, however, be supporting the Social Democrats’ amendments, either in committee or in plenary, as these things have to be dealt with where they belong."
"Most of those who have spoken before me have pointed out that this refusal does not go against people’s interests, but that we must find a place for our concerns where the matter in hand requires it, and where the most good can result."
"The control of mergers is meant to ensure that EU law applies to them, and it is because the Mergers Regulation works well as an instrument of European competition legislation that we are all appealing to the Commission."
"It would be a mistake if amendments, albeit necessary ones, to an essentially good and workable instrument were to make it more bureaucratic, more costly and more time-consuming than it at present is in a form that has stood the test of time."
"We therefore endorse the Regulation’s objectives."
"It has to be said, for the benefit of those listening to this debate, that Parliament has no power of codecision on this issue, but is simply being consulted."
"We want greater clarity, greater legal certainty and the introduction of speedier procedures."
"That is why we also endorse the proposal for more flexible deadlines, which will bring great advantages to businesses."
"It is apparent from all the interventions that there are three points on which we have had criticisms to make, and we will continue to make them in the hope that the Commission will change tack."
"The first of them is that – as I see it – Parliament holds fast to the one-stop-shop principle."
"What this means is that, where a merger crosses more than two borders between Member States, this has to be reported directly to the Commission."
"This makes for clarity, legal certainty and is the simplest way of doing things in view of EU enlargement."
"I see the abandonment of the principle in the Green Book as regrettable, and urge you to return to it."
"You would thereby be helping to reduce costs and bureaucracy and increase legal certainty."
"A second point is the definition of the market."
"We believe that your definition of the ‘economically dominant position’ is too broad and that the old definition is potentially clearer."
"The third point is one that must be faced head-on – the issue of the way in which the provisions on mergers are being brought closer to those in the Cartels Regulation."
"Here, you are confusing apples with pears."
"What needs to be made clear is that mergers are legal, whereas cartels are not."
"This distinction must be kept and the two must not be confused with one another."
"– Mr President, the Commission has proposed a new regulation on concentrations between undertakings, as part of the broader project of updating the legislation on violations of competition rules and the effects such violations might have on the proper functioning of the single market."
"This is an extremely sensitive area, in which legal certainty should be enhanced and administrative procedures made more flexible. The transparency and monitoring of decisions, and appeals against them, should also be improved, as should the active, dynamic and appropriate participation of all the parties involved in undertakings."
"Concentrations or mergers between undertakings are a fundamental economic and legal process. They make the markets more dynamic, help undertakings to restructure and encourage economies to grow."
"This process cannot and should not be perceived as leading inevitably to the abuse of a dominant position."
"A very clear distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, the whole business of investigating violations of competition rules following allegedly irregular behaviour and, on the other, the normal process of monitoring a merger, which should, as a matter of principle, be accepted as legal and in accordance with the rules governing the market."
"That is why the amendments already approved by the Parliamentary committee, and those to be tabled in plenary, in particular by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are of fundamental importance."
"In Community legislation and its underlying political philosophy, competition is not an end in itself. It is, rather, an instrument with which to achieve and attain the Union’s major goals."
"Extreme caution is needed, therefore, when adopting European Union legislation with a view to substantially reducing competition (such laws exist in other legislative systems, in particular in the United States). It is only right for the final positions of the Parliamentary committee and the rapporteur to reflect this caution."
"It should not be forgotten, furthermore, that the majority of those consulted in business circles expressed reservations and concerns about the adoption of new legislation, especially in view of the fact that the legislation on abuse of the dominant position has worked well up to now."
"The efforts made by the Commission to table this proposal for a regulation, following the December 2001 Green Paper, are much to be commended, and deserve Parliament’s support overall."
"It is crucial, however, that some amendments be introduced to improve the text of this report, emphasising legal certainty and, above all, highlighting the role which workers in the merging undertakings should play. The workers should oversee the whole process and provide not only relevant information but also guarantees that the operation in question will be an economic and social success."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is surprising that company mergers, which are one response to the challenge of globalisation, are often dealt with under the heading of ‘cartel law’, which has nothing to do with them."
"Cooperation comes about quite legally, with the objective of maximising opportunities on global markets; it is an important element in the free and dynamic internal market."
"It therefore follows that they still have their problems, most of which arise when widely divergent enterprise cultures are brought together."
"The new structures that result make for more conflicts."
"Businesses are often slimmed down, resulting in severe job losses."
"If there is to be a single European internal market, it needs to be laid down in unambiguous terms precisely when mergers have to be reported."
"In its Green Paper, the Commission has already stressed that they are always to fall within its own remit where mergers have been reported to the authorities in at least three Member States, and that is also the line that I take."
"I am convinced that this is where costly and time-consuming procedures in the Member States can at last be done away with."
"Rather than perpetuating the fragmentation that is already widespread, there may quite probably – as my colleagues have already pointed out – be some simplification and tightening-up, not to mention greater legal certainty."
"While this is going on, national competition rules must continue to apply in full, although they must not conflict with Community rules."
"It strikes me that the imminent enlargement of our European Union will make the one-stop-shop system ever more important."
"If I may add a comment on the threshold value, our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes that the Commission should look into the merger of companies if their joint turnover in at least three Member States is greater than 10% of their overall turnover in the European Union."
"There is another point, Commissioner Monti, where I cannot support the Commission’s position."
"You seek to extend the definition of companies’ ‘economically dominant position’ to cover markets that are oligopolies, no matter when the merger comes about. Let me quote: ‘has a tangible and lasting influence on competition’."
"It is all too logical that mergers are meant to procure advantages over against competitors."
"I warn you against over-regulation."
"The markets would lose much of the dynamism that they need."
"Mr Della Vedova’s report is sound, and my Group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is in absolute agreement with it."
"The Socialists have tabled a number of new amendments, and, Mrs van den Burg, we will be voting on them tomorrow."
"Much of what these amendments contain one can certainly live with – but not in this report and not at this juncture."
"We are the party of the social market economy, and nothing will change that, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out, but introducing small amendments into these positions is like applying small amounts of cosmetics."
"That is something we must formulate elsewhere; that must indeed be clearly articulated, and I believe that we can find a common mind if we do this somewhere else."
"I hope that it will be possible for one or other amendment to be withdrawn; perhaps we will manage to get a broad consensus by tomorrow lunchtime."
"I am firmly convinced that this report by Mr Della Vedova deserves one rather than our later being suddenly disunited."
"Perhaps the Socialists will have a few new ideas by tomorrow."
"That is very much to be wished."
". Mr President, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate for their valuable contributions, and I would particularly like to thank Mr Della Vedova, the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Mr Doorn, draftsman for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I am delighted to see that, by and large, the report supports the Commission's proposal, and that we share the same general objectives with regard to the need for reform."
"The Commission is, however, I am afraid, unable to accept the various amendments tabled."
"I would like to explain why, although, for, reasons of time I shall have to be brief, starting with the substantive test in the regulation on concentrations."
"The Commission has come to the conclusion that the substantive test should be clarified, by adding a few words to the present text - words that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to see removed."
"Why do we think that this change is needed?"
"Many observers believe that the present test may not be adequate to cope with concentrations that raise competition problems in cases of what is known as ’non-collusive oligopoly’."
"If this is true, opting to keep the dominant position test as it is would mean failing to take advantage of an opportunity to make it clear that the substantive test for assessing concentrations will be applied without fail to all concentrations harmful to consumers' interests."
"I would also like to emphasise that the prevailing view in international economic literature is that oligopoly situations arising from concentrations can have long-term anticompetitive effects and thus harm consumers' interests."
"The Commission brought forward its proposal because it had become aware of the need to guarantee maximum legal certainty, an objective which it seems to me was generally shared and supported by various speakers, including Mr Olle Schmidt, Mr Ilgenfritz, Mr Santos and others."
"The greatest legal certainty you can have here is a genuinely effective instrument for controlling concentrations."
"We are convinced that the wording proposed would provide the greatest legal certainty possible."
"As regards jurisdiction, a subject covered in depth in the Della Vedova and Doorn reports, and one on which various speakers commented, including Mr Berenguer Fuster and Mr Karas, I believe we all agree that it is necessary to achieve a sensible division of labour between the Commission and the Member States, thus minimising the burdens on companies and on public regulatory authorities."
"This means having allocation thresholds which, as far as possible, reflect an optimum division, and applying a referral system that can, so to speak, rectify incorrect allocations as far as is possible."
"We therefore propose to simplify and make more flexible the provisions for referring cases from the Commission to Member States and vice versa, thus also making it possible, as some companies have indicated would be helpful, for referral to take place even before notification."
"What lies behind our position on the amendments proposed in relation to jurisdiction?"
"Your report, Mr Della Vedova, proposes a ‘2+’ rule combined with new turnover thresholds."
"I fully appreciate the intentions behind the proposed amendment, but I believe that it would introduce an additional complication, because companies would first have to find out where to notify an operation."
"That is the reason, Mr Berenguer Fuster, why we, ourselves, dropped the idea, appealing as it is, of a ‘3+’ system, because it would come up against the situation of non-harmonised national legislation on concentrations, for the time being at least."
"This might be a longer-term objective, but it is not one for today."
"As regards partial referrals to Member States, I agree that we should keep these to a minimum, but I also believe that it would not be advisable totally to rule out such referrals, because they may be appropriate in some cases."
"I now wish to turn to a subject that has attracted a lot of attention and concern."
"The Commission has also proposed that its own powers of enforcement, as laid down in the regulation on concentrations, should, to a large extent, be brought in line with the new regulation, Regulation 1/2003."
"There are, in particular, two exceptions, namely the power to search private homes and the power to conduct investigations into sectors of the economy, which we, too, do not believe to be necessary for controlling concentrations."
"We do not, therefore, propose to introduce such powers."
"I can assure you that, like you, we believe that there should not be any presumption that the law is being breached in concentrations, and that they are, therefore, effectively different from cartels, for example."
"That much is clear."
"I would like to reassure the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, the draftsman, Mr Doorn, and also Mr Karas, Mr Mann and other Members about this basic principle."
"It is therefore only right that our powers of enforcement should not be any more extensive than necessary."
"Nevertheless, our priority objective is to ensure that these powers are sufficiently effective to allow the Commission to discharge its duties and to protect consumers against the risk of harm from anticompetitive concentrations, and I believe that the powers we have proposed are necessary to this end."
"Of course, you may well argue that, as control of concentrations is an area different from other aspects of competition, less draconian powers are needed here than those required, for instance, to combat cartels."
"Although I have said that these are two different areas, forgive me if I come to a different conclusion about enforcement powers."
"Why?"
"Because concentrations have a unique one-off if you like  structural impact on the market, which is irreversible."
"For this reason, there is an argument that it is even more vital for the Commission to have effective powers to collect information, as otherwise we may reach a decision whose consequences for competition would be irreparable."
"My final point, Mr President, concerns workers' rights, a subject raised by Mr Berenguer Fuster, Mrs van den Burg and Mr Santos, and an issue on which other Members disagreed with them."
"I believe - like those dissenting voices - that we are all working within the social market economy, and we consider workers' rights to be of the utmost importance."
"In fact, as has already been mentioned, appropriate instruments exist at Community level, but we believe there is a need for appropriate allocation of the various instruments to a range of different objectives."
"The regulation on concentrations is principally concerned with the components of the social market economy, and we do not, therefore, believe that it should be cluttered with measures to stimulate or safeguard employment: there are other instruments for that."
"In any case, the notifications are in the public domain, so that interested parties, including trade union representatives, are kept fully informed of whatever merger operations are in progress."
"We have, in any case, welcomed, and, what is more, at times actually sought the input that workers' representatives can provide in the procedure."
"I would like to thank all the speakers once again for their contributions and, in particular, Mr Della Vedova and Mr Doorn."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0311/2003) by Mr Rack, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road Network (COM(2002) 769 - C5-0635/2002 - 2002/0309(COD))."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you all remember the terrible fires that occurred in French, Italian, Austrian and Swiss road tunnels in 1999 and 2001."
"In order to prevent any repetition of these disasters, or at least to ensure that if they do occur the consequences are not so tragic, at the beginning of the year the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive seeking to establish minimum safety requirements for tunnels."
"The Commission also received encouragement for its approach through several resolutions adopted by your Parliament, specifically following the fire in the Gothard tunnel in October 2001."
"The Commission proposal targets all road tunnels over 500 metres long that form part of the trans-European network, totalling around 500 tunnels."
"Tunnels in the trans-European network are actually used by drivers of all nationalities and it appears that the consequences of fires can be considerably diminished if persons finding themselves in such situations have access to standard safety equipment and to homogenous information on the best attitude to adopt in order to protect themselves."
"The proposal contains both technical and organisational requirements."
"Without listing all the measures, the most important ones can be summarised as follows: extremely long tunnels must have fully working equipment, in particular emergency exits and improved ventilation systems."
"Automatic fire detectors must be capable of informing tunnel users of any potential danger."
"The Commission also proposes that emergency signals with a uniform safety standard should be installed and should be easy to understand for all users."
"We believe that all the proposed technical measures are necessary."
"Some people have been surprised at the highly technical nature of the proposal but if you compare the measures envisaged for the technical regulations set by international courts, or at national level, you will realise that these are necessary in order to cover the essential aspects."
"At the organisational level, roles and responsibilities will from now on be clearly divided between the main actors involved, who are: the administrative authority, the tunnel user and the person or body responsible for safety."
"These measures will apply to new tunnels, and also to existing tunnels, which will have to be brought up to standard in line with a timetable spread over ten to fifteen years."
"Member States that have more than the Community average number of tunnels in their territory will have a longer deadline for bringing their older tunnels into line with the directive."
"The task facing the engineers responsible for the safety of these tunnels in the Member States is a long one and the directive must be adopted as soon as possible."
"As a result of the meetings that we have already held with some of you, I know that we can count on you to reach rapid agreement with the Council on this dossier."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although tunnels are among the safest parts of the European road network, accidents in tunnels often result in grave consequences, among which the psychological effects are not to be ignored."
"In tunnels, people feel shut in."
"The three major accidents in the Tauern, Mont Blanc and St Gotthard tunnels – to which the Commissioner has already referred – made the peculiar characteristics of accidents in tunnels tragically apparent."
"When these accidents occurred, Parliament pressed the Commission to initiate action on tunnel safety."
"Some time elapsed before the Commission, at the beginning of this year, submitted its proposal for a directive on minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels in the trans-European road network."
"Let it be emphasised from the outset that this proposal by the Commission is a good one."
"Our amendments were an attempt at making it even better, and I believe that we succeeded in doing so by dint of cooperation with the Commission and good dialogue with the Council, which, working in parallel with us, agreed a few days ago on the content of its Common Position, which it is – or so I hear – keen to complete tomorrow."
"We can expect, at second reading, to come to very quick agreement on a common directive, aiming to make European road transport safer, and in the hope that we will do so as soon as possible."
"In the longer term, though, we cannot be satisfied with this outcome."
"Our joint proposal – as I would like to call it – still has an array of cosmetic blemishes and real defects."
"Let me start by pointing them out."
"Our text focuses on one partial aspect of the issue of tunnel safety."
"In essence, we are demanding high standards in building work and elsewhere, but it is equally important to make improvements to the way in which people use tunnels."
"There needs to be better general training of drivers, and there is a particular need for better-trained drivers of passenger and freight vehicles."
"Nor can we be content with improving the safety of tunnels that are part of the TENs, while taking no account of the other road tunnels."
"We must act as quickly as possible to incorporate into our system the candidate countries and the others that intend to join us, and, as there is more to Europe than the EU, countries such as Switzerland, Norway and others as well."
"The Commission has held out to us the prospect of certain things being done in response to these points."
"To some extent, though, it is the jurisdiction situation that prevents us from using legislation to work towards what we need, so, together, we have a certain amount of persuading to do."
"The candidate countries and those Europeans who are not yet in the EU have already, this time round, participated very actively in our work, and we hope they will continue to do so."
"I will take it as read that our proposal’s good points largely speak for themselves, but there are a number of details to which I would nevertheless like to give special mention."
"We tried very hard to lay down clear lines of responsibility."
"We worked hard to achieve flexibility, so that the users of tunnels can enjoy a properly high level of safety without delay, particularly where tunnels are old and in need of repair."
"We also attached particular importance to the practicability of what we were proposing in very many individual cases, of which the particular problems of tunnels in cities may be taken as representative."
"One issue whose importance has been particularly stressed to me back home has to do with the safety of disabled people."
"I hope that we have come to the right conclusion as to what they need, and we have made constructive efforts to ensure that they too, in the event of a calamity, can expect a minimum standard of safety."
"My final task as rapporteur is a thankful one."
"I would like to thank the many people who have helped to achieve this outcome in which we all share: the Commission and its staff; the various partners in dialogue from the Member States, but also – even though I am repeating myself – from Switzerland and Norway, and the Members of all the groups in this House and their assistants."
"Last but not least, I would like to express my personal gratitude to the member of the Committee secretariat, Mr Haug, for his many hours of dedicated work."
"I hope that, at second reading, he will support us as efficiently as he has done to date, and that things will work together so that we have, as soon as possible, better laws on safety in European tunnels."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur’s amendments to the Commission proposal are excellent, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses them."
"Most of the amendments tabled by Mr Rack are intended on the one hand, to prescribe realistic safety standards for tunnels, and, on the other, to avoid the system for responsibility for implementation of common safety standards becoming too complicated and bureaucratic."
"I believe that he deserves particular credit for this."
"As the rules on the safety of tunnels tend very much to have been drafted with the tunnels in the Alps and similar areas in mind, but would make for major problems with traffic flow in those tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network that run through towns and cities, we endorse the rapporteur’s proposal that the administrative authorities be empowered to grant derogations from the general regulations for special tunnels in urban areas, as the minimum intervals – of 100 metres between HGVs, for example – would result in substantial tailbacks and hence in greater damage to the environment in tunnels in cities, the tunnel under the Elbe in Hamburg being one example."
"Similar considerations apply in the case of the obligatory examination of HGVs equipped with additional tanks before they enter a tunnel, which, thank God, is to be dropped as a result of the rapporteur’s vote."
"Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the demand that building work to improve the safety of tunnels should receive general financial support from the TENs budget, as such measures could well overstretch the financial resources of individual Member States, and as improved safety in tunnels belonging to the trans-European transport network is in the interest of all citizens of the EU."
"If I may put that in more specific terms, Commissioner, most tunnels are situated in that lovely country, Italy, and if Italy were to bear alone the cost of making transport safe, it would make for a problem for us all."
"That being so, I believe it to be important that the Community should – Mr Swoboda is catching my eye at this point – use TENs funds to cover a share of the work on improving tunnels in those countries that have long ones, as the reason why we want to improve the tunnels that these countries provide – whether we are talking here about Austria, Italy or even Switzerland and France – is the safety of those who travel through them, who are not only Italians and Austrians, but also many Danes, Germans and people from the Netherlands."
"This means that this aspect of finance is one that we should particularly take into account."
"Again, though, many thanks, Mr Rack, for your outstanding report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by thanking Mr Jarzembowski for the way in which he acknowledges the great value of transit areas for Europe’s road users as a whole, in view of which I do not doubt that he will play a very active part in the Conciliation Committee when it considers the transit issue."
"Thank you for that!"
"I wanted, of course, also to extend warm thanks to Mr Rack for his report and for the work he has done."
"It has indeed not been an easy task, but it has been a technical one, having much to do with the safety of our fellow citizens and with the protection of their lives and limbs."
"Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out how difficult it is to weigh in the balance maximum safety on the one hand and costs – which have to be affordable – on the other."
"If one were to look at this solely from the point of view of the safety of human beings, one would have to demand immediate rebuilding, with bi-directional tunnels and so on. If, though, one considers these things in relation to costs – which one also has to do – then a new middle way has to be found."
"I agreed with the rapporteur that the rather stringent regulation that the Commission proposed was a good foundation."
"It became apparent, though, in the course of debates in the committee, as well as in discussions with the Council and, eventually, with the Commission, that some points might well call for a gentler approach, and so we came to a compromise, but one that takes account of the essential safety aspects."
"Mr Jarzembowski has already made reference to the special conditions that apply in cities."
"We have always attached great importance to the clear demarcation of responsibilities, so that there should be no lack of clarity about who is responsible for what in matters affecting the safety of tunnels."
"That is why the establishment of supervisory bodies and the appointment of a safety coordinator for each tunnel is so very important, for we can see that the principal problem with safety measures of this kind is that nobody really feels responsible."
"It is also important that rules for this should be laid down by the European Union and that we in the committee accepted the Commission’s proposals with only minor modifications."
"I share the view that we should, of course, not limit ourselves to building work, but that measures should also be taken to organise traffic."
"On that, I would have liked to see better account taken of several amendments, but it has to be clear to us from the outset that diversions, speed restrictions and rules on the intervals between vehicles are necessary in those places where they make sense and will not lead to serious traffic jams, as is professional training for drivers of heavy goods vehicles – for it is particularly in connection with the transport of hazardous loads that we have seen particularly serious accidents."
"Just as is stated in the motion, I take the view that the Member States will of course have to comply by doing this not only with reference to the trans-European networks, but also, and to an adequate degree, in the other tunnels and in the other parts of the road network."
"So let me reiterate my belief that this is a good report with a realistic approach, and say that I agree with the Commissioner that we and the Council need to come to a shared solution without delay."
"Once again, then, many thanks to the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having seen a wide variety of serious accidents in tunnels in the European Union’s road network, discussion of how to guarantee a high standard of safety throws up, yet again, the crucial question as to the extent to which the European Union should lay down detailed and specific technical rules, or, to put it another way, how much leeway there has to be for various ways of adapting to change."
"Mr Rack’s compromise is the right one, and for finding it he deserves our gratitude."
"I do, nevertheless, have five comments to make."
"Firstly, and quite apart from all the flexibility involved in allocating tunnels to safety categories, it would have been desirable to lay down standardised indicators for assessing the safety of tunnels, which it might then have been sensible to use to analyse all the tunnels in the European Union, rather than only those forming part of the trans-European networks; this would have brought with it even greater added value in terms of improving safety."
"Such indicators would also make it possible to carry out a risk analysis or an evaluation of dangerous situations and accidents on the basis of common benchmarks."
"I therefore find it regrettable that the text no longer contains the Commission’s proposal on the standardised application of harmonised norms to working methods in conformity assessment bodies."
"Secondly, there is the closely-connected question of whether it is right that the tunnel management should, as an organisation with its own functions, also be able to be the body that investigates accidents."
"I do not think it should, as one cannot exclude the possibility of conflicts of interest, which would be detrimental to the maintenance of safety."
"Thirdly, I fully support the new ruling that, where tunnels impinge upon the territory of two Member States, joint investigating bodies are to be set up to exercise the necessary functions."
"Fourthly, it appears to me that, quite apart from the measures for which this report provides to impose minimum requirements for the safety of tunnels, there is a whole range of other actions that could help improve safety, and do so more simply and probably at less cost."
"In this I include what Mr Swoboda has already said about additional rules for tunnel users’ speed, the distance between their vehicles, the giving of particular signals, markings, and so on."
"My fifth point is that all the technical measures that have been proposed can have little effect when a driver is over-tired."
"Modern technology notwithstanding, what is ultimately crucial in road transport, as in so many other areas of society, is the human factor."
"I would therefore like to call upon the Council – even though it is not represented here – to deliver a final position on the Regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport."
"Mr President, we pay a high price for road traffic."
"And this time I am not referring to the Frenchor the German, but to the death and mutilation of people with a value as human beings that cannot be expressed in money terms."
"Every year, some 40 000 men and women die on our roads, the equivalent of two full jumbo jets crashing every week in the fifteen EU Member States."
"Annually, more than 200 000 people are scarred for life through injury and/or a handicap."
"Never do we in any way take note of these statistics."
"Last week, a delegation of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which I had the pleasure of chairing, visited two long tunnels with two-way traffic in the Alps."
"One of those was the Mont Blanc tunnel – 11.6 km long – where, in March 1999, a burning lorry caused an inferno, thereby claiming the lives of 39 people."
"Our visit started with a brief moment at the monument that was erected in memory of those victims."
"During the three years that this tunnel was subsequently closed, considerable investments have been made in a large number of facilities, which have been discussed in this report."
"Nevertheless, the sight of lorries passing each other in both directions on a total width of no more than seven metres is still a frightening one."
"Mr Rack has rendered the proposal more effective without underestimating the seriousness of the risks."
"We therefore hope that the Commission is willing to recognise this."
"Mr President, mountain ridges are a hindrance to crossing traffic, and so, tunnels offer the only solution to provide the shortest possible connecting route."
"It is an expensive solution; construction of such tunnels initially claimed many lives, and it was until recently used only in exceptional circumstances."
"The nineteenth century saw the start of railway tunnels, to which were added, in the twentieth, tunnels for cars."
"Meanwhile, engineering is increasingly enabling us to build tunnels under cities, under protected areas of outstanding natural beauty and under sea straits."
"These days, tunnel piping is inserted even under flat land consisting of soft, waterlogged peaty soil, as is the case in the Netherlands."
"Not only are tunnels now used on a much broader scale than in the past, but they are also used much more often."
"As a result, there is a considerably greater risk of explosions, fires and of people being suffocated."
"Until the recent fires, starting with the one in the Mont Blanc tunnel, far too little attention was paid to these risks."
"Meanwhile, economic interests mean that two-way lorry traffic across busy roads in one tunnel pipe is still permitted."
"Where this traffic is halted temporarily, it meets with protests from those living in the vicinity when it is allowed to resume."
"On the basis of experience gathered to date, I have reached the conclusion that tunnels without separate lanes and without parallel escape tunnels are unsuitable for use by large numbers of cars and by heavy goods traffic."
"Roads offer individual drivers too much freedom for dangerous and deviant behaviour."
"Tunnels offer more options for rail traffic, but here too, escape routes are required."
"Moreover, it is likely that the two extremely long tunnels that will run under Switzerland, and the Brenner base tunnel, designed to run from Germany to Italy under Austria, will be suitable only for freight traffic."
"My colleague, Mr Markov, has already addressed the issues of supervision and cross-border tunnels."
"Whilst I unreservedly support proposals to improve emergency exits and to make them suitable for wheelchair users, or other measures to step up safety requirements, I do not consider them to be adequate."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the lack of money in the public kitty, scarcely anyone can really object to improving safety standards on Europe’s roads in view of the yearly accident statistics, which show over 40 000 dead, and 1.6 million injured, some of them seriously."
"In Thuringia, the German province from which I come, the longest motorway tunnel in Germany was opened a few weeks ago."
"Even though it is also – as predicted beforehand, the safest – many drivers still find using it highly stressful."
"When the Commission launched its draft directive on the improvement of safety in tunnels, I was, on the one hand, glad that it is fundamentally in accordance with the third action programme to improve road safety, which we had welcomed, but I was also concerned and disturbed by the prospect of an enormous increase in bureaucracy and of the high costs resulting from it, which, it appeared, would devolve upon the Member States."
"After all, tunnel routes were not and are not among the most dangerous or accident-prone stretches of road in our Community."
"Today, my fears have been allayed, as the rapporteur – to whom let me now express my particular gratitude and appreciation – has managed after all to tighten up the draft directive, to further develop and restructure it, to make it less bureaucratic and its technical provisions more flexible."
"In this process, vitally significant safety aspects have not been disregarded; on the contrary, it has been possible to extend them, for example, by taking into account the safety needs of people with disabilities, which makes sense and is – and, I think, in view of this being the European Year of People with Disabilities – positively necessary."
"It remains to me to urge that this be speedily transposed into national law and to express the hope that it will have a tangible and positive effect on our road users, both in psychological and in real terms."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rack, and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for wholeheartedly embracing this highly technical proposal and for then managing it in a pragmatic and constructive way."
"I am pleased to note, first of all, that there is a broad degree of consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council on the measures to be adopted."
"Differences of opinion, where they occur, only relate to aspects that are relatively minor in comparison with the aims that are being pursued here and which are: to achieve, within a decade, a substantial improvement in the level of protection provided for users of major trans-European road network tunnels."
"With regard to Mr Rack’s report, I should like, Mr President and Mr Rack, not to go through the 78 amendments one by one, but to divide them into groups."
"Parliament has been given a set of highly technical amendments which are intended, if I am not mistaken, to bring the Commission’s proposal more into line with the text that has resulted from the work of the Council, which has itself held many meetings with experts on this issue."
"In principle, the Commission has no major objection to these amendments because we feel we have endeavoured to prevent the Council from deviating from the proposal’s original intentions."
"The Commission also wishes to highlight several amendments that pay specific attention to persons with disabilities, to ensure that they are able to escape in the event of a fire."
"We are, in principle, in favour of the directive making specific reference to disabled people."
"The experts tell us that, in the event of major fires that cannot be put out, users have only a very short time around ten minutes in which to reach shelter."
"Unfortunately, therefore, persons in wheelchairs, who move more slowly, are at greater risk than able-bodied people."
"We believe that all of the directive’s provisions will lead to considerable improvements to the protection of the disabled."
"Some amendments are intended to modify the terminology used in order to designate the various levels for which clarification of responsibilities is sought."
"The Commission does not wish to accept these amendments, because moving away from terminology which now appears to be almost universally accepted would not help us to achieve our goal of clarification."
"Some amendments relate to aspects not covered by the directive but which are important for tunnel safety or for implementing measures."
"I am thinking in particular of the amendments relating to driver training or to the financing of tunnel repairs."
"Although these are only simple recitals, they fall outside the scope of the directive and we do not feel able to accept them."
"In fact, when you add them up, the Commission can accept totally or in principle 52 amendments; it can accept one other in part and there are 25 amendments that it cannot accept."
"These somewhat stark figures are not an accurate reflection of the real situation, which is that between the Commission and Parliament, and I think I can say between Parliament and the Council, there is greater agreement than the figures suggest on the essential aspects of the dossier."
"I therefore wish to express the hope that the three institutions manage to take a decision so that the directive can be adopted rapidly."
"As I said, the engineers face a long haul in order to bring the tunnels into line with the provisions of the directive and this work must be begun as soon as possible."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0303/2003) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries (COM(2002) 637 - C5-0070/2003 - 2003/2034(INI))."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna will take the floor as a replacement for the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, who has been called away to attend to other higher duties."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a very important person is missing from the Chamber today, our rapporteur."
"Mr Cunha, as our President has said, has been called away to take up other political duties in his homeland, in the north of Portugal, and that is where he has gone."
"I would like firstly to congratulate him, as does the whole of this House I believe, for the good memories we all have of him and we wish him great success in his new role."
"Today we are debating his report, and I have the honour, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of presenting it to you."
"We are dealing with a very complete and very positive report, enriched with the amendments approved in our Committee on Fisheries."
"It describes all the enormous possibilities offered by international fisheries agreements, both for the European Union and for third countries."
"There remain in this Parliament certain recalcitrant Members who are dubious about the international fisheries agreements, but fortunately there are far fewer of them than in 1994 when we discussed this issue in this Parliament."
"The vast majority recognise their enormous advantages."
"Recently, 24 developing countries, who met in Galicia on 16 and 17 September at the , approved the conclusions of the fourth Conference of Fisheries Ministers, all of them calling for the maintenance and increase of international fisheries agreements as instruments for trade and development cooperation."
"That the benefits are mutual, nobody calls into question."
"And neither that they are essential to both parties."
"And that there must be no discrimination or differentiated treatment between certain agreements, such us those in the North, and others, such as those in the South, either."
"The development cooperation in the field of fisheries represented by international fisheries agreements is obvious; and that, through them, the European Union is achieving responsible fishing in these third-country fishing grounds and the development of a sustainable fisheries sector, is also obvious."
"The developing countries, at the fourth world conference which I have just referred to, all called for more cooperation, for more investments in their countries, for more scientists, for more joint undertakings, and this is undoubtedly the way forward for the future."
"Namibia, for example, is today a world fishing power, a zealous guardian of its fisheries resources and sustainable fishing, and this is all the result of European investments."
"Neither should we forget the essential commercial aspect of these fisheries agreements for the European Union, where they generate work for our fleets, jobs for our fishermen and work for our processing industries."
"Europe has the example of the adversity caused by the failure to renew certain fisheries agreements, as in the case of Morocco, which is still a controversial issue for this Parliament."
"And now it is also aware of the urgent need for relocation in other fishing grounds, within the context of these agreements, and for formulas, such as mixed undertakings and temporary associations of companies, when recovery plans are approved in accordance with scientific reports, which the European Union is the first to respect, such as those which are currently taking place in Community waters and non-Community waters, in external waters, as in the case of halibut in the NAFO."
"In summary, the international fisheries agreements are an essential mechanism for the European Union and for the third countries, since both parties benefit mutually from them, as the Cunha report points out in a crystal clear fashion."
"I therefore hope to have this House's support tomorrow in the vote."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna was right to note at the very outset that the one person missing today is the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, whom I am therefore unable to thank personally for his report on our communication on fisheries partnership agreements."
"Since becoming a Member of the European Parliament, Mr Cunha has done splendid work in drafting a whole array of reports on fisheries matters, for which we owe him a debt of gratitude."
"When I read the report, I was glad to note that the Commission and Parliament are pursuing the same objectives by way of future fisheries agreements."
"The Commission has always taken the view that the sustainability of fisheries needs to be ensured not only in Community waters, but also outside them."
"This agreement, therefore, is intended to put a greater emphasis than in the past on the environment, but without neglecting economic and social objectives."
"Deep-sea fishing is crucial to the economies of many coastal regions in the Community, and so support for it needs to continue."
"The report calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter, and also to regard a financial contribution as both part of a trade agreement and as development aid."
"With that I can wholeheartedly agree, but let me say, for the avoidance of misunderstandings, that the financial contribution is, on the one hand, to be paid in respect of the fisheries rights that are conceded and, on the other, is meant to help the third country to manage its stocks in a sustainable manner."
"It is to be credited to the third country’s budget."
"The Commission will then give the country with which the agreement is concluded active support in the form of know-how, enabling it, for example, to make fisheries controls more efficient or to improve research into the condition of stocks."
"I am convinced that new partnership agreements of this kind will be of great benefit both to the developing countries and to the Community."
"Mr President, it has been brought to my attention that Mr Hudghton raised a point of order earlier today in this Chamber under Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"He referred to a debate in the Scottish Parliament and a statement by a Conservative Member of that Parliament to the affect that it is incumbent on me, as Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, to represent the views of the UK Government."
"Firstly, may I say that I cannot answer for statements made by members of other parliaments, whoever or wherever they may be."
"Secondly, in view of the fact that the UK Government is a Labour government, and I am a Conservative, it would be rather strange, to say the least, if I felt obliged to represent their views either in my capacity as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee or indeed in any other role."
"Mr Hudghton seems unusually exercised by my role as Fisheries Committee Chairman these days."
"It is a great pity that he chooses to divert his energies into cheap, political point-scoring, rather than standing up for Scotland's beleaguered fishing industry."
"However, he may rest assured that I conduct my role as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee in an even-handed and democratic manner."
"Turning to the Cunha report, may I firstly place on record, as Mr Fischler and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna have done before me, the great appreciation of the members of the Fisheries Committee and indeed of most if not all of the Members of this House for the work undertaken by Mr Cunha during his term of office as an MEP representing Portugal."
"He has now, of course, returned to Portugal to take up a very senior position and we all wish him well for the future."
"I am sure that we will see more of him in the days to come."
"The high quality of the work undertaken by Mr Cunha has indeed been reflected in this report on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries."
"Many people are currently expressing anxiety over international fisheries agreements entered into between the EU and these third countries."
"Documentary film-makers and indeed some international NGOs have beaten a path to countries like Senegal and Mauritania in West Africa, intent on exposing the ravages of greedy European fishermen."
"Against a background of collapsing fish stocks in EU waters, due, allegedly, to massive over-fishing, these critics claim that Europe is now hell-bent on exporting its problems to these developing nations."
"Other critics point the finger at the ubiquitous Spanish and French fleets, claiming that such third country agreements, although funded by the EU, are only of benefit to Spain and France."
"It is time to set the record straight, and the Cunha report sets out to do this. Firstly, we should explore why the EU finds it necessary to enter into such agreements for international fishing rights."
"When Spain joined the EU it brought with it a distant water fleet of heavy trawlers, which had plied the world's oceans for centuries."
"Having only a narrow continental shelf and with limited fisheries resources of their own, Basque and Galician fishermen were catching cod off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador five hundred years before Christopher Columbus 'discovered' America."
"France has a similar tradition."
"However, just as fast as EU fish stocks are collapsing, stocks of migrating fish are being savagely cut as a result of the new regulations that we are imposing through the common fisheries policy."
"At the same time, consumer demand for fish in the EU is rising."
"We are now only 60% self-sufficient in meeting this demand."
"Consumers are turning away from red meats because of fears about BSE, foot-and-mouth and other scare stories, and are turning to fish as a healthy alternative."
"To meet this surging demand, the EU has two alternatives."
"Either it can import fish from outside the Community, increasing our balance of trade deficit and exporting valuable fishing jobs, or we can harness the expertise of the Community's distant water fleet which may well be largely Spanish and French, thus maintaining EU employment in the fisheries sector while, at the same time, ensuring that EU hygiene and food safety standards are maintained."
"The choice is not difficult."
"Nevertheless, while contracts entered into with third countries have seen EU trawlers from Spain, Portugal, France, Ireland and, to a lesser extent Greece and the UK, deployed around the globe from the Southern Oceans to the North Pole, there has been rising concern at the exploitative nature of some of these agreements."
"In Mauritania, off the West Coast of Africa, it was claimed that Spanish trawlers were hoovering up thousands of tonnes of fish, depleting local stocks, driving native fishermen out of work and causing famine amongst the coastal communities."
"That is why the EU had to develop a new system for drawing up these agreements."
"In future, third country agreements must be a partnership between the EU and the contracting nation, embracing a continuous monitoring process to ensure that a sustainable fishery is maintained."
"We want a significant proportion of the contract price to be devoted to buying fishing rights."
"But, and this is equally as important, we also want a significant contribution to be devoted to conservation and development objectives, with monitoring and surveillance high on the list."
"The EU has recognised its responsibility to the countries with whom we enter into these agreements, while at the same time maintaining its long tradition of distant water fishing to keep a steady supply of good, healthy fish on Europe's tables."
"– Mr President, if I may, I too will begin by stressing Mr Cunha’s excellent qualities as a Member of this House and as a citizen of Europe. I would also like to emphasise how much he will be missed in this Parliament, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in the Committee on Fisheries."
"I might add that I wish him every success with his duties in his senior position in the government of a great Portuguese region, the North."
"Even though I am a member of a different political party from Mr Cunha, furthermore, I do not have the problem of which the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Struan Stevenson, complained here. Since he is not a member of the UK Labour Party, Mr Stevenson distanced himself from UK Government policy."
"I do not have the same problem, but that is just a question of style: the British style on the one hand and, on the other, the Portuguese, Iberian style."
"If I may, moreover, Mr President, I would like to begin by underlining how correct and balanced I believe Mr Cunha’s report, as well as the Commission communication, to be. I wish I could be as reserved as Commissioner Fischler, who to all intents and purposes confined himself to expressing his agreement with the report, which he felt endorsed the content of the Commission communication."
"That much is true."
"There does not seem to be any major disagreement between us on this matter."
"I would say that the European Union has developed a very interesting type of diplomacy in the field of fisheries. As Mr Stevenson also said, that diplomacy has led to a very interesting and very original model for fisheries agreements, one which we might even consider exemplary and which could quite happily act as a model for distant water fisheries negotiations between other countries."
"That diplomacy should continue to develop freely, I would argue, with a view to upholding the interests of the European Union’s distant water fleet."
"This fleet must not be considered as belonging to Portugal, or to Spain, or to France: rather, it should be understood to be a European Union fleet, since the Commission is our only spokesperson, our only representative in these international relationships."
"Mr President, I support Mr Cunha’s report, as well as the content of the Commission’s text."
"I hope that distant water fishing in the European Union will continue to develop along the three axes of the conservation of resources, support for the poorest communities and also equal treatment for those working in the fishing industry."
"To conclude, I would say that we must combat illegal fishing and flags of convenience, which are, at times, the worst enemies of genuine fishing and fishermen."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Cunha for producing such a worthwhile report and by wishing him well in his new role."
"Our debate takes place in a context where, first, some stocks in certain northern waters are in crisis and others are endangered."
"Second, many more are being over-exploited on a global basis."
"In addition, a report published last week by the International Food Policy Research Institute indicates that, if China is included, developing countries now account for more than 70% of the production of fish for food including both wild fisheries and aquaculture."
"The consequences are that the EU is dependent on imports of fish and that many EU fishers pursue their activities in other waters."
"The ELDR accepts, therefore, that there is merit in negotiating fisheries partnership agreements with third countries, rather than leaving matters to bilateral arrangements which may lack consistency both between each other and in supporting the requirements of sustainable development."
"We do, however, have very strong views about the nature of any agreements made by the EU."
"First, the agreements reached should be genuine partnership ones and of mutual benefit."
"We believe that our amendment to paragraph 7 gives fuller expression to this idea than the original paragraph."
"Second, the agreement should be both responsible and transparent in budgetary terms, so we have amendments calling for renewal of agreements to be dependent on evidence that past monies have been spent as intended."
"We also call for an equitable - that is just to say a fair or just - sharing of payments by the EU vessel owners involved."
"On paragraph 11, whilst it may be right to forecast an increase in the number of agreements reached, we cannot be certain of this and would prefer by oral amendment to replace the words 'the increase' with 'any increase'."
"Third, the agreement should promote sustainability."
"We are pleased with the extent to which the report makes reference to the principles involved and hope to see these built on where the details of any future agreement are concerned, notably by introducing specific provisions for protecting the environment."
"I would urge the House to support both this report and their amendments to it."
"As Mr Stevenson has already said, we must ensure that we do not try to solve our domestic problems by exporting them to developing countries."
"Experience already tells us just how counterproductive such an approach would be."
"Indeed, wherever we come from in the EU we have a very strong interest in ensuring the sustainability of fisheries not only in our own waters but beyond."
"– Mr President, I would like to add to the congratulations directed at Mr Cunha and to the praise for his work in the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"With regard to this report, I would like to say that international fisheries agreements are undoubtedly a highly important aspect of the common fisheries policy, since they ensure that fishing activity is maintained in many regions of the European Union, and provide direct employment for 30 000 people. They help reduce the Community trade deficit in fish products and account for more than 20% of all Community catches."
"For these reasons, we should give this report our full support."
"Studies indicate that every euro invested in these fishing agreements generates economic activity to the value of three euros, meaning that the benefits clearly outweigh the costs."
"It is important, therefore, to improve and enhance this area, even taking account of the conclusions of the Fisheries Council of October 1997, which has been mentioned here already."
"This is even more important, moreover, given that there are those who would cast doubt on these agreements."
"I would like to remind you, however, that the Commission should take account of certain important aspects of these agreements. One of those central questions is that of appropriate funding."
"While coherence is certainly needed between the common fisheries policy and development policy, it should not be forgotten that these agreements are essentially commercial in nature: though they should take the development angle into account, the funding for these fishing agreements should come from the fisheries sector, while funding for development policies should derive from elsewhere in the Community budget – from increased amounts for cooperation and development, to be more precise."
"More partnership agreements should be developed, therefore, balancing the interests of the various countries and parts of the fleet concerned in an equitable way."
"I would like to conclude by echoing the rapporteur’s statement that it beggars belief that different conditions should apply under agreements within the European Union: under certain agreements, the vessel owners pay fishing licence fees, while under others they pay nothing."
"This problem, therefore, must be resolved urgently, as must the issue of paper quotas and the opportunity for unused fishing rights to be temporarily transferred."
"I hope that our support for Mr Cunha’s report will also convince the Commission to take equal note of the proposals he presents in the course of his work."
"Mr President, we have heard tonight about how the Commission has actually changed its position in relation to developing a new system of fisheries agreements."
"It is all very well just changing the name of 'fisheries agreements' to 'partnership agreements', which sounds very good."
"'Partnership' sounds like something that is fair and equitable, but, at the end of the day, what we need to see is that this is what actually happens."
"At the moment we are only talking about discussion documents from the Commission and when I hear some of the other speakers talking about trade diplomacy, we have to be very careful that this is not about coercion."
"When we talk about fisheries agreements, looking at Mr Cunha's report and comparing it with one we may have seen five or six years ago in this Parliament, it is better."
"However, if you look at the underlying majority view of the Committee on Fisheries and, indeed, of this Parliament, it is that the purpose of agreements is to supply European consumers with fish and to keep European fishermen in work."
"Any other consideration is secondary."
"This is not acceptable."
"We cannot talk about sustainability and development as two separate items."
"As regards exporting our problem in relation to overcapacity within the European Union, this has been the tradition up until now: fisheries agreements have been used to export our excess capacity to other parts of the world."
"When we talk about the countries that are benefiting, I know that when I first came to this Parliament, Ireland was not one of these countries."
"It clearly is now."
"Irrespective of what countries are benefiting from within the European Union, what we need to look at is how the developing countries are actually benefiting."
"I do not see anything yet to prove that the European Union has not merely a sustainable approach to fisheries agreements, but also an approach that takes into account the concerns of the developing countries."
"We have an agreement at the moment that there will be a separation in relation to payments."
"This will distinguish the development aspect from the other aspects of the fisheries agreements."
"But that is not enough."
"We need to get proof from the Commission that this is what is going to happen, because it is completely unfair to talk about fair trade, an equitable approach to developing countries while at the same time using developing countries by exporting our capacity to those countries."
"We have to take that into account."
"Finally, we have to take into account what happened with Morocco."
"Are our European taxpayers' monies going, in the future, to pay for the collapse of other fisheries agreements?"
"I am talking in particular of Mauritania."
"This is something that needs to be taken into account."
"Developing countries are not going to take for granted the situation that has been put to them with the only choice they have."
"We have to live up to our responsibilities and cut down on our excess capacity."
"Mr President, I am amazed to hear Struan Stevenson use the argument that we have to have these deals to maintain the historical fishing piracy of Spain and France."
"The world changed in 1976, as the empty ports of Hull and Grimsby can testify."
"We would not even be having this debate if it were not for the total, abject failure of the CFP and the need for more and more waters."
"And yet, as early as 1994, the warnings from Senegal were there for all to see, at least for those who wanted to."
"These deals have caused havoc and destruction, both environmentally and socially, in some of the poorest parts of the world."
"What is the response from the Commission?"
"It is the use of this wonderful word 'partnership', which, as yet, means nothing."
"But the Commission's spin goes a bit further than that."
"It says that if it were not the EU doing it, then it would be private enterprise, and there would be somebody out there who is 'worse than us'."
"I have seen Kenya, where private enterprises have been causing problems, but in my view two wrongs do not make a right."
"Perhaps the only good news is that a growing number of Members here are beginning to wake up to what these deals really mean and the opposition in this Parliament is now up to over 100."
"In England, we regard the maritime blind eye that was turned by Nelson to be an act of bravery and honour."
"But this is not the case with Commissioner Fischler, who continues to turn a blind eye."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Cunha report rightly emphasises the enormous economic importance, for both the Member States of the Union and the partner States, of the twenty-one international fisheries agreements concluded by the Community."
"Whereas the European Union faces a large shortfall in the increasing amount of fish it consumes and has to import almost half of that amount, the fisheries agreements alone provide one-fifth of total Community catches, worth around EUR one billion and constitutes a particularly significant source of employment both for European countries that have a tradition of distant fishing and for their overseas partners."
"This production takes place under controlled, supervised and responsible conditions, giving European consumers solid guarantees of traceability and of fishing methods that are vastly superior to those provided by third-country imports."
"These fisheries agreements, which serve a commercial purpose, are a good investment for the Union and those who wish to call into question the appropriateness of these agreements and halt their progress would do well to take a close look at the study produced by the Ifremer Institute, which proves that every euro we invest in this framework generates economic activity worth three times as much."
"The economic balance-sheet is also broadly positive for the partner countries."
"Investment must therefore be pursued, and even taken further, particularly in the framework our network of tuna agreements."
"As rapporteur for the EU-Mauritius agreement, I have been able to assess the scale of the mutual economic interests involved in this key sector that those working in the field in Europe have developed with a number of ACP partners in the Indian Ocean and with Latin American partners."
"These agreements are a source of supply and of processing activity for European countries and a source of jobs and development for partner countries, and must consequently be supported and extended."
"When the Commission talks about the coherence that is needed between the various Community policies, it must ensure in particular coherence between the common fisheries policy and trade policy."
"Hence a misjudged concession made at the WTO on tinned tuna imports in the context of a general removal of customs tariffs, could undermine years of effort and investment, destroy a mutually beneficial sector and lead to relocations that heavily penalise our partners first of all and then us."
"I therefore wish to draw the Commission’s attention, Mr President, to this issue, as our Assembly did when it adopted the amendment I tabled during the vote on my report on the agreement with Mauritius."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by expressing my best wishes to Mr Cunha; may they go home with him on his new political journey."
"Let me follow that up with an old adage – not to say an old truth – to the effect that Europe has too few fish; the waters around the Member States cannot meet our demand for them."
"That is a fact, and it is one with which we have to deal."
"Let me take this opportunity to emphasise the fundamental point that we have not started by emptying European waters of fish, only to seek out new fishing grounds in which to do the same thing."
"It is far more a case of traditional European fishing grounds having been lost as a result of the extension of the exclusive economic zones to 200 nautical miles, which happened as long ago as the 1970s."
"It is in order to compensate for this loss that the EU has concluded fisheries agreements with third states."
"Today, we have twenty-one of these agreements with countries in both the North and the South."
"The contribution they make to Europe’s economy is an important one; it might even be described as irreplaceable."
"We, for our part, get the fresh fish that we urgently need, whilst important jobs are safeguarded at home and abroad in the fishing and fish-processing industries."
"With such a resource as fish, though, a resource that is finite and sensitive to adverse environmental factors, economic considerations must not obscure environmental ones or blind us to conditions in the third countries."
"That is why I very much welcome the Commission’s new joint approach."
"I also believe that it needs to be brought to life, and it is more compatible with our objective of sustainable fisheries."
"The agreement is nonetheless concerned with a commercial activity, that is to say, simply with fishing in foreign waters and with the economic yield derived from it."
"I take the view that the amount of funding should reflect the real value of the fishing rights."
"Fisheries policy should not be used to cloak the objectives of development policy."
"That is what we have specific budget lines for, and that is why I am not the only one to take this line."
"I would like to see fisheries agreements in the future too – modern and sustainable ones, founded on partnership – but the benefits and burdens must be shared out fairly among all parties."
"Furthermore, we cannot look at these things from the perspective of using European money to provide permanent subsidies, if only a few Member States end up reaping the rewards."
"Nor should we forget the decisive point that Parliament must be better informed in view of the large amounts expended from the European Budget."
"Indeed, I take the view – and I am certainly not the only one to do so – that Parliament must have a part to play in negotiations, not tomorrow, but today."
"This is where something, at last, needs to be done!"
"Mr President, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, in his absence and wish him well in his new job."
"Third-party fishing agreements have come under a lot of scrutiny recently, with headlines such as 'EU fishing fleets devastate Third World' and 'West African nations to ban EU fishing fleets'."
"A recent WWF report highlighting the problems in Angola makes for interesting reading."
"On the one hand, the EU is providing emergency aid to Angola but, on the other, has signed a fishing agreement which would take from Angolan waters vital fish stocks which go to some of the poorest people in the world."
"According to UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme, which focused on Mauritania, Argentina and Senegal, all countries have noticed a depletion in their stocks after signing third-party fishing agreements."
"In Mauritania, catches of octopus have halved in the past four years and in Senegal two thirds of the country's export earnings are reliant on fish exported to Europe."
"Over half the fish we consume in the EU now comes from outside the EU and half of this is on the basis of third-party fishing agreements."
"Of primary concern is the subsequent depletion of fish stocks, the dependence of local communities in developing countries on these stocks for their own food, the poor enforcement rules and catch limits and the apparent contradictions that seem to exist between the EU fisheries policy and EU development policy."
"All these issues concern many MEPs."
"The need for environmental impact to be taken into consideration with third-party fishing agreements is paramount."
"I like the fact that the rapporteur has underlined the importance of sustainable fisheries and is highlighting this fact, which should apply to all vessels within the waters affected."
"However, I regret that, for example, in Angola where 35% of the EUR 15.5 million paid is supposed to go towards small-scale fisheries projects, it is actually unclear if this money will go to this aim or not."
"These concerns are very real and that is why I support the ELDR's Amendment No 2."
"This amendment would make new fishing agreements dependent upon the presentation of satisfactory evidence that monies paid under the previous agreements for targeted measures have been spent as intended."
"We should not be seen to be renewing agreements where the third party has not fulfilled their side of the bargain."
"However, fishing agreements should not be signed if they would be detrimental to the long-term socio-economic interests of the country concerned."
"Third-party fishing agreements play an important role in providing the EU with fish."
"However, what are we going to do when their fish stocks run out?"
"We should not be destroying the viability of countries and crucial stocks for the future for short-term gain."
"Third-party fishing agreements must take into account the future viability of stocks."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I would just like to start by warmly thanking all those who have spoken in this debate for their constructive contributions."
"My concluding remarks can be relatively brief."
"In particular, I would also like to express my gratitude for the great deal of support that our report has received."
"The one thing that has to be clear is that we cannot apply double standards."
"The principles that we in the Community apply to our own Community waters must also apply in agreements with third states."
"That is particularly the case when a sensible and effective conservation policy is needed, but also when seeking to ensure that any decisions taken are based upon current best knowledge."
"It is by these principles that we want to be guided in future."
"What do we actually mean by a partnership agreement?"
"A partnership exists when, to coin a phrase, the parties to it can meet on the level, with neither dominating the other."
"That is what we intend to ensure in future."
"This is about cooperating not only when we want to fish in a third state’s waters; it is, moreover, about us playing our part and working with these countries to enable them – provided that they have an interest in this – to build up their own fishing industries, not only as regards the catching of fish but also its processing."
"This is an essential aspect of the development that we want to promote – as we indeed should."
"All this, of course, can only work if these states are wholeheartedly interested and collaborate fully, but we are discovering in practice that such is increasingly the case, and so I can see our concluding of these agreements developing a very positive way."
"I can only say that these principles must be put to the test in concrete negotiations, when Parliament, too, will have the opportunity to ascertain whether or not every one of these newly-concluded agreements comes up to scratch."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fischler."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.(1)"
"The next item is the statements by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission on the Middle East."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you once again for giving me the opportunity of coming before a plenary sitting of the House."
"I am here to address you on what is currently a highly topical issue, namely the Middle East. I know this is an area of great concern to you all."
"The Middle East is giving us cause for alarm once again."
"Yesterday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted the report drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle."
"This sent out a further signal of Parliament’s strong determination to be actively involved in the peace effort."
"I am confident this report will be most helpful in the search for peace."
"It has indeed already proved its worth."
"I have held several discussions with Mr Menendez del Valle."
"We worked together to ensure the report contained the elements that could help to find a solution in line with the European approach."
"It was shattered dramatically by the events of recent days. We have received yet another reminder of the extent to which tension, violence, destruction and death are part of daily life in the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am bound to admit to you that I too am overcome by a feeling of frustration."
"I am frustrated because the Middle East is still bleeding to death. Life after life is still being lost needlessly."
"I am frustrated also because the Israelis and Palestinians have been unable or unwilling to meet the solemn undertakings given at Aqaba a few short weeks ago."
"I am frustrated because tension in the region has risen to alarming levels."
"I am frustrated because fewer and fewer people now believe the solution lies in the Road Map sponsored by the Quartet."
"Above all, I am frustrated because the despair that has overcome so many Arabs and Israelis might also take root amongst us. It might overcome our political leaders and our citizens too."
"It is imperative not to allow this frustration to cloud our vision."
"On the contrary, the very gravity of the situation and our shared concern must spur us on to greater efforts. They should motivate us to remain on the alert and assume all our duties and responsibilities."
"Each and every one of us is wondering what further action can be taken."
"We are asking ourselves if there is anything more the Union can do, and whether the Road Map retains any validity."
"We are also concerned that the present situation might degenerate into a regional conflict."
"All these concerns have been raised in public and no doubt in private too."
"I should now like to take a few minutes to deal with each in turn."
"I will begin with the Road Map."
"I believe the concern expressed is justified."
"It could certainly be argued that there is little point to a programme of actions to be taken on specific dates, if the parties required to act are disinclined to do so."
"It is certainly true that without the commitment of all the parties, progress will be negligible."
"I must also state quite clearly that whilst I recognise the tremendous difficulties confronting us, I do not believe there is any alternative to the Road Map."
"The much longed-for and shared objective of ensuring that two states, Israel and Palestine, can live in peace and security must not be abandoned following the tragic events of recent days."
"The Road Map sets an ambitious objective."
"It is to be met in 2005 when both the aforementioned states should be in existence."
"Still greater involvement by the international community is therefore called for, if that were possible. Above all, the onus is on the Quartet to step up its efforts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe sponsored the Road Map initiative."
"Europe was also involved in devising and setting up the Quartet."
"We proved capable of creating a new political platform to facilitate direct involvement by the United States within the framework of joint action."
"The debate over who might be an honest brokerwas defused."
"The members of the Quartet met in New York a few days ago."
"I can assure you that despite recent gloomy prognostications, the Quartet is still active. It remains the focal point for all peace efforts."
"Members of the Quartet formally undertook to meet again before the end of this year. An announcement to that effect was made at the end of the meeting."
"As a result of pressure from Europe, it was also agreed that the special representatives should meet regularly. These individuals are resident in the area."
"They are therefore in the best position to provide Members of the Quartet with an overview of the situation, so that the appropriate joint measures may be taken. Closer cooperation of our efforts will also be fostered."
"A mere declaration of the continuing validity of the Road Map will not suffice, ladies and gentlemen."
"Specific actions are required if the current stalemate is to be transcended. Each party would then be able to detect in the other a willingness to move forward."
"Such measures need to be designed to build a minimum of confidence, and they must be verifiable."
"During the drafting stages of the Road Map, past experience led us to insist on the need for a verification mechanism."
"It is now urgent for the latter to be operational as soon as possible."
"Mr Abu Ala, the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, is likely still to be working on the formation of a new Palestinian Government, probably in extremely trying conditions. He might have succeeded by now."
"I have known Mr Ala for several years and respect him."
"Mr Ala has built up a wealth of experience in very difficult circumstances."
"This new Palestinian Government must assume its responsibilities at the earliest opportunity."
"I have spoken to Mr Ala by telephone almost every day."
"There is absolutely no doubt that, as regards security, Mr Ala must begin by bringing order to the Palestinian security services. He would be following the lead of Mr Salam Fayad, the minister responsible for the financial sector."
"Mr Fallad has done a good job in bringing order to the latter. Horrific terrorist attacks of the kind perpetrated all too often against the citizens of Israel with such devastating consequences simply cannot be tolerated."
"The attack in Haifa on the eve of Yom Kippur is a further example of what must never again be allowed to happen."
"The Palestinian Government needs to put an end to this scourge, in the interests of the Palestinians themselves."
"Likewise, economic and social reform must continue, for the benefit of the people of Palestine."
"Europe will offer Mr Ala and his government strong and active support for such efforts."
"If the efforts of the new Palestinian Government are to bear fruit, however, it is vitally important for it to be able to count first and foremost on the support of the Israeli Government."
"There are also a number of key obligations on the Israeli Government pursuant to the Road Map. Israel is required to put an end to its policy on settlements."
"It is also required to stop building the security wall. This wall encroaches into territory beyond the 1967 borders."
"Further, Israel is called upon to put an end to its policy of targeted killings. In addition, Israel is called upon to stop other practices we believe to be violations of international law."
"Israelis and Palestinians need a chance to renew cooperation."
"I cannot conclude without saying a few words on regional stability."
"There should be no doubt as to the determination of the European Union, its Member States, institutions and citizens to combat and condemn terrorism. The Israeli Government is entitled to take measures to protect its citizens from terrorism."
"Indeed it is its duty to do so. Nonetheless, if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively, it must be dealt with within the framework of international law."
"That is the bottom line."
"The Middle East is a very volatile part of the world. Action by the parties involved must be such that it reduces rather than increases tension."
"Our Arab friends are also called upon to maintain their commitment to the peace effort."
"They should also reactivate the initiative launched by Saudi Arabia and formalised at the Beirut Arab League Summit in March of last year."
"That initiative remains valid and enjoys the full support of the Quartet."
"Clearly, the next few weeks will be decisive."
"It is essential for all members of the Quartet to remain committed to the process in the days to come. This applies in particular to the United States."
"The road to peace will be long and difficult."
"That has already become apparent."
"We know what the objective is and are aware of the difficulties to be encountered on the way."
"The European Union must continue to take strong and decisive action in the Middle East."
"Its actions also need to be creative and consistent."
"As I said earlier, the next few days and weeks will be crucial. Peace will have another chance, if Prime Minister Ala’s government gets to work and discharges its responsibilities regarding security, and if the Israeli Government is able to demonstrate restraint and generosity so as to reduce tension."
"It is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists."
"For our part, ladies and gentlemen, we shall do all in our power to move the process on as you and all men and women of good will would wish."
"We remain in touch with all the parties on a daily basis."
"It is to be hoped that the present vicious circle can be broken."
"The European Union’s personal representative is in the region every day. We are doing all we can to prevent violence increasing and spiralling out of control."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all realise the difficulty of the task before us. Nonetheless, it is essential for us to continue to work day and night to prevent the situation worsening until there can be no possible solution."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, has just explained, the political situation in the Middle East has reached a very low point."
"Apart from the difficulty in implementing the Roadmap so as to find a way out of the dreadful situation in which the Middle East has been plunged for some time now, new threats are looming on the horizon."
"Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, however, we must look to the future, find out why we have failed and take remedial action."
"If we accept that the two-state solution still has the widest support, despite the building of the wall, despite the settlement problem and despite the attacks by Hamas, then the Roadmap needs to be put back on track."
"Perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen, whereby the toughest issues are left until last, should be rethought."
"Solving the difficult problems first – like refugees and territorial division – may help to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of peace."
"Best practice acquired throughout the world may shed some light on how to approach the non-negotiable issues."
"As Mr Menéndez del Valle has observed in his draft report, any peace plan depends on the honest commitment of both sides – and, I would add, of the international community – to implement it."
"It is this commitment that currently seems to be lacking: we therefore have to re-establish the political will to make the two-state solution work."
"On the Israeli side, polls show that the majority of the population favour the two-state solution, although, according to many observers, a large part of the current Israeli Government will not accept the creation of a genuine Palestinian state on the West Bank."
"This rejection of the two-state solution and the failure to implement the Roadmap seem to be based on ideological reasons or on security fears."
"Building the wall, the security barrier, which runs deep inside the West Bank, is a consequence of both schools of thought, but it does not solve the concerns that lie at the root of either one."
"Both Palestinians and Israelis will, in fact, be left on both sides of the dividing line, many Palestinians will be subjected to great humanitarian suffering and some of the settlements will be left on the other side of the wall."
"The European Union has always recognised Israel’s right to defend itself, but security does not consist solely of preventing terrorists from carrying out their abhorrent attacks; first and foremost, it is a matter of winning the people’s hearts and minds."
"Building a wall may be an acceptable measure, provided it is kept within Israeli territory."
"Israel now has to adopt a sufficient number of measures to strengthen trust."
"All extrajudicial executions and all punitive demolition of homes must stop."
"All outlying settlements on Palestinian land built since September 2000 must be pulled down, and all activities carried on in them must stop, since they are obstacles to the two-state solution."
"On the Palestinian side, the government seems to believe in the two-state solution, which means accepting the creation of a Palestinian state on the 1967 land; among the people and opposition groups, however, rejection of this solution is gaining ground."
"Hamas and others do not recognise Israel’s right to exist, as shown by the terrible suicide attacks and other terrorist acts."
"In addition, there seems to be a growing lack of any ability, power or willingness to set up efficient institutions, especially in the security field."
"The new government under Prime Minister Abu Ala must take effective control of the Palestinian territories, undertake clear action against those who organise and commit violent attacks on the Israeli population, and publicly reaffirm Israel’s right to exist."
"It is equally important to make resolute progress on preparing for the elections, drafting the constitution and involving civil society in the reforms."
"It is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue, but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms."
"This is an important aspect, and we should not lose sight of it."
"Having institutions that work well is the basis for long-term stability and security for both Palestine and Israel."
"The international community should be more decisive in setting targets against which the results achieved by both parties can be measured, in effectively monitoring all areas and not just that of security, and in offering rapid, effective support from donors."
"Is there any hope?"
"Both Israelis and Palestinians have to be persuaded that they have something to gain by moving on from today’s terrible situation."
"Both sides have signed up to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to a guarantee of secure borders for the state of Israel, not to mention full acceptance of Israel by all countries in the region."
"The international community must now do everything it can to persuade, coax and put pressure on both sides to honour the commitments they have made."
"– Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we face a very tragic situation in the Middle East."
"We all thought that after the Iraq War, more intensive efforts would be made to find a solution to this apparently unending Middle East conflict."
"Unfortunately, this hope has not become reality."
"We appear to be in a situation of hopelessness, and the spiral of violence is continuing to escalate."
"On behalf of our group, I would like to state very clearly that every suicide bombing is a crime against the young people who carry it out and a crime against the Israelis whom they take with them into death."
"This must be made very clear."
"We also say, however, that the ‘selective murder’ response, as Mr Solana has said – the policy of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ – does not help to make peace possible."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Monti for what he said about the wall, for his great ability – we know he has other abilities as well – but I would particularly like to thank him for saying what he did, and for the way he said it."
"I would like to thank him very warmly for that. If you would permit me to make a personal remark, I can trace my political commitment back to when, at the start of 1962, I saw a wall in my own country."
"That is something that profoundly affects people’s hearts and spirits."
"I am profoundly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy."
"It is a tragedy for Israel too, because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion."
"It is not a measure that will genuinely promote peace, and in my view, the wall will not increase Israel’s security either."
"It must also be said that the illegal settlements are an ongoing factor preventing a peaceful solution."
"Let me say, not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of my parliamentary group, that if a wall is constructed which leads to more hatred and more humiliation, this is a further argument, to my mind, for having an international peacekeeping force to keep the two hostile parties apart."
"I hope that a debate will begin, for once, about whether an international peacekeeping force …"
"… involving Europeans would be a way forward."
"From our point of view, it is clear that the aim must be for Israel to exist in secure borders. The aim must also be a Palestinian state in secure borders."
"We call on the key actors – Prime Minister Sharon, President Arafat, and the new Prime Minister Abu Ala – to give peace a chance and to overcome what are perhaps personal dislikes."
"Dialogue is essential, and Mr Solana, I would like to thank you particularly for what you are doing."
"I believe you really are doing what you have described, and that you are working day and night and talking to the key actors."
"Now, of course, the development must continue."
"As desperate as the situation may appear, human and political life is never entirely hopeless, for if it were, we would have to give up our efforts altogether."
"For this reason, a further effort is required from the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia to ensure that the actors on both sides start talking to each other again."
"Perhaps we have an even greater responsibility than our American friends."
"After all, we always demand a great deal from the Americans."
"We criticise them when they do something and we criticise them when they do not."
"As Europeans, we should now, for once, take the initiative, especially since our American friends have other concerns with the start of the presidential election campaign – and we know how important are the groups in America whose support a candidate needs in order to be elected."
"We Europeans should therefore launch a genuine initiative here."
"Let me conclude by saying something that especially concerns the issue of human dignity."
"There are no second-class people."
"Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal in human dignity."
"This applies to the Europeans, it applies to the Americans, it applies to the Palestinians, it applies to the Israelis, and it applies to the Chechens and to everyone in the world."
"In the European Union, we are currently in the process of adopting a constitution, and this constitution is a process underpinned by values."
"I think we would do well to make people the focal point, and that is why we must adopt initiatives at this time to ensure that the dignity of the Palestinians is respected and the dignity of the Israelis is respected and that both nations have the chance to move into the future together in peace, in a democratic system. We should play a strong and pro-active role in this context."
"I would like to thank Mr Solana very warmly for all that he has contributed to date, and I hope that we will be more successful in future than we have been so far."
"Mr President, I have just heard the sad news of the murder of Mr Jose Antonio Bernal Gomez, Press Attaché at the Spanish Embassy in Baghdad. I trust you will convey the deepest condolences of the House to the Government of Spain."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would also like to express our condemnation of the Haifa attack."
"This attack took place at a particularly sensitive time for Israel, coming as it did on the eve of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement."
"We express our condolences to all those Israeli and Palestinian families suffering as a result of this escalation of violence. This has come about despite the resumption of dialogue on 30 April, which represented a glimmer of hope and a window of opportunity."
"We endorse the content of the Menendez del Valle report."
"It is worth highlighting that, although there are differences of opinion and divisions amongst us Europeans on a number of matters, the Middle East is one issue on which we are broadly in agreement."
"This consensus between all the Member States of the European Union dates back to the 1980 Venice Declaration."
"The broad support for these proposals in the House is also worth noting."
"Further to the statements made by Mr Solana and Commissioner Monti, I believe there is also clear agreement that we must maintain our political, diplomatic and economic effort. Mr President, the issue is not whether the Road Map is valid or not."
"The issue is that we must go down the road to peace, however difficult and dangerous it proves. After all, the Road Map is simply a way or a means of achieving peace."
"In this connection, we believe we should make it clear to our Israeli friends that terrorism has to be dealt with within the framework of international law."
"The attack on Syria in the wake of the terrorist incident is unacceptable under international law. It violates the territorial integrity of a third country and contributes to a dangerous escalation of tension in a part of the world that could most certainly do without it."
"I also believe we should make it clear to the Israeli Government and to Mr Sharon that the solution to the conflict does not lie in implementing the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It does not lie either in calls for the murder or removal of the elected representative of the Palestinian people."
"I recently attended the celebrations at Tel Aviv University in honour of Shimon Peres’s eightieth birthday."
"Bearing in mind statements made by Mr Peres, statements by other prominent Israeli leaders and statements by Mr Arafat and by the Palestinian Authority, it appears a number of concessions have been made."
"I refer firstly to the recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist. This is recognition granted not only by us but also by the Palestinian Authority."
"Secondly, it has been recognised that peace can only be achieved through negotiation."
"Thirdly, it has been recognised that negotiations must be based on the 1967 borders. All this is to the credit of the Palestinian Authority."
"Mr Abu Abas represents this approach. He addressed the House when Mrs Fontaine was President, and was one of the negotiators of the Oslo Agreements."
"I would like to add also that the Palestinian National Authority could become a role model in democracy for the whole of the Arab world."
"I have in mind the activities it is currently engaged in and indeed the possibility of fresh elections, if the latter are permitted."
"In short, a hard intransigent approach leads to strengthening fanatic, anti-democratic and aggressive attitudes."
"I shall now turn to the matter of the building of the security fence. Mr Poettering spoke eloquently on the basis of his personal experience."
"I should point out too that from the Great Wall of China to the Berlin Wall, all such walls have proved utterly useless."
"We should appeal to the good sense of the Jewish people."
"They owe their very survival to the absence of walls."
"We must appeal to them to come to their senses and stop building a fence that does not even respect the 1967 borders. This fence will also make it impossible to achieve what we in the European Union have succeeded in doing, namely establishing a network of inter-connected interests."
"Links of this kind are just what the Middle East needs."
"They would result in fewer arms, greater opportunities for cooperation and economic development and greater opportunities for coming closer together."
"Finally, I would like to support the action taken by Mr Solana and also by our Representative in the Middle East."
"I believe the Quartet must continue its work."
"The possibility of establishing an international mandate involving the deployment of an international force on the ground should be considered too. This would be a peace-keeping buffer force supporting the efforts to be made by both parties."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the Road Map cannot be allowed to fail."
"Fanaticism, terrorism and intransigence cannot be allowed to ride roughshod over common sense and a just and dignified peace."
"I wish you well, gentlemen."
"You can count on our support."
"Mr President, I listened carefully to the statement by Mr Solana."
"Clearly, the Middle East is an area of major concern for us."
"Only this morning I was reading the , a Zurich daily with a fine reputation the world over. It contained an article calling for speedier distribution of funds to victims of the Holocaust."
"You may well wonder how these two issues are linked."
"They are linked because they both relate to an event that took place in Europe, and that event gave rise to the conflict in the Middle East we are debating today."
"In the same newspaper I read that the United States Congress is preparing to impose sanctions on Syria."
"Sanctions will certainly not help to improve the situation."
"That is not the way to put an end to conflicts."
"Two days ago, Mr Naser Yusuf, the nominee for Minister of Internal Affairs in Mr Abu Ala’s new government, refused to swear allegiance to Yasser Arafat."
"Mr Ariel Sharon acted in the same vein recently too. He declared he was ready to attack enemy targets wherever they might be."
"This is a threat. It imperils the very stability of the area as described by Mr Solana."
"Such a threat to the stability of the region will inevitably result in counter threats."
"In yesterday’s Syria was reported as stating that it is of course prepared to defend itself against any aggression."
"Clearly, the situation is particularly difficult and extremely complex."
"The European Parliament is preparing its position on the basis of the report drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle."
"I should like to focus on the first part of the report. In it, the Road Map is presented as the only possible solution to the current conflict."
"In this part of the report too, particular emphasis is placed on education for peace."
"Careful consideration should be given to the latter."
"There is some doubt as to whether education for peace really does exist amongst the Palestinian and Israeli people, or whether what actually exists is education for hatred."
"There is nothing to be gained from the latter. I believe this matter deserves attention."
"Discussion of what should happen following implementation of the Road Map and the ensuing peace conference is best left until the time comes."
"I believe it is too early to discuss issues such as Jerusalem, Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967 borders and refugees."
"There are other more urgent matters to deal with just now."
"In this connection, I should like to say a few words about the security fence."
"The sections built beyond the 1967 borders amount to an act of aggression."
"The sections on the borders may prove to be a mistake. Nonetheless, if it is instrumental in preventing the death of even a single victim, the fence will not have been built in vain."
"In conclusion, I should like to refer to an article by Mr Samuel Hadas. He was the first Ambassador of the State of Israel to the Kingdom of Spain and also to the Vatican City State."
"In his article, Mr Hadas maintains that the Quartet’s Road Map for the Middle East is the only way forward. He also states, however, that currently the way forward seems to lead into a maze from which there appears to be no way out."
"Mr Hadas concludes by stating that there will be no magic solutions."
"In his view the United States is the only power able to assist, or in other words, to pressurise the parties to get the peace process back on track."
"As an aside, I must say that in my opinion it is actually for the Quartet to apply pressure to the parties."
"Mr Hadas further states that until the United States and the international community understand that in the present circumstances Israelis and Palestinians are not in a position to get the peace process back on track themselves, both parties will continue to teeter on the brink of the abyss."
"I am convinced that the onus is on the international community and especially on the Quartet."
"I believe Parliament must support the Quartet and the European Union as they contribute to the Middle East peace process."
"– Actually, Mr President, I would rather not have spoken this morning; I would rather have kept silent, just like the Israeli women in black who have been silently saying ‘Stop the Israeli occupation’ ever since 1988."
"I have too much love and respect, however, for my group’s chairman, Mr Wurtz, who has asked me to speak, and for my colleagues, but, most of all, a symbolic gesture might not work here and so I will have to use words."
"I must say, Mr Solana, that I feel frustrated, embittered and, above all, highly indignant."
"Indignation is a political concept, not a state of mind, and I am indignant because, every day, I feel caught up in a spider’s web in which the law, justice, freedom and the truth suffocate and die every day: they perish in the Dance of Death performed by the Sharon government, Hamas and Islamic Jihad."
"On the one hand – and it is not trite or futile to repeat this – there is an army that is militarily occupying a country; on the other, there is international law, which is constantly being flouted and which we now repeat like a litany."
"International law should be obeyed, but not a single resolution is being obeyed."
"I have no hesitation in considering Hamas and Jihad to be enemies, even though, as I am non-violent, I have eliminated the concept of enemy."
"It is clearly criminal to send young people to kill themselves and others; those who do so are responsible for these deaths and I consider it a crime, but please let us also break out of this inertia, this diplomacy that causes more deaths every day and contributes to this crime."
"I feel responsible, together with you, all of you, for what is happening in that country, because it is not enough just to call for compliance with international law."
"Of course, it is a good thing to go there, and I, too, thank Mr Solana and I thank Mr Moratinos very much, although I have to say that, at the time of the Quartet, Marc Otte was, in fact, absent because of Ariel Sharon’s blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the Roadmap."
"We were not there at that moment, because we rightly recognised that Ariel Sharon had been legitimately elected."
"Yasser Arafat, too, was legitimately elected, and he cannot be accused of representing everything that is evil."
"He is not my leader – I am an autonomous, free-minded independent – but it must be admitted that Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years, and that is no minor matter."
"Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years and he certainly cannot be in military control of the Jenin area, where there are Israeli tanks, bulldozers and soldiers."
"He cannot."
"He can do what the government under Abu Mazen and now Abu Ala has been trying to do: to come to a political agreement with all the forces, including Hamas and Jihad, the moderate wing, let us say the wing that accepts peace or accepts a total cease-fire."
"Every time, however – it is not just a trivial thing to say: it really is true, and that is how it is – every time, some leaders get killed."
"This is of no small importance, and I am very grateful to Mr Poettering and I would not like him to feel embarrassed because the left likes him so much today or because I usually respond to problems in a cross-party way."
"I thought Mr Poettering’s speech was marvellous, to the point and perfect, even on the subject of the wall."
"Commissioner Monti, I think you should go and see the wall. As Mr Poettering said, the wall separates, destroys and kills freedom and the chance to communicate."
"That is not the state that people want to create for Palestinians and Israelis: we want a state in which Palestinians and Moslems communicate together."
"That wall is an obscenity, it is clear to everyone, I have seen it, I went to see it last Saturday."
"In Adudis, it cuts the whole village in half."
"An article in the Israeli newspaper, , by Gideon Levi, who is an amazing journalist, tells of how, in order to cross the road, children have to squeeze through the gaps in the concrete: their thin bodies get through but their schoolbags do not and they throw them over to the other side."
"It is an obscenity that must be stopped."
"Now, I am convinced that there are many things that can be done; I am also convinced that Parliament must take itself more seriously when it drafts and adopts resolutions."
"I am tired of writing resolutions and building bridges: the resolutions need to be enforced."
"We have been saying since time immemorial that we need to set up an arms embargo and that we need to verify the applicability of the association agreement; most importantly, we have decided on a high-level delegation (I have nearly finished) from Parliament."
"I believe we should do this; we should keep following the Roadmap, and there is a hope … I am sorry, Mr Cox;"
"I am sorry, everyone;"
"I have not written out my speech and so I have lost track of time, but I should like to say one more thing. There is a great hope in Palestine and in Israel: it is those thousands of Palestinians who endure every day and who do not agree with the bombs and the attacks, and those hundreds and thousands of Israelis who are fantastic, like the two pilots last week who were ordered to bomb Nablus and refused."
"They were over Nablus; the young men felt for the people and turned back; obviously they were suspended from duty."
"This is extremely important: it shows that a sense of humanity is growing, and we must make it grow within ourselves, in others and among Palestinians and Israelis."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe all of us are united on this issue, as demonstrated by the speeches of Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, and all of those who have spoken, up to and including Mrs Morgantini."
"That would be my first point."
"Secondly, listening to Mr Solana’s speech brought on feelings of despair, weariness, anger and a sense of powerlessness."
"If I may continue in the same vein as Mr Poettering, I believe that we in this Parliament should have the moral strength to question the assumption underlying the route map, which, as Mr Solana said, reflects the idea of gradual progress towards peace."
"That was the idea at Oslo and the idea that has been nurtured up to now. I do not believe, however, that this gradual approach is working any more."
"Is there any political alternative we can propose to this gradual approach?"
"Ami Ayalon and Sari Nusseibeh, respectively the former head of Israel’s security services and president of a Palestinian university, argued that we must state where we want to go, and create a political shock on that basis."
"If we were to take up their idea, what could the European Union propose by way of a political shock?"
"Here is my suggestion. The European Union, by which I mean all the European states with a voice on the Security Council, shall propose a solemn vote in the UN General Assembly on the Palestinian state, modelled on the idea of creating the Israeli state."
"The motion shall be that the Palestinian state shall receive the same rights and responsibilities as the Israeli state."
"After this motion has been approved, the European Union shall propose, through its representatives on the Security Council, that a UN military force be sent to keep the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian states."
"Firstly, the Security Council shall accept the European proposal for the immediate disarmament of all military forces in Palestine other than those of the Palestinian state."
"Secondly, the map of that state shall be redrawn along its 1967 borders. The Security Council shall then give both the Israeli state and the Palestinian state two, three or four months to disarm and to withdraw from Palestinian territory all colonists living outside Israel’s 1967 borders."
"Thirdly, the Security Council shall decide that any alterations to those borders should be negotiated and accepted by both sides. After a given deadline, the international community shall take responsibility for compelling any colonists who are not on the right side of the border to leave and for disarming any Palestinian terrorist groups who have not been disarmed by the Palestinian National Authority."
"Finally, the UN shall decide that Palestinian refugees shall be permitted to return only to Palestine, and Israeli – by which I mean Jewish – refugees only to Israel."
"What I am proposing, then, is that we administer a real political shock. If we do not do so, we will always remain in the same impasse, endowed with extraordinary moral strength, but powerless."
"Once and for all, we must seize an initiative which will have very harsh political and military consequences for us, but which is our only chance of helping the Palestinians and Israelis."
"– Mr President, who will take the risk of defying, let alone attempting to dismantle, the Palestinian terrorist organisations Hamas and Islamic Jihad?"
"Ahmed Quraya, the new prime minister in the Palestinian emergency cabinet that was sworn in on Tuesday, has himself said that he will not in any case."
"How, Mr Solana, do you respond to that, or is the Council remaining silent about its explicit demand that the Palestinian Authority should dismantle terrorist organisations within the areas under its control?"
"Who, too, will dare to give a real warning to the other countries that are stirring up conflict between Palestine and Israel, headed by Syria and Iran?"
"Instead of supporting Israel in this, prominent EU Member States are falling headlong upon the Jewish state."
"Not to mention European expressions of support to Syria, which, let it be noted, whilst being a member of the UN Security Council, has for years functioned as a training camp and base for Lebanese and Palestinian terrorist networks!"
"Is the European Union really going to enter into an association agreement with Syria, as Commissioner Patten very recently proposed in this House?"
"Do you share my view that Brussels is thereby sending a completely wrong political signal to such a violent region as this one?"
"Think of Haifa!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cohn-Bendit’s Roadmap could be quite attractive if people in this Parliament did not take such one-sided views."
"Very often, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian question, people see the problems on one side but often forget about those on the other."
"They forget, for instance, that the Palestinian constitution denies the existence of Israel; they forget that Palestinian school books teach that Israel does not exist and that its people do not exist and never have existed; they forget that, in 1999 or 2000, the Camp David initiative failed because of Yasser Arafat’s clumsiness at negotiating and accepting a compromise that might, perhaps, have resulted in a very different situation from the one we have today; they also forget everything about which we are quite rightly indignant, because we demand a lot from Israel, a democratic people, and we are also entitled to demand a lot from peoples that are not democratic but, we hope, will become so."
"Clearly, however, we can only conclude that what is happening is a response to attacks that society would normally be unable to tolerate but which have, however, become the daily bread of Israeli society."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is failing in its duty; it is unable to do its job despite the efforts of our High Representative, despite the efforts made in the Quartet."
"There is no doubt that Europe is stepping back, and, very often, this can be positive in hindsight, as has been the case over the last six months, when the Roadmap has not, I think, been altogether unanimously accepted by many European governments, which may have wanted to split the front so as not to accept the US line."
"Therefore, I believe that, if all this is true, we Europeans should also examine our consciences."
"If our outlook were more balanced, more pragmatic and more objective, we would not be seen by one of the sides involved as being of little consequence in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Mr President, I should like to endorse the request made to the President by a previous speaker. It would be appropriate for condolences to be sent to the victims in Haifa."
"I would also ask for our condolences to be sent to the family of Jose Manuel Bernal Gomez, the Spanish official accredited in Baghdad. All terrorism is reprehensible, regardless of its origin."
"This week the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted the report on the Middle East drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle. I should like to say here and now, in advance of the vote at the next part-session, how much I welcome the effort made by all the political groups to agree on compromise amendments."
"I am not sure how much bearing the document will have on the situation, though I am sure it will be less than we hope for. Nonetheless, I am quite sure European Parliament resolutions that do not enjoy the support of a substantial majority are meaningless."
"Be that as it may, I would like to point out that the willingness of all the parliamentary groups to reach an agreement underlines the critical nature of the situation."
"Everyone has lost out during the three years of the Intifada."
"The only winners have been the extremists and they have taken the debate onto their own violent ground."
"We certainly all agree that the quality of life of both Palestinians and Israelis is now worse than it was three years ago."
"Regardless of the method of comparison used, it is clear that both groups have lost out as regards social welfare, freedom and security."
"As I see it, it is simplistic and therefore useless to attempt to apportion blame to individuals on one or other side. I believe all those involved share the blame for the present situation."
"I agree with Mrs Morgantini on this. Obviously, we each have different views and sensitivities regarding the conflict."
"I am sure, however, that we all agree on our dislike of walls such as the so-called security wall."
"Undoubtedly, the Israeli Government does have a duty to defend its citizens against terrorism, but this is not the best way to do so."
"I believe we are all of one mind as regards condemnation of targeted killings. We are all alarmed too at the danger of the conflict spreading to neighbouring countries."
"Further, I believe we all agree that we would like to see in place a Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority who would be willing and able to act against terrorist organisations and put an end to them. Control of the security forces is required, obviously."
"We are as yet unsure how the government being formed by Mr Abu Ala will fare. His track record has earned him the support of the House."
"I would ask honourable Members to take a moment to reflect on how they might be feeling if during the last three years terrorist attacks had become almost weekly events in their countries, and if these attacks had caused nearly 500 civilian victims."
"I therefore believe we must continue to back the Quartet."
"There is currently no alternative to the Road Map, and the European Union’s foreign policy needs to be supported."
"We must believe in ourselves."
"We would all prefer the Union’s foreign policy to have more resources at its disposal and enjoy greater visibility."
"We would also like it to be able to call on a joint diplomatic service. Nonetheless, the Union’s foreign policy does sometimes have more influence than we might think."
"This is particularly so in the case of the Middle East."
"– Mr President, Mr Solana was kind enough to say he had devoted a good deal of time to my report. I should first like to thank him for doing so."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his kind words."
"I broadly endorse Mr Poettering’s remarks also. They provide an indication of the degree of consensus reached."
"The title of the report I have been privileged to draft refers to peace and dignity in the Middle East. I chose these two words deliberately, because I think they provide a clear indication of how things stand and what we need to aim at."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights Common Security and Defence Policy adopted this report by a broad majority. I am therefore now in a position to have the pleasure of speaking on this text on behalf of the committee, not just as a socialist."
"It is worth mentioning that the report does enshrine a broad consensus on a number of key issues. This consensus was referred to earlier in the House."
"We are of course united too in our condemnation of terrorism. Nonetheless, we are adamant that the peace process must not be blocked or put in abeyance because of terrorism."
"The terrorists would actually see this as a success. We call on the Quartet and on the parties concerned to declare the city of Jerusalem a cultural and religious heritage of mankind."
"We also call for Jerusalem to become a dual capital, at once the capital of the State of Israel and of the future Palestinian State."
"We hope this will come about at the earliest opportunity."
"Further, we call for an international presence in the area. We believe that an international force should be dispatched there when the time is right and subject to the consent of both parties."
"We do of course believe that the State of Israel has the right to defend its citizens and its security. This right must, however, be tempered by the rule of law."
"On the one hand, we invite the Palestinian side to reorganise its security forces and make tangible visible efforts to dismantle terrorist organisations. On the other, we call on the Israeli side to withdraw its army from the autonomous territories."
"Lastly, I should like to refer to an amendment supported by the rapporteur. This is an amendment designed to deal with a hypothetical situation in which the Road Map was blocked."
"Of course, we hope this will not happen, as it would have drastic consequences and lead to still greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians."
"Nonetheless, alternatives need to be in place, notably the establishment of an international mandate in Palestine under the authority of the Quartet. This would include an international force on the ground."
"The acts of war perpetrated by Israel against Syria last Sunday are a violation of international law and fly in the face of political reason. It is my earnest desire that they do not lead to something even worse."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the High Representative for his statement."
"It is with much regret that we have to observe that the large amount of sympathy always enjoyed by Israel in Europe has sustained significant damage over the last year."
"That is something that can be inferred from today’s debate in this House, and it can be observed by keeping an eye on the European media and by listening to the announcements by the European governments, parliaments and political parties, including too the very clear European rejection of the decision by Israel’s Security Cabinet to remove Yasser Arafat from the Palestinian territories."
"In the same way, we must condemn the Israeli attack on Syria, an action that contravenes international law."
"Nor does the fact that the United States is now considering sanctions against Syria contribute to a solution to the Middle East conflict."
"The latest trend is, naturally enough, reflected here in the European Parliament and thus in the report that we have just heard discussed and that has been adopted by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This contains probably the toughest criticism of Israel we have seen here in Parliament."
"The Israeli Government must withdraw its military forces from the occupied territories and bring them home."
"It must put a stop to the executions, and it must suspend all activities surrounding the settlements and the construction of the shameful so-called Security Wall."
"I should like to thank Mr Poettering for his very clear remarks about that wall."
"They must restore public order. They must clearly demonstrate that they are taking practical and visible steps to combat the terrorist movements, they must implement the reforms already proposed and they must organise, where possible, free, fair and open elections."
"We no doubt all share the High Representative’s frustrations, but we must keep to the Quartet’s road map for peace in the Middle East."
"We must reach a definitive peace agreement between two equal, democratic and sovereign states that live peacefully together behind secure and recognised borders on the basis of UN Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967."
"Israel and Palestine cannot resolve the conflict without help from outside, and the international community must continue to put pressure on both parties."
"It may also be necessary to send an international intervention and observation force to the region, a force that the Quartet must assemble, that, under the auspices of the UN, would monitor developments and that, subsequently, could guarantee that the final peace agreement was being observed by the parties."
"– Mr President, the wall being built by the Israeli Government will reduce the already tiny West Bank territories by 58%."
"This is indeed an abomination in economic and human terms, but it is also a real provocation in political terms."
"It brands all the inhabitants of Palestine as terrorists, which is scandalous."
"The wall will not protect Israeli society from the violence and barbarism of suicide bombings against civilians."
"The building of this wall makes the destruction of the Palestinian state possible, security for either of the two peoples unlikely, and also dashes any hope of peace in the Middle East."
"By attempting to use the attack on Syria to exact revenge for the Haifa bombing, in contravention of all international law, Sharon has assumed responsibility for putting the whole region to fire and the sword."
"This killing frenzy will abate only if force is used."
"The European Union has the means to intervene, if it chooses to do so."
"The Council must, therefore, suspend the association agreement while the occupation lasts."
"The European Union can also demand that this illegal wall be destroyed, in accordance with the famous Roadmap."
"The European Union must prevent the threats against President Arafat from being carried out."
"Unfortunately, however, it will not do so without a mass demonstration of solidarity on the part of the people of Europe, appalled by the humiliation, destitution and despair of the Palestinians."
"– Mr President, we are still seeing positions being taken on the conflict in the Middle East which either favour Israel against Palestine or censure the Israelis to the benefit of the Palestinians."
"There are probably arguments in favour of both sides."
"The inalienable right of innocent Israeli communities to defend themselves and the natural desire of Palestinians freely to determine their own future are, of course, among those arguments."
"What is beyond all doubt is that there is no argument to justify the terrorist tactics embraced by both peoples in the region."
"Our group believes that any remaining hope of peace between Israelis and Palestinians still lies in the road map."
"This initiative, which involves not only the belligerents but also the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, must be improved, but cannot be abandoned."
"Its objectives remain valid, aiming as they do to resolve the conflict by 2005, putting an end to the violence and terrorism and allowing a future Palestinian state to exist peacefully alongside Israel. That coexistence requires effective democracy based on tolerance and freedom; we must recognise that such democracy is not yet in place."
"It is absolutely crucial to begin moving forward again following the logic of give-and-take, expecting each party to honour its commitments at every stage."
"We cannot accept matters as they stand at present."
"There have been few, precious few positive steps, and those that have been taken have been answered with violence."
"If the conditions for producing solid ties of mutual trust cannot be created, we will not only witness the deaths of more innocent civilians but also, some day soon, the day when hope itself dies."
"The , therefore, is unacceptable."
"In consequence, the European Union must, in partnership with other interested parties, increase the pressure to make the resumption of the peace process possible and enduring."
"Unlike some of the honourable Members who have spoken here, our group doubts very much indeed that the solution is to send a military force made up of armed units from a coalition of countries to intervene in the area."
"Of course, we do not accept the construction of a wall separating the two countries."
"What seems unacceptable is attempting to replace that wall with a human barricade, even if it is well armed, organised and authorised by the international community."
"Besides, this would be a traditional military response which would not resolve the current situation, typical of urban guerrilla warfare."
"We feel that the full force of European diplomatic pressure should be thrown behind the drive to make it clear to the Palestinian authorities that the despicable suicide attacks against the Israeli civilian population must cease forthwith and for good."
"On the other hand, it is also crucial to ensure that the response of the democratic Israeli Government is restrained, and also to warn neighbouring countries in the region to refrain from harbouring terrorist groups in whose bases criminal activities are sustained and undertaken."
"As we have reiterated on many occasions, there is no such thing as good terrorism, just as there is no such thing as bad terrorism."
"Furthermore, no type of terrorism is ever justified."
"Or justifiable."
"We cannot tolerate any argument for resorting to it, otherwise we recognise its ends as legitimate."
"Wherever terrorism lurks, wherever it rears its head, whatever form it takes, the European Union must not shrink from fighting it."
"That is because we are fully convinced that the resolution of the conflict in the Middle East would deprive international terrorism of a powerful ideological prop."
"Mr President, I too, of course, condemn most vigorously the attack in Haifa, but I am very pleased that Mr Solana expressed the view that Israel too must assume its share of responsibility for the fact that such attacks occur."
"The responsibility that Israel must assume was expressed in the demands made of Israel that we find in Mr Menéndez del Valle’s report, and I am able fully to endorse these."
"I could, however, do with learning, in this House today, what the EU quite specifically intends to do to force Israel to comply with all these requirements and to force it, for example, also to put a stop to its state terrorism that has, of course, led to the deaths of very many more Palestinians than of Israelis."
"That is because, as long as we, here in the EU, do not force Israel to comply with these conditions, Abu Allah does not have an earthly chance of stopping the Palestinian suicide bombers."
"– Mr President, horrifying though they may be, the terrorist attacks in the Middle East – whether Palestinian suicide bombings against Jews or targeted Israeli strikes against Palestinians – cannot hide the fundamentals of the problem."
"For, while it is true that there can be no peace without security, there can be no peace without justice either."
"In the light of this thought, then, what is the fundamental problem?"
"It is knowing whether or not Israel, which has, in the course of the conflicts, come to occupy 72% of the former British Mandate over Palestine, is prepared to hand over the remaining 28% to the Palestinian people, in order for a free and sovereign state to be founded there."
"Is Israel prepared, after thirty-five years of military occupation, to evacuate these territories and cede power back to the Palestinian Authority?"
"If the answer is in the negative – and one is reluctantly forced to admit that nothing hitherto could induce one to think that it might be anything else – then the violence will continue: violence in retaliation, retaliation through violence, colonisation through wall-building."
"We believe that both Israel and Palestine have a right to security within recognised, respected borders, but it is no good weeping over the number of victims if we cannot propose a political solution."
"One might disagree with Mr Cohn-Bendit’s suggestions – I certainly do – but his plan at least has the virtue of existing."
"Let us clearly state where we want to go."
"That is the prerequisite for the resolution of this conflict."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the High Representative has just talked about the dreadful and ongoing death toll in this territory between Israel and the Palestinians."
"We in the European Community must consider what contribution we can make to ensuring that, in the long term, peace is restored to this tormented territory."
"The question is this: What contribution can the European Community make?"
"Indeed, is the European Community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here?"
"The European Community is certainly powerful in the economic field, and its economic contribution to stabilising this territory in the past undoubtedly outstrips the contribution made by others in the same way."
"Yet on the other hand, when it comes to taking final decisions and to providing final guarantees to one side or the other that its people can live in peace and security in this territory in the long term, the European Community in its present state is obviously still too weak to make this vital contribution."
"That is why I too have a question for the High Representative, who is working with great commitment in this region: What role does this territory play in the European Union’s security strategy, which is currently being drafted?"
"I am aware, Mr Solana, that your staff are working very intensively on this security strategy."
"This security strategy also involves the circle of friends with which the European Community is surrounding itself, and so my question is this: how much priority will be given to this particular conflict within that framework, and in developing this circle of friends, will the dreadful conflict which we are discussing here today be given adequate priority?"
"Mr President, let me join in with Members across the House in expressing deep regret for the deaths on all sides in recent attacks in the Middle East."
"It is now more than 1000 days into the Intifada and 3000 people have lost their lives."
"It is time for the killing to stop."
"Terrorism is inexcusable and the Palestinians' legitimate national aspirations cannot be achieved through violence."
"European and worldwide support for their cause is weakened with every suicide bombing."
"Equally, Israel must meet her obligations by freezing settlement activity, restoring Palestinian freedom of movement, ending targeted assassinations and ensuring that the security fence does not encroach on Palestinian land."
"In this European Parliament, more than anywhere else, we understand the prospect for generation after generation of division and fear which this new Berlin wall represents."
"I strongly support Mr Solana's reiteration this morning that the fight against terrorism must take place within international law."
"I call on him to press the undoubted case that Israel's treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is illegal under the fourth Geneva Convention."
"I welcome the agreement reached by EU foreign ministers to freeze the assets of Hamas, but regret their delay in coming to this decision."
"Commissioner, I am proud that the EU's single biggest external aid programme is its contribution to the Palestinian authority."
"Yesterday, however, I spoke to friends and colleagues in the NGO UNA International Service, which is active in the region."
"They tell me that all EU-funded development projects have had to be halted because of the emergency in the Middle East."
"The UK's department for international development is on record as saying that development there is dependent on the relaxation of Israeli curfews, closures and checkpoints, and eventual withdrawal."
"We should roundly condemn the fact that Israeli defence force attacks since 2001 have effectively destroyed EUR 25 million of EU development projects."
"I do not believe those who accuse the EU of unconsciously subsidising the occupation, but Israel should be forced to pay more than one piece of compensation to the European Union for this unjustified destruction."
"Mr President, I have a number of questions for Mr Solana, who was also the Secretary General of ΝΑΤΟ when the intervention was made in the former Yugoslavia."
"Mr High Representative,"
"- Why is Milosevic one thing and Sharon another?"
"- Why is the autocratic government which existed in the former Yugoslavia one thing and the government of Israel, whose members talk officially about the murder of Arafat, another?"
"- Why is the KLA one thing and the jihad another?"
"- Why are Kosovars, who have other rights, one thing and the Palestinians another?"
"- How much longer are we going to have two sets of standards and such hypocrisy?"
"- Why are we searching power stations in Iran with a magnifying glass and no one is telling us what nuclear weapons Israel has?"
"- Why is there an international alliance and ‘desert storm’ when Saddam Hussein attacks Kuwait and just a few paltry announcements when Israel attacks Syria?"
"- Why with the Berlin wall do we say ‘good-bye Lenin’ and with the Palestinian wall do we say ‘good morning Sharon’?"
"- How far will we go?"
"- Where is Europe?"
"- Why is Europe paralysed?"
"- Why does Europe have no voice when the United States does have a voice?"
"- Why does Europe not take a specific initiative at the United Nations for there to be international forces in the area of tension between Israel and Palestine?"
"– Mr President, the neoconservatives warned us that Baghdad was the start of their journey."
"When we were unable to prevent the United States’ war in Iraq, or, worse, when we supported it, as most European governments did, we knew of the heightened security risks we were causing in that region, just as we also knew that the next stop after Baghdad might be Damascus."
"One has only to listen to the language of US and Israeli leaders, the criticisms they have directed at the Syrian regime over the last few months: support for Iraq’s Ba’athist leaders, possession of weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons programmes, harbouring terrorists."
"These are the same fallacious arguments which had already served as a pretext for the US occupation of Iraq. They are now being mobilised again against the leaders of Syria."
"The US Congress draws up a pre-emptive embargo against Syria, and then, hey presto! Israel begins pre-emptive strikes on Syrian territory."
"All the speakers here have condemned the Haifa bombings, and I, of course join them in so doing."
"I would rather not have waited until Mr Barón Crespo’s speech, however, to hear express condemnation of Israel’s violation of Syria’s territorial sovereignty."
"In the same way, I would also like to have heard some reminder of how difficult it is to speak of European foreign policy at a time when certain European countries are involved in the military occupation of Iraq."
"Mr President, after the Israeli raid into Syria, the first of its size since the Yom Kippur war, in retaliation for the dreadful attack in Haifa perpetrated by a young female suicide bomber, the first question is whether we are at risk of entering a dangerous phase for peace throughout the Middle East."
"It is undeniable that between President Assad, who is sticking to a rigid political stance and whose duty it is, therefore, to react strongly to the serious provocation represented by an attack on Syrian soil, and Prime Minister Sharon who, 13 months away from the US elections, can feel that he has a particularly free rein, there are elements that could further inflame tensions and result in the entire region becoming engulfed."
"What we are seeing at the moment, however, is the modest and slow nature of the initial reaction from Damascus, which has undeniably brought the global weakness of Syria’s current position to the fore."
"The little success it has had in submitting its case to the Security Council has shown its isolation at international level, which adds to its relative regional isolation since the war in Iraq and its military weakness since Damascus has stopped receiving supplies of sophisticated weapons sold on credit."
"With military decoupling from Israel increasing greatly, it is difficult to imagine Syria taking the risk of military escalation in the Golan Heights."
"The Republic of Syria will, therefore, no doubt do so on the Blue Line with the intervention of the Shiite Hezbollah."
"This indirect response is not without risk."
"In this sensitive phase European diplomacy could, therefore, play a useful mediating role alongside the two players to help prevent the spiral of another regional escalation from being set in motion."
"Mr President, Secretary-General Solana, the Palestinian Prime Minister, Ahmad Quray categorically excludes Palestinian moves and efforts to combat the terrorist groups that systematically sabotage the fragile and extremely relative peace in the Middle East."
"In this way, the Palestinian Prime Minister has provided absolutely the best grounds for pessimism to all those who do not think there is a future for the Middle East and all those who do not believe there can be peace there."
"Mr Solana, I want you to broach this subject with the Palestinian Prime Minister."
"Among the necessary preconditions for peace in the Middle East are that the Palestinian terrorist groups should be disarmed and that their terrorist activities should not continue."
"If the Palestinian Government neither wishes, nor is effectively able, to do anything about terrorist groups in the Middle East, Israel will do something about them."
"Approximately a week ago, 19 people died in a suicide attack in Haifa."
"In a democratic country such as Israel, which is a sign to the rest of the world that democracy exists in the Middle East, every such suicide attack carried out by a terrorist group will make Israeli opinion less willing to compromise with the Palestinian Authority and less well disposed towards handing land over to the Palestinians."
"No country, including Israel, is obliged in the long term to accept as neighbours either countries that make land available to terrorists who carry out attacks or countries that fail to intervene against such movements in their territories."
"The Palestinian Prime Minister’s, Ahmad Quray’s, impotence in the face of terrorism is perhaps in itself entirely understandable."
"It is difficult to get at armed groups of that size."
"He must nonetheless indicate, politically and in terms of the action he takes, that that is his ambition."
"Nor has the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, dared to intervene vigorously against the terrorist groups, in spite of the fact that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups are indirectly and deliberately sabotaging the peace process with its associated two-state solution, of which the Palestinian Government officially professes itself an adherent."
"Allow me to sum up before I move on to another area."
"The Palestinian Prime Minister must clearly let it be known, in words and action, that there can be no room for terrorist activity in a future two-state solution, least of all in the territory of the Palestinian Authority."
"The second matter I intended to address concerns the way in which religion is misused."
"This has to do with relations between the West and the Islam-dominated world."
"I find it depressing that Muslim religious leaders do not explain much more clearly that suicide attacks cannot be compatible with a religion of love, reconciliation and goodness."
"Religion must stand for love and shared humanity."
"It must stand for reconciliation and for the good, and not for the deaths of innocent people, as in the case of the suicide bombing in Haifa."
"Mr President, every time we debate the problem of the Middle East following a statement by the High Representative, Mr Solana, I get the feeling that he is switching between the ordeals of Tantalus and Sisyphus, or even that his efforts are throwing water into the Danaids' jar on the one hand and on optimism on the other, an optimism that moves either in the realm of Utopia or in the realm of realism."
"What is for sure, in all events, is that a lot of work is needed in order for the sun to revolve."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Middle East crisis is escalating."
"Crises which we thought were over are returning to both Lebanon and Syria, unfortunately on the responsibility of the very person who today is the prime minister of Israel."
"In all events, terrorism of any form is unacceptable and condemnable."
"However, it cannot be used as a pretext for new escalations."
"I should underline here the clear positions taken by Commissioner Monti and the very rare unanimity among the speakers."
"The picture is clear."
"The European Union must take decisive initiatives in order to prevent any danger of expansion and must propose specific solutions and ways of applying them."
"It must intervene decisively and with the force of a third agent."
"The role of umpire between the Israelis and the Palestinians is not enough."
"The role of umpire leads to neutrality and neutrality in crises is not the best option."
"We are not historical journalists."
"We are politicians."
"Now we must decide."
"Now the road map, the Rabin/Arafat agreements must acquire substance through application, even with the presence of UN forces."
"Let me remind you of the popular proverb, ‘you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs’."
"Mr President, our history is one of boundaries that we cross, a history of walls that we pull down after having built them."
"This is because a wall, Mr President, can be rebuilt, but a life cannot, and I agree with Mrs Morgantini when she says that it is not enough to call for international law to be respected."
"Does international law allow a State to protect terrorist cells that are going to attack the civil population of another State?"
"I ask you that."
"I agree with her when she says that it is our duty to intervene and I share her indignation that we cannot be happy with moral stances, as we so often are, stances that ease our consciences, but, ladies and gentlemen, a clear conscience is the opposite of real conscience."
"Yes, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we need a political shock!"
"Nor can I let it be said that this wall is the same as the Berlin wall, as I heard mentioned just now."
"I personally am against this wall, because I am against the line that it follows."
"A wall dividing one nation in two and a wall that aims to create a border, even if the border is completely open to argument, cannot, however, be considered to be the same thing."
"I would like to add that I was one of those that signed a petition against the line the wall follows, in particular at Abu Dis."
"Everyone is calling for a return to the 1967 borders and I am surprised to note that today there are passionate calls for what, yesterday, was rejected just as passionately."
"This is because, in the end, what the more moderate amongst us are asking for today, is nothing more than a return to the Clinton parameters, the parameters that were recently rejected altogether."
"Mr Monti quite rightly said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not recognise Israel’s right to exist, as the suicide attacks have shown."
"We are deeply embroiled in the matter and there is in actual fact not just one conflict; there are four."
"There is a war being waged by the Palestinian authority for the legitimate liberation of the Palestinian state and we are supporting it."
"There is war being waged by the Israeli State for its safety."
"We are supporting this too."
"There is also, and this has to be said, a type of colonial war being waged by some Israelis and there is, and we really cannot overlook this one, a war to destroy the Israeli State being waged by some Palestinian factions."
"If we are not aware of these four conflicts then we cannot understand what is happening."
"Mr President, it is easy to condemn suicide attacks, but what should we do if we were in the same situation?"
"What did those of our parents who lived in occupied countries 60 years ago do?"
"They put up resistance."
"When I saw the Berlin Wall in 1961, it was the first such wall I had ever seen."
"Now, Israel is building a wall of shame."
"Saddam Hussein was toppled because he was suspected of having weapons of mass destruction."
"We know that Israel has weapons of mass destruction."
"The South Africa of apartheid fell because racist oppression was being practised in the country."
"We know that Israel is built entirely upon racist oppression."
"The military junta in Chile fell partly because politicians were being murdered."
"We know that Israel has politicians murdered the whole time."
"East Germany, Saddam Hussein, apartheid and the Chilean junta are gone, but Sharon’s regime of oppression remains."
"What are we doing?"
"What is the EU doing?"
"We are not doing a lot."
"We are not even applying the Association Agreement."
"We are not even breaking off trade relations."
"Why cannot we send our fantastic peace troops to Palestine in order to protect the Palestinian people?"
"Israel will not continue to exist if the present development continues."
"The Middle East is often compared with the Crusader empires that lasted for 200 years."
"A quarter of that period has elapsed."
"It is possible that Israel will continue to exist for 100 years with the help of US money and weapons and the EU’s passivity; but, if no one intervenes, our grandchildren will perhaps witness the destruction of Israel."
"That is not something I wish to see."
"I can assure you that it would be no tea party."
"Let us try to prevent such an occurrence."
"In that short time, I shall do my best to respond to some of the main issues raised during this morning’s sitting. I shall also endeavour to restate once again the position we are endeavouring to defend on behalf of the European Union regarding this dramatic conflict."
"I should like to make some things quite clear from the start."
"Having listened to those Members of the House who took the floor, it seems that essentially we all agree that the present situation is extremely serious."
"The gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated."
"It is becoming increasingly difficult. Consequently, it is incumbent on us to pull together and redouble our efforts on behalf of the European Union."
"The high degree of consensus between the various honourable Members who spoke this morning is worthy of mention."
"It should be noted that almost without exception they all endorsed the Road Map as the best instrument for attaining the desired objective. That objective involves making it possible for a State of Israel and a Palestinian State to coexist in peace and prosperity within a reasonable period of time."
"The Road Map stipulates a short time period. I believe the aforementioned objective is our shared objective."
"I believe it is also fair to say there is a significant degree of consensus across the House that recent events may lead to an escalation of tension in the region. This could be the case in either Syria or Lebanon."
"All this when we are striving to bring the temperature in the region down rather than allowing it to rise."
"Further, I feel all or most honourable Members would agree that the United States might possibly become less engaged, and that this could have a negative effect on the situation."
"Mr Poettering made it quite clear that the forthcoming election campaign in the United States is likely to result in the United States becoming disengaged, if I may resort to an English term."
"Every effort must be made to pre-empt this."
"On the contrary, it is imperative for the United States to remain committed to the process. The European Union will certainly maintain its commitment."
"The Union cannot become a mere observer of a deteriorating process, nor can it simply become a sleeping partner in a process sliding down an increasingly slippery and difficult slope."
"Mr Poettering also referred to Iraq."
"I should like to follow up on this. I have visited all the countries in the region, and it has become clear to me that the issue of Iraq has a bearing on the Palestinian problem."
"I would venture to suggest that if discussions were held with any Arab political leader at the present juncture, that leader would speak of a process deemed by the Arab world to be a Western campaign against Arabs."
"Great care is needed to ensure that Arab political leaders do not perceive this process as a move against the Islamic world. They must not see it as an attack by the Western world on the Arab world."
"It is therefore important to reiterate time and again that this is not a fight against particular civilisations or religions. Rather, we are engaged in a struggle to defend the values of peace and stability in both areas."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit rightly said that we are involved in what could be termed an incremental process."
"This so-called incremental process began with the Oslo process, and the Road Map is a further stage of it."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested the solution might lie in electric shock treatment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am inclined to doubt that there is currently sufficient political energy in both parties and in the international community for strong electric shock treatment to be an option."
"Only today we have witnessed another difficult and complicated debate in the United Nations Security Council."
"The purpose of the debate was to adopt a common stance regarding the situation in Syria."
"No agreement was reached."
"I am therefore of the opinion that there is currently insufficient energy to permit the application of electric shock treatment."
"It is perhaps incumbent on us Europeans to generate the energy required."
"As I see it, a verification process is the first thing to set up."
"The Road Map will not implement itself."
"It will be well-nigh impossible to see the Road Map through without a verification process in place."
"It is therefore important to ensure that any verification mechanisms are such that they can be implemented immediately. This was also discussed at the New York meeting."
"I should now like to refer to the situation that is likely to arise this morning. A new Palestinian Government will probably be in place, led by Mr Abu Ala."
"This government is entitled to our support if it complies with our requests. We need to insist it wages a determined war on terrorism, and that it pursues its reforms."
"These are essential features of a State. We are doing all we can to ensure that a Palestinian State is established as soon as reasonably possible."
"One key feature of a State is that it should have a single financial system."
"The necessary effort in this direction has been made."
"The Finance Minister has brought this about. Another key feature is that the State should have control over arms."
"Prime Minister Abu Ala must therefore be urged to ensure his government takes all possible steps to control the security forces and allow only legitimate weapons."
"It is also important to urge the Israeli Government to improve living conditions for Palestinian citizens, and to call a halt to the building of the wall."
"I was moved by Mr Poettering’s emotional account of what a wall can mean to individuals who have experience of being kept apart by one. Israel must also be urged to tackle the matter of the settlements seriously."
"The latter is not something new in the Road Map. It featured in the Mitchell report several years ago."
"I think I have outlined what I feel we can and should do here and now as Europeans to try and overcome the present crisis. In December we should be in a position to conduct a final review."
"It will then be possible to consider how best to go forward into the coming year, in full awareness of the parameters of the solution. I am confident that the latter are known to all."
"They are not very far removed from those mentioned by some honourable Members who took the floor in the House today."
"I should therefore like to thank the House for its cooperation. We all need to keep our eyes wide open and our determination well alive."
"Only then will it be possible to control the situation that is unfortunately unfolding in a land so close to our hearts."
"I was asked how the Middle East is to be dealt with within the security strategy."
"These people are our neighbours."
"Their land adjoins ours."
"The issue must therefore continue to one of our main concerns."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you."
"It will be my pleasure to communicate any further information to Parliament personally, as soon as we are in a position to do so."
". Mr President, I have some very brief remarks on some of the points raised in this debate."
"On the issue of a peace-keeping force – mentioned so eloquently by Mr Poettering and also, in a different context, by Mr Cohn-Bendit and others – we support anything that bears the prospect of hope."
"However, it is clear that both parties need to agree."
"Unfortunately, we do not see this happening for a number of reasons: the Israelis mistrust of international involvement, the impossibility of separating parties as a result of settlements and the lack of a guarantee that the international force will not be drawn into conflict."
"On the Syria Association Agreement referred to by Mr Belder, the agreement will help draw Syria into a more constructive engagement and will give us an opportunity to discuss the issues of mutual concern."
"It is clear that all countries must actively comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1373."
"The Association Agreement will include a clause on cooperation against terrorism."
"On the issue mentioned by Mrs Vachetta and others of the sanctions against Israel, I am afraid to say that economic sanctions have a rather bad track record of success."
"They simply do not work."
"What works is engagement and dialogue."
"The Association Agreement with Israel provides for exactly that."
"That political dialogue allows us to raise all issues of concern."
"We believe that suspending the agreement would deprive us of this opportunity."
"Mr Von Wogau referred to the ring of friends."
"Our policy is one of openness and inclusiveness This is not a political condition, but it is clear that the ongoing conflict will not allow our partners to reap the benefits of our new initiative."
"Finally, Mr Howitt mentioned the situation of the EU programmes on the ground."
"Given the circumstances on the ground it has indeed become very difficult and rather costly to deliver our assistance, particularly as regards infrastructure projects and humanitarian aid."
"We are more successful in keeping our software projects going, particularly as far as institution-building and reform are concerned."
"I should like to express the Commission's appreciation for this highly interesting debate."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti."
"Mr President, according to the agenda, we were due to have a debate on the situation in the Middle East and yet, apart from Mrs Kuntz’s speech, only Palestine has been discussed."
"As far as I am concerned, Palestine is not the Middle East."
"In French it is what we call the Near East."
"It seems that there is a Middle Eastern country that has completely disappeared from our radar screens;"
"Iraq. I am not seeking to force a debate on Iraq, but personally I had prepared a speech on that country."
"I would simply like to ask a question which I feel is relevant to this House, which is so mindful of human rights: what exactly do we know today, in terms of international law, about the fate of the former head of the Iraqi diplomatic corps, Mr Tariq Aziz?"
"This is an extremely relevant question, perhaps to be debated at our next meeting."
"Thishas been noted,Mr Gollnisch."
"You will be aware that honourable Members take the floor to say what they feel to be appropriate. It does seem that Members wished to discuss the problem of Israel and Palestine at this stage today."
"The debate is closed."
"It has persisted in the military occupation, in destroying infrastructure, housing and other installations, in carrying out targeted killings, and in holding more than 7 000 Palestinian prisoners, almost 340 of whom are children, in Israeli jails. It has continued to violate the most fundamental rights of the Palestinian people on a regular basis, attacking Syria and conducting a campaign of genuine state terrorism."
"It is with frustration and indignation, therefore, that one hears speeches by Members of this House demanding respect for the Rule of Law."
"How can one demand that President Arafat and the Palestinian Government take steps to combat acts of terrorism while the Israeli military is occupying Palestine?"
"The European Union must table initiatives and practical measures."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EU and Israel must be suspended, as requested in the EP resolution on the ‘Situation in the Middle East’, of 10 April 2002."
"The Commission and the Council must table an initiative within the UN, demanding that the UN negotiations be concluded, recognising the Palestinians’ right to dignity and to their own independent state, and sending international observers and a UN-backed peacekeeping force to intervene."
"Again today the hypocritical ‘defenders’ of human rights and the oppressed are silent."
"Apart from hollow proclamations, not a word of support for the Palestinian people fighting for human dignity for the whole of mankind in the face of imperialist brutality."
"They reject proposals to end the funding and arming of the butcher Sharon."
"They prohibit any pressure on Israel to end the occupation and its attacks, which are the sole cause of the hardships of the two peoples."
"Solana, as his master's voice, condemns the Palestinian resistance, while calling on Israel to show restraint and generosity."
"He also cites the famous road map which was signed by the Palestinian Authority with a gun to its head and which is being trampled underfoot by Israel, to exert more pressure and coercion on the Palestinians to make new concessions, basically to start a Palestinian civil war."
"Not a word about the satanically inspired wall designed to choke Palestine or about the criminal settlements and the cynical threats against the elected President Arafat."
"We denounce this policy, we express our undivided support for the Palestinian resistance and President Arafat."
"We stand by the Israeli communists and all those in this country who, like the 27 pilots and hundreds of Israeli soldiers and officers, are fighting to stop Sharon's cannibalistic machine."
"We call here too for a front of solidarity for peace in the Middle East and for reconciliation between the two peoples in two independent, sovereign states."

". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are dealing with is not politically controversial; on the contrary, it has to do with the safety of air travel, which is a matter of concern for us and for all travellers."
"Although we are not experts, we know about air travel and have experience of it."
"From that experience we know that not all airlines and not all aircraft are equally safe."
"Some companies, who are not too fussy about safety, can still, these days, change over to other airports where less stringent monitoring is in force."
"That shows the need for a Community safety policy for airports."
"In any case, the Commission estimates that, even if the likelihood of an accident is unchanged from in 1996, it should necessarily follow from the observable growth in air traffic that, by 2015, there will be a serious accident happening every week."
"The likelihood of an accident varies widely among different regions and continents."
"Did you know that the airlines with which you fly in Africa, Asia, South and Central America, are far more likely to meet with accidents – at least twice the world average?"
"The risk is lowest in Western Europe and Australia, but highest in Eastern European countries – 50 times the risk in Western Europe."
"This directive is therefore absolutely necessary if internationally applied safety controls are to be harmonised."
"The continued absence of a Community policy is to be regretted; this is still a task for the Member States."
"It is regrettable too that the Member States and the airlines are afraid of supplying the public with the information that we consider necessary."
"Mr President, pursuant to Rule 144(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that this report be referred back to committee. This is for the reasons I adduced yesterday as rapporteur, namely the need to adjust the report to the interinstitutional agreement."
"Pursuant to Rule 144, I will therefore give the floor to one speaker in favour and to one speaker against."
"– Mr President, I am in favour of this referral, but I should like to point out that this has become a precedent, because we debated in this House a report that had not been brought up to date and was then referred back to committee for the vote."
"I think this is a very odd procedure to say the least, and one that I hope will not be repeated."
"Mr President, it is a very simple matter."
"Both paragraph 11 and our amendment in its original form mention the possible budgetary consequences of 'the' increase in the number of agreements in the near future."
"The problem we have is, first of all, that we cannot know there will be an increase and even if we could predict that, we cannot know what the increase will be."
"Therefore it is only logical to change the word to 'any' so that it would read: 'Calls on the Commission to draw up a sound financial chapter concerning the financing of the fisheries agreements which should take into consideration the possible budgetary consequences of any increase in the number of agreements in the near future'."
"I hope that is clear to the House."
"I would like to thank the Members who took part in the vote."
"I would ask you to remain in the House because, in a few minutes, we will welcome the President of the Republic of Latvia, a country that will soon be a member of the European Union, for a formal sitting."
"Explanations of vote will take place after the formal sitting."
". To make speed-limiters mandatory in a wide range of vehicles, effectively imposing a speed limit of 62 mph or less throughout the EU, is far too prescriptive."
"The main aims of the proposal – to improve road safety and reduce environmental pollution – are worthy ones, but there is not sufficient evidence that this is the best way to achieve them."
"Conservative MEPs also fear it is inevitable that, in due course, there will be calls for speed limiters to be introduced for private cars, which really would be far beyond what would be acceptable for most people."
"Speed limitation on-board systems for vehicles transporting passengers and goods have proved very useful in raising road safety standards, reducing the seriousness of injuries sustained as a result of accidents and reducing levels of air pollution and fuel consumption."
"It aims to broaden the scope of the harmonised requirements relating to speed limitation devices or similar speed limitation on-board systems for all motor vehicles of categories M2 and M3 designed for transporting passengers. This will help make the road system safer and more sustainable, which is crucial to the execution of future transport policy."
"– Mr President, our vote in favour of the solidarity fund to cover the requirements of countries and regions struck by natural disasters comes with two hopes or two recommendations."
"First, we hope that with the forthcoming 2004 financial year the fund may be suitably expanded, or at least index-linked, as Mr Turchi assured me he would propose; since the fund is so meagre, it is completely inadequate to meet the needs of the recipient Member States, as has already been seen this year."
"With regard to our second hope, setting up the fund is a first, concrete step forward, but it is not enough in itself."
"It is not enough to think about funding countries struck by natural disasters if we do not also think about a serious forecasting and prevention policy."
"We believe the time has come for the Union to think of setting up a European Civil Protection Agency with the remit of coordinating and managing risk prevention and emergencies among Member States."
"Recent painful examples in Europe remind us that catastrophes and disasters can be supranational, and yet one cannot rely on the generosity of volunteers or the competence and resources of just the country immediately affected."
"Europe should be able to have adequate human, financial and technical resources available, ready to take prompt action."
"This may be an ambitious objective, but it is not unachievable."
"After all, every citizen, and not just every European citizen, has a right to safety that I believe is physiological rather than constitutional."
"We therefore bring the problem to the attention of the Commission and Parliament in the hope that we shall not remain its only proponents."
"I could only vote in favour of this report, which confirms the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in Portugal’s favour by granting it EUR 48.539 million – in other words, the exact amount requested by the Portuguese Government – to deal with the effects of this summer’s devastating fires."
"This amount will allow emergency measures to be set in place for the communities stricken by the consequences of the fires, which killed 18 people and destroyed more than 403 000 hectares of woodland."
"It will help alleviate the social costs incurred by the loss of jobs and sources of income, and the environmental impact of the fires. It will help restore productive potential in the affected areas."
"The Commission, therefore, should review the regulations governing the mechanisms by which funds are allocated by the Solidarity Fund, which was created precisely in order to respond effectively to emergencies. The Commission should make these Community administrative procedures more flexible and simpler."
"I should like to conclude by reminding you that forest fire monitoring and prevention measures need to be devised, and appropriations for the Forest Focus programme increased."
"The Portuguese delegation of the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the European Parliament’s decision to grant Portugal EUR 48.5 million from the Solidarity Fund, to help with the recovery of the huge tracts of woodland and agricultural land destroyed in our country by this year’s fires. We would like to emphasise, nonetheless, that this amount falls far short of what is needed, given the scale of the tragedy."
"In this connection, we would remind you that during the various budgetary debates after 1999 the Portuguese socialist delegation proposed repeatedly that a fund of this nature be established, and we vigorously support Commissioner Barnier’s intention to review current regulations to allow them to respond more adequately to natural disasters on this scale."
"Bearing in mind the modest sum available from the Solidarity Fund, we appeal to the Commission to make all possible use of the flexibility clause, as this is a case, so as to allow money to be reprogrammed from the Structural Funds and from rural development, in order to support Portuguese rural society through an integrated programme to recover from the effects of this disaster."
". I support and have voted in favour of Mr Colom i Naval’s report, which authorises financial payment from the Solidarity Fund to Portugal."
"The scale and severity of the tragedy which struck our country justify appeals for EU support."
"The Commission’s first response was confined to EUR 30 million, which Commissioner Barnier himself recognised as falling well short of expectations and requirements."
"I welcome the European Parliament’s display of solidarity, its support for Portugal and the negotiating skills of the Portuguese Government, in particular those of the Secretary of State for European Affairs, Dr Carlos Costa Neves."
"The EUR 48.5 million in aid for which we have voted today is a fairer and more fitting amount than that previously provided."
"The repercussions of the forest fires which swept through Portugal this summer are far from over."
"The heavy rains have brought landslides and floods which have threatened to worsen the scale of the catastrophe, over and above the environmental consequences in terms of soil erosion, and the severe socio-economic problems experienced in areas of the interior of the country where woodland was the main source of economic activity."
"The figures do not convey the depths of the suffering of our communities, although they do illustrate the scale of the disaster, which caused the deaths of 20 people, laid waste 5% of Portugal’s total land area and almost 11% of our woodland areas, leaving 45 000 people deprived of any source of income, and costing a total of more than EUR 1.3 billion, almost 1.12% of Portugal’s gross national income, in direct damages."
"We therefore welcome the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund to provide EUR 48.5 million for Portugal, after the Commission’s latest adjustment in the light of new information received, in accordance with our direct request in the Committee on Budgets."
"We would remind you, however, that more should have been done, as we proposed."
"The amount of aid is at odds with the scale of the tragedy, and this raises the issue of assessing and revising the current criteria for mobilising the Solidarity Fund."
". The Commission’s proposal to award such widely varying amounts of aid from the Solidarity Fund is the result of the very different assessments of the damage caused undertaken by the governments concerned and submitted to the Commission."
"Those regions affected by the disaster are set to receive less than a fifth of the amounts Portugal and Italy are to be awarded following the fires and the earthquake."
"This is due to the Government of Spain adopting a mistaken strategy. It understated the extent of the disaster."
"Consequently the regions affected will receive far less from the Community than they are entitled to."
"The EUR 8.6 million in question is the only additional sum Spain is to receive further to the disaster."
"The only Community aid received to date resulted from reprogramming funds previously allocated to Spain."
"In the light of research such as that undertaken by the Barrie de la Maza Foundation, this is a derisory amount. This research sets the damage at between EUR 4 000 million and EUR 6 000 million."
"According to the Government of Spain it is only EUR 436 million."
"The accident was comparable to the disaster. Then, the United States estimated the damage at USD 10 000 million."
". As you know, Portugal was scourged from north to south this summer by a plague of fire on a scale never before seen."
"In all, more than 400 000 hectares were consumed by fire."
"Apart from the economic losses, valued at EUR 1 372 billion, we also regret the loss of the 18 victims who died and the sources of income and homes of 45 000 people."
"Apart from the human and economic consequences, this tragedy has also brought social and environmental costs."
"We have now voted in favour of this proof of the European Union’s solidarity, to be given to the affected communities through the Solidarity Fund."
"I would like to join the Secretary of State, Mr Costa Neves, in sincerely thanking the European Commission and the European Parliament for their speedy and efficient processing of Portugal’s application for Solidarity Fund assistance."
"The amount contributed by the Solidarity Fund will be EUR 48.5 million."
"I can only point out that this amount equals 8.5% of the total damage suffered."
"Finally, if I may, I will agree with the rapporteur’s observation that the damage caused by this disaster could, in part, have been avoided by means of adequate and effectively-implemented prevention measures."
"For this reason, I support the increase in the budget for those elements of the Forest Focus programme dealing with prevention policy."
"The Solidarity Fund is of a different nature from the other funds, and should provide compensation for part of the public costs incurred as a result of the disaster."
"Financial assistance given in order to alleviate large-scale natural disaster scenarios, such as the fires that ravaged the communities of southern Europe, should go towards the speedy re-establishment of normal living conditions in the affected areas."
"Decentralising the financial management of such assistance is of the utmost importance, since, as we know, elected local authorities are closest to the disaster and feel it most."
"In the specific case of the fires in my region, the mountains of the western Algarve, it would make perfect sense if the relevant local authorities were asked to take part, together with civil society organisations, in the programming and management of these funds."
"My suggestions include, amongst other things, measures aimed at reorganising land use, reforestation using indigenous plants and mobilising small investors, with the help of tax and/or other incentives favouring the installation and maintenance of preventive equipment in woodland areas."
". The aim of this report is, amongst other things, to enter into the budget the EUR 48.5 million mobilised to assist Portugal in accordance with the provisions of the Solidarity Fund in the wake of the tragic forest fires which swept through Portugal this summer."
"The Solidarity Fund was mobilised quickly, and this amending budget was adopted in one single reading. That is very welcome, since it ensures more rapid assistance from the EU budget following the applications presented."
"The amount now approved, however, is clearly insufficient given the costs of the direct damages, more than EUR 1.3 billion, and, in particular, given the total costs of the eligible damages, around EUR 104.3 million."
"It should be remembered that when Commissioner Schreyer was questioned in the Committee on Budgets, she expressed her willingness to review the sums allocated to Portugal if the damage estimates were to rise. This would be done principally through an amending budget."
"The Commissioner has kept her word by issuing this amending budget once the Portuguese Government provided further information."
"It is now the government’s turn to assess the current situation as regards the consequences of the forest fires, taking particular account of the effects of the rains in the fire-affected areas."
".– As a Portuguese, it is with great sadness that I recall the terrible, nation-wide disaster that caused the deaths of a score of people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests and farmland, while 45 000 people lost their possessions and their jobs."
"The direct damage suffered by Portugal amounts to almost EUR 946.489 million, a sum well over 0.6% of GNI (in other words, more than EUR 718.12 million)."
"On 4 August 2003, following the tragic summer fires in Portugal, the Portuguese authorities announced their intention to submit to the Commission a request for mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"The request was officially received on 13 August and additional information was submitted by Portugal on the 22 of that month; at a public hearing in September, Portugal stated that it was asking for Solidarity Fund intervention to the value of EUR 48.5 million."
"In view of the fact that, in its September resolution on the ‘effects of the summer heat wave’, the European Parliament suggested that the Solidarity Fund contribution should be increased in the case of Portugal so as to be closer to the eligible amounts, estimated at EUR 94 million …"
"In spite of the good intentions displayed, the ‘Better Law-Making’ report and interinstitutional agreement are unconvincing."
"Indeed, the fine declarations concerning respect for subsidiarity are in contrast to the Convention’s proposals, supported by the European Parliament, which entrust ultimate control to the Court of Justice."
"In a democracy, it is unacceptable for the Court of Justice to decide whether opposition by the national parliaments to a proposal by the Commission is valid."
"In addition, the mechanism of the interinstitutional agreement, respect for which depends upon the good will of the institutions, is in itself an infringement of the legal quality and certainty ostensibly sought by this exercise."
"The CPNT MEPs of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are unable to approve these documents."
"I voted in favour of the Frassoni report on ‘Better Law-Making’."
"While awaiting the entry into force of the European Constitution, which will bring unquestionable advances when it comes to the transparency of Community procedures and respect for the distribution of competences and for the principle of subsidiarity, I believe it is necessary to improve legislative practice in the framework of the treaties currently in force."
"From this point of view, the interinstitutional agreement between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament is good news, for it offers greater clarity and coherence while respecting the powers, procedures and general principles of our positive law."
"Too often, the documents adopted by our Assembly are still difficult to access by the uninitiated. We can do better."
"The interinstitutional agreement opens the way to realising an ambition of the kind already referred to in the White Paper on Governance."
"It now remains to give practical expression to that ambition."
".– I believe it is essential to improve the coordination of the law-making process."
"I therefore agree to a great extent with the interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission to improve the quality of law-making through a set of new initiatives and procedures."
"Of these, I would like to highlight the establishment of indicative timetables for the various stages leading to the final adoption of each legislative proposal, and the attempt to ensure better synchronisation for the treatment of dossiers by the preparatory bodies of each arm of the legislative authority."
"I welcome the reference to ‘self-regulation’, which does not come within the Union’s mandate and allows private partners to adopt common guidelines among themselves and for themselves at European level."
"The draft agreement also addresses the issue of better transposition of Community law into national law, whereby the institutions undertake to ensure that all directives include a legally-binding time limit for their transposition that is as short as possible."
"In my opinion, the result of this agreement is quite well-balanced and achieves the objective of improving the quality of Community law-making."
"I therefore voted in favour of it."
"By envisaging the space industry only in terms of struggle in a competitive market, basically with the United States, this report has an entire symbolic dimension to it."
"It obviously wants increased access to public funds, that is to say to taxpayers’ money, in order to help European businesses retain, or acquire shares in, this market."
"In the interests, moreover, of still greater efficiency, it recommends orders in the military sector, something that, in addition, would enable manufacturers to benefit from the knowledge already acquired in this area and would move in the direction of establishing a European military force independent of that of the United States – a military force which some people consider vital to conducting operations that they refer to as ‘peacekeeping’, but which are nothing other than operations for defending the interests of European manufacturers and financiers."
"By its clarity, such a report is like a confession: the aims of the European institutions are none other than to mobilise knowledge and public funds in the interests of European private capital, in the space sector as elsewhere."
"We can obviously only vote against a report so obviously marked by these preoccupations alone."
"I have supported, and voted in favour of, this report which acknowledges the efforts made by a number of European states to ensure that Europe now has policies concerned with space."
"The results obtained are impressive."
"For all that, if, now, there is a desire to avoid serious difficulties and a situation in which, in the end, only the law of the strongest continues to apply, rapid progress needs to be made towards a controlled communitisation, as is being done in the field of research."
"It is not a question of ‘doing in place of’, but of enabling European added value to be brought to bear."
"Space will be ever more present in all aspects of people’s daily lives."
"Europe needs to be in space."
"Space will always be an engine of industrial innovation."
"Europe’s industrial future also depends, therefore, upon our investment in space."
"Those are just a few of the reasons why I have supported this report and voted in favour of it."
"I have voted with satisfaction and relief in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Bodrato, concerning the Green Paper on European space policy."
"Satisfaction, because what is at stake is European autonomy: a Europe that is sovereign in strategic terms must have its own military and spatial capacities."
"Relief, because this vote shows that the European institutions have become aware of the concerns of manufacturers and politicians faced with the recent economic deterioration of this sector and the increased strength of our international competitors."
"Europe will take up the challenge of space if it takes strong measures in response to the White Paper to be presented in December and if manufacturers engage in restructuring in order to become more competitive."
"If this is to happen, we shall need a boost in public investments."
"Otherwise, our big groups will not retain their high profiles in terms of technology and human resources, and we shall lose skills."
"Following the crucial support given to the Galileo programme and to Ariane V, this vote by the European Parliament shows that the European Union knows how to defend its vital strategic interests and, over and above that, wishes to contribute to the knowledge of a universe about which the human race cannot remain indifferent."
".– We uphold the view that a space policy based on cooperation between Member States should be clearly and unambiguously founded on the non-proliferation of weapons, the non-use of space for military purposes and a rejection of the arms race in space."
"We have therefore always denounced and criticised the United States for proposing to set up a National Missile Defence system (NMD), which will militarise the use of space and set off an arms race, with dire consequences for the future of all humankind."
"This report not only fails to criticise the militarisation of space, but even attributes a central role to a ‘European agency for Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities’, proposing a partnership between it and the European Space Agency and stressing the ‘dual nature of […] civil and military activities’ in space."
"The resolution also supports the military use of satellite systems in carrying out what it euphemistically terms ‘peacekeeping operations’, which means paving the way for war operations, thus going against the spirit of United Nations General Assembly Resolution No 49/74 of 15 December 1994 on prevention of an arms race in outer space, and in particular Article 4 thereof."
"We therefore voted against the resolution."
"As a consequence of the decline in the telecommunications sector and the tough competition surrounding launchers, the European space industry is now in such a serious economic position that its survival is threatened."
"This, together with the fact that the EU is facing its biggest enlargement ever, involving ten new Member States, and the fact that its resources are limited, shows that the EU should focus its activities better and devote itself to fewer specialist areas."
"For that reason, I have voted against the report."
"Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) 4064/89on the control of concentrations between undertakings sets out the guidelines according to which the Commission is to assess whether a concentration between undertakings is or is not compatible with the common market."
"Instead of the current model, which mainly concentrates upon whether the companies would acquire a dominant position, we recommend a more flexible model (what is known as the SLC test), according to which a concentration between undertakings must be prohibited if it may contribute to a weakening of competition or the creation of a monopoly."
"It is exhilarating to see the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the nation states struggling in their attempts to regulate their sacrosanct competitive market."
"The concentrations that everyone aspires to control are only, in fact, the logical outcome of this competition in which the biggest fish naturally devour the smallest."
"Whether it is the Commission or the nation states that pretend to control these battles between financial sharks is of no importance from the workers’ point of view."
"In any case, capitalist groups already dominate the economy and know how to influence and, at worst, disregard or circumvent the pathetic decisions taken by the European institutions."
"What the report calls the ‘control of concentrations between undertakings’ has no purpose other than that of defending the interests of certain capitalists against those of others."
"At no time is it a question of controlling concentrations in such a way that they are useful to society and do not harm employees and consumers."
"At no time is reference made to the dramatic consequences for the populations of these factory closures, restructurings and social plans accompanying the concentrations."
"It is to express our absolute rejection of the report’s concerns that we have voted against it."
".– The trend towards increasing concentration and centralisation of capital is inherent to the capitalist system and is driven by the primacy of competition and the growing liberalisation and internationalisation of capital."
"The emphasis on this strengthened intercapitalist competition, connected with the constant revolution in production processes generated by technological development and economies of scale, leads to the law of the survival of the fittest, throwing competitors out of the marketplace and creating markets that are more and more oligopolistic or even monopolistic."
"Competition policy, particularly the control of concentrations, is an attempt by the system to self-regulate and to avoid the vicissitudes of economic cycles and the negative influences of dominant or concerted positions on the markets."
"Evidently, however, it cannot reverse the general trend."
"In view of current liberalisation processes and the extent of market integration, however, there has been strong pressure to amend Regulation No 4064/89, which was seen to be too restrictive of the need to create strong business groups that could compete internationally."
"The Commission’s proposal thus takes a step forward with new concepts of concentration on a Community scale. The rapporteur wants to go even further."
"He wants a narrower concept of concentration, in the sense of restricting control or opposition to a concentration to a minimum."
"We also reject this report on these grounds."
"The Della Vedova report reflects the ideology of the Commission, adopted in its own way by the liberal majority of this Parliament."
"Indeed, the real problems posed by the acceleration of the global movement towards concentrations between undertakings are treated exclusively as threats to competition."
"The known risks for consumers (price rises, lack of transparency etc) or for the employees of these companies (such as stock market redundancies, the abandonment of activities and the transfer of production to companies offering least in terms of social benefits) are not taken into account as such."
"As if free competition had demonstrated that it was up to dealing with these risks!"
"In France, the latest concentrations between undertakings – from Vivendi to Air France, from Alstom to Péchiney – have shown how, in terms of their concerns, national and European institutions are getting it all wrong when it comes to the things that are needed."
"For us, it is, however, these very things that go to the heart of the general interest."
"Taking them into account would certainly make it worthwhile revising the procedure for the European control of concentrations between undertakings, but the option followed in this case is still hostage to the ‘healthy competition’ dogma."
"That is why we have voted against this resolution which, with its blind alleys, is an insult to the employees concerned and, more generally, to all citizens."
"In carrying out its work on revising competition law, the Commission is proposing here a thoroughgoing change to the regulation on concentrations."
"This initiative must be fully welcomed."
"For several years now, European companies, now joined by the Community judge, have been emphasising the shortcomings of Regulation 4064/89."
"The unduly long procedure for investigating concentrations and the imprecise nature of the notion of dominant position were only two features that were clearly not such as to permit the carrying out of operations rendered more and more necessary in the interests of the global competitiveness of European companies."
"The Commission’s proposal, enriched by the amendments adopted by Parliament, should normally enable the big European industrial groups to hold their own and compete on equal terms with their American competitors."
"In applying the new wording, the Commission will still have to demonstrate genuine European ambition and set aside the approach, couched in narrow accounting terms, that has again recently prompted it to refuse certain industrial mergers."
"A legal text is nothing independently of the interpretation given of it."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will embark upon its own cultural revolution and, in particular, abandon this procedural zeal that has done so much to harm companies and European employees."
".– Like the rapporteur, I welcome the European Commission’s intention to carry out a wide-ranging review of the Community anti-trust or competition system, within which this proposal for a regulation is another important step."
"Several recent decisions by the European Court of Justice have pointed to the need to clarify and simplify competition rules, especially in view of the competitive environment in other parts of the world."
"In general, both the courts and the business community are stressing the need to take account of the requirements of a free and dynamic market, which should not be excessively burdened by long and cumbersome procedures for transactions which are in no way illicit, but are part of the normal functioning of a free market."
"Regulation of the various aspects of Community competition law – particularly rules on state aids, concentration operations, abuse of a dominant position or concerted action aimed at distorting the market – should never lose sight either of the requirements of an open, free economy that wants to be regulated or of the right level of Community intervention in companies and the Member States, which, as we know, is governed by the principle of proportionality in this area."
"Since the rapporteur succeeded in introducing both these concerns, I voted in favour of the report."
"The Commission has consulted the European Parliament on the proposal for a Council regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings."
"The Commission wishes to assure itself that there will be no distortion of competition in the common market."
"Steps should therefore be taken to prevent dominant positions and oligopolies because these are in danger of leading to a rise in prices, the regulation of production and a reduction in quality."
"In these respects, the Commission’s proposal was clear and vigorous."
"Many of the rapporteurs’ amendments were aimed, however, at softening the Commission’s proposals, with the justification that concentrations between undertakings are entirely lawful in themselves and cannot be compared with cartels."
"The rapporteur believed, therefore, that the Commission should not be given the same powers of investigation in the matter of concentrations between undertakings as in the matter of cartels."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that the Commission’s more stringent wordings are better than the main thrust of Parliament’s adopted amendments."
"That is why I have voted ‘no’ in the final vote."
"The resolution may criticise the situation concerning the transmission of data to the USA, but it accepts its legalisation."
"We have a series of international police state measures to which we are adding a new one."
"The Council of Ministers for Justice has decided to allow police surveillance on the territory of other Member States of suspects from the territory of the police conducting the surveillance."
"This is allowed for a wide range of crimes, whereas before it was only possible for offences which resulted in the extradition of the suspect."
"These crimes, apart from terrorism, murder, kidnap, taking hostages, trafficking in human beings, transporting explosives and transporting toxic waste, also include theft, offences of a serious sexual nature and smuggling drugs and psychotropic substances."
"The French and German police will only need to request authorisation from the Greek authorities or notify them of the surveillance."
"Thus, soon the cafés in Omonia Square and Syntagma Square, especially in the run-up to the Olympics, will look like a scene from an Ian Fleming or John Le Carré novel."
"The French policeman will be watching a pickpocket, the German policeman will be watching a junkie and the Greek police will just be looking on."
"We saw this with the murky Van affair, where foreigners conducted surveillance and which was linked to the 17 November affair, and now we shall see them ‘legally’ imposing complete chaos and a Euro-police state and subverting national sovereignty."
"I abstained from voting on the resolution on transfer of personal data by airlines to the American authorities in the case of transatlantic flights, devised with a view to tracking down terrorists or perpetrators of serious crimes."
"In the interests of protecting private life, the European Parliament is, indeed, requesting that these transfers be deferred until an appropriate international agreement has been concluded."
"The intention is laudable, but the reasons behind it exaggerated and the result out of proportion."
"The reasons are exaggerated because the resolution overestimates the risks (this data is not all that personal since the interested parties have already passed it on to the airlines) and tends to restrict the categories of criminal sought (why accept this data in connection with tracking down terrorists, but not murderers or rapists?)"
"The result of European reluctance would be to prohibit airlines from passing on all the data concerned, something that would put them in an untenable position, and to complicate the crucial fight against terrorism."
"I therefore think that our proposals should have been the other way around: accept transfers of data for a transitional period, at the expiry of which a fair and transparent international agreement should be concluded."
".– In reacting to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the European Union showed its solidarity with the United States’ goal of preventing and fighting terrorism."
"No matter how noble the goals may be, however, the ends cannot justify the means."
"The USA has been adopting a large number of measures to strengthen border controls, such as the requirement for airlines to transfer Passenger Name Record (PNR) data."
"In March this year, the European Parliament considered it unacceptable for such data to be transmitted if there were no assurance of an adequate level of protection and compliance with existing Community rules."
"The Commission’s conclusions indicate that it is not possible to consider the data protection provided to be adequate (the objective that would justify obtaining and storing data remains unclear; the amount of data seems excessive and disproportionate; the period for which data are kept is excessive; no obligations have been accepted by the USA; and there is no means for appeal either by passengers or by the EU itself)."
"It is therefore essential that any transmission of data in contravention of Community rules should be stopped."
"We have to determine which data may be transmitted and ensure that there is no discriminatory treatment and no retention of data beyond a passenger’s stay. Passengers must be fully informed in advance and must always have access to a swift and efficient appeals system."
".– The current situation, whereby the United States authorities have access to transatlantic passengers’ personal data (PNR, or ‘Passenger Name Record’) from computer booking systems (APIS, or ‘Advance Passenger Information System’), is unacceptable. This situation infringes the right to personal data protection, including the current Community directive, as in fact this resolution states:"
"- the objective remains unclear; there is a risk that the data could be used for other purposes, including transfer to other services of the US administration;"
"- the number of items of data required (39 elements) is incomprehensible and out of proportion;"
"- the retention of data (6/7 years) is unjustified;"
"- passengers have no effective means of control or extra-judicial appeal."
"US threats to withdraw landing rights from airlines that do not comply with their demands are equally unacceptable."
"We demand that the right to personal data protection should be fully respected and that we should not give in to US demands by trying to establish derogations from the rules that exist in Europe."
"The compatibility of the proposed introduction of so-called European Union passports containing chips with these same rules remains to be debated, however."
". It is vital that we do everything possible in the fight against international terrorism and major criminality and this requires a sensitive balance to be struck between registration and individual freedom."
"Our allies in the United States are heavily committed in the fight against terrorism and we should do everything reasonable to support them."
"This resolution could impede their efforts and the British Conservatives cannot therefore support it."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution because it does not include the amendment which we proposed calling for a ban on the collection and transmission of personal data on passengers to third parties, as demanded by the citizens and, in part, by Article 6, paragraph 2 of Council Regulation 2299/98."
"There are, of course, questions in the resolution as to the advisability of the measure, the introduction of biometric elements in the new passports of EU citizens and the terrorism agreement signed by the Greek Presidency of the ΕU with the USA, but only secondary and insubstantial corrections are proposed as to if records will be kept for three or for six years, if there should be fewer than 39 elements and if passengers will know and agree to have their details on record."
"It is as if protecting privacy were a personal rather than a social and political matter."
"This is yet another attempt to give pseudo-democratic coverage and cultivate self-delusion as to the role of the ΕU and the European Parliament in the global imperialist system."
"What is important to the grass-roots movement is not if the ΕU is playing first or second fiddle, but that, together with the USA, it is carrying out an orchestrated attack on fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms."
". Dictatorships are keen to detain critical foreign visitors at their borders or send them straight home from their airports."
"The United States, too, has a tradition of barring those regarded as enemies or as dangerous influences."
"The most effective way to get into the US as a suspected person is to have one’s visit enforced by means of an extradition order by an American judge."
"Visits of one’s own free will are already in practice affected by the attempt to demand thirty-nine items of personal data on each and every passenger on transatlantic flights, including the choice of meals as a means towards determining whether someone is a Moslem."
"On 20 May, I was one of those who took part in the protest against this at Schiphol airport in the Netherlands."
"Europe cannot prevent the US from refusing entry to visitors from abroad, but that does not mean that the EU itself must cooperate in collecting data of this sort within Europe for the Americans’ purposes."
"Such cooperation is and remains contrary to European standards on the protection of privacy."
"I am glad that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has lent its unanimous support to a ban on the transmission of data by airlines and automated booking systems, if this discriminates against those who are not US citizens, the data is kept for long periods and if information or review procedures are not in place."
"The European Parliament’s resolution concerning the huge mortality rate for bees is fairly disappointing for, once more, it confines itself to evoking only a possible link between these phenomena and the use of certain pesticides, Gaucho and Regent, for the treatment of seeds."
"It proposes that new studies be carried out and a committee of experts put in place."
"As for the urgent provisions, it is content to request, in a very vague and allusive way, ‘preventive measures to be taken to tackle the use of new generations of long-residue neurotoxic products’."
"In the course of the debate prior to this resolution, held on 25 September, I had considered that, at present, the latest studies carried out, like the practical experience of beekeepers, reveal the existence of a direct link between the death of bees and the use of these insecticides."
"That does not mean that other causes, like the general pollution of the towns and countryside, cannot have an influence."
"These causes must not, however, serve to mask the influence of these insecticides."
"Their use must therefore be suspended, at least provisionally, as a precautionary measure."
"Not wishing to add my voice to that of the supporters of a wait-and-see policy, I have nonetheless voted in favour of this resolution which, moreover, has been improved along the way by an amendment by Mr Souchet."
".– We support this proposal for a resolution in general, taking account of the difficulties that beekeepers in the European Union have been facing for years, with the decline in the bee population and the resulting loss of income, aggravated by climate-related constraints, the presence of diseases such as varroasis, and difficult market conditions."
"In addition, the bee population has been declining in certain places at the same time, one cause being the use of systemic neurotoxic pesticides to treat the seeds of certain crops."
"Hence it is necessary to find a solution to compensate beekeepers who are suffering major losses of bees."
"These difficulties were aggravated this year in Portugal as a result of the severe forest fires that swept through the country."
"It is estimated that more than 5 000 hives, especially in the Algarve, the Beiras and Trás-os-Montes, were destroyed by the fires. The direct losses come to roughly EUR 500 000."
"This does not include the damage arising from the loss of future earnings and the destruction of the surrounding areas, which affects the foraging of the surviving populations."
"I am therefore delighted at the adoption of our proposal for the Commission to carry out an overall assessment of the damage and to devise the requisite Community support measures."
"I should like to thank all my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who have helped find a consensus with a view to presenting, today in plenary, a resolution in response to the oral question to the Commission and in response to the debate that took place on 25 September in Strasbourg on the difficulties encountered by European beekeeping."
"This resolution is very balanced, as evidenced by its unanimous adoption by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I hope that this unanimity will finally encourage the European Commission to follow up the requests we have made in our resolution."
"I hope it will cease to ignore the fact that, for years, beekeepers have had to face severe problems connected with losses of their bee populations, amounting in some cases to more than 80%, and with a sharp decline in honey production, leading to significant loss of income."
"More and more beekeepers, in all regions of the European Union, are giving up beekeeping."
"An interesting but difficult profession, young people are not prepared to make it their own."
"Moreover, beekeeping – which has always been practised by many people not only as a source of income but also as a hobby – no longer has the same attraction, particularly because of the difficulties resulting from new diseases."
"Beekeepers keep on sounding the alarm."
"Bee populations have been falling for years in proportions that put pollination at risk."
"Why has this health disaster occurred?"
"No doubt the acarid varroa parasite is partly responsible, as in Germany where, in 2002, it destroyed 40% of the bee population."
"Bayer’s Gaucho (imidaclopride) pesticide and BASF’s Regent (fipronil) pesticide bear a very heavy responsibility for these excessive mortality rates, however."
"The facts speak for themselves. When melliferous, sunflower, maize or rape crops are treated with these pesticides in the vicinity of bee colonies, the latter show serious behavioural problems and die ."
"The precautionary principle therefore requires that, at the very least, these two neurotoxic pesticides be urgently withdrawn in anticipation of serious , and no longer , studies involving biologists specialising in the life of bees and representatives of the beekeepers."
"It is necessary right now to compensate the beekeepers who have sustained losses and to put an end to the unreasonable imports of foreign honey, which is sometimes adulterated and always offered on a dumping basis."
"– We agree with the motion for a resolution because it makes an effort to address the acute problems of apiculture."
"We cannot preclude the possibility that the new generation of insecticides applied mainly using the method of immersing seeds is harmful to the environment and public health, especially when these preparations are used in different countries and after germination in order to combat certain plant enemies, with the result that their residues are greater during blossoming and in the final product."
"That is why controls should also be carried out of post-germination sprayings so that we can improve our knowledge of how these preparations behave so that suitable measures can be taken to protect the environment and public health."
"I am very happy that the resolution drawn up by Mrs Lulling and myself, following the alarming information forwarded to us by European beekeepers, has been adopted with a large majority by our Parliament."
"This resolution has the virtue of setting out clearly the problem of the serious consequences for the health of bees and for the human diet of using the new generations of molecules with powerful neurotoxic effects in the coatings of widely cultivated seeds."
"By presenting it with two main requests, Parliament asks the Commission to overcome its inertia."
"The resolution recognises that the current approval protocols applicable to plant protection products are no longer at all adapted to the new types of molecules appearing on the market and requests that they be updated by providing for specific new tests in connection with the health of bees and the risks of food contamination, given the scientific studies reporting on possible transfers of these molecules to the whole food chain."
"The resolution also requests compensation for beekeepers who have suffered large losses in production, as well as aid in reconstituting the devastated bee populations."
"The ball is now in the court of the Commission whose objective should be to support European honey production."
"We welcome the trend whereby the European Union is setting aside the traditional fisheries agreements in favour of new fisheries partnership agreements with third countries."
"The old fisheries agreements were insufficiently generous towards countries that transferred fishing rights to the EU."
"The new partnership will hopefully lead partly to more sustainable fisheries that take account of third countries’ local needs and partly to these countries’ having the opportunity in the future to exercise control over their fisheries themselves."
".– I voted for the excellent own-initiative report by Mr Arlindo Cunha on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, which underlines the importance of a more active Community policy geared to signing international fisheries agreements."
"These agreements, indeed, give the Community fleet access to third countries’ waters, which is of vital economic importance to my country."
"I must also point out the specific importance that these agreements generally have for the outlying and outermost regions of the European Union and the fact that, as the report states, they provide direct employment for 30 000 people, as well as an even greater number of indirect jobs in ancillary and processing industries."
"These agreements, which account for 20% of the total Community catch, have also been an incentive for the development of the local fishing industries and, insofar as they help boost economic activity and trading volume in the co-signatory countries – developing countries, as a rule – they may prove to be additional valuable instruments for cooperation and dialogue with the European Union."
"I agree with the concerns expressed by the rapporteur that these agreements should be governed by the same criteria of sustainability, conservation of fish stocks and precaution that prevail in fisheries in Community waters, particularly the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Food and Agriculture Organisation – 1995)"
".– ( The common fisheries policy and the Union’s development cooperation policies, through their consistency, complementarity and coordination, must respect the principles of sustainable development while unfailingly contributing to poverty reduction in the countries concerned."
"Traditional fishing by local communities in coastal areas must be protected and preserved because it is essential to the process of harmonious development, while helping to encourage other activities such as tourism and employment."
"– Mr President, I would like to remind the House that during the last part-session in Strasbourg, I spoke on two occasions about Members’ freedom of access to the House."
"We all know about the budgetary situation for the car pool."
"Some Members have found that when they are very short of time, they cannot get a car; they have to take a taxi and then downstairs, even though they say that they are Members, they cannot come upstairs, which takes up more time."
"This was why I was not present for the first roll-call vote today."
"I would urge the Bureau to address this issue of Members’ freedom of access to the House, regardless of whether the situation arises because of a demonstration or for other reasons."
"This is an important issue."
"I read the minutes of the Bureau’s meetings regularly. I read about colleagues who write letters whose content may or may not be important, but I have seen nothing to indicate that certain interventions, notably from Mr Posselt and myself, have been discussed by the Bureau or that we are being offered a reasonable and acceptable answer."
"Thank you for that information, Mr Wieland."
"It is not the Bureau but the College of Quaestors that is responsible for these issues."
"Obviously, I shall pass on your comment to our friends, the Quaestors, as well as to the President."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(1)"
"– I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 9 October 2003.(1)"
"– The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 15 October 2003 has been distributed."
"The following changes have been proposed:(1)"
"As regards the report by Mr Queiró on defence equipment (A5-0342/2003), I have received a request from the UEN Group to refer this report back to committee pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure."
"– Mr President, I have asked for the floor on a point of order. On behalf of my group, I would like to request that a report be referred back to committee, pursuant to Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The facts of the matter are that, following the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy a report was adopted on Community defence equipment policy for which I am rapporteur and which is on the draft agenda for this coming Wednesday."
"The Conference of Presidents had decided – and herein lies the problem – that this report should be drawn up pursuant to Rule 162(a) of the Rules of Procedure, which is to say, according to the procedure for enhanced cooperation between Parliamentary committees."
"Under these circumstances, the Committee on Foreign Affairs was responsible for commenting on the basic texts, and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was responsible for delivering an opinion."
"For reasons linked to how this rule – a recent one, incidentally – was interpreted, the reworded report is incoherent and different from the one adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"With a view to overcoming this difficulty, I would now like to request that the report be referred back to committee."
"Our aim in making this request is not to change what has already been approved in committee, or to call into question the Committee on Industry’s status."
"As I said, we wish to enable the opinion of the Committee on Industry to be coherently incorporated into this report in order to preserve the integrity of the report as a whole, which could not be done in time."
"I appeal to my fellow Members, therefore, to support my request in this instance, since my sole intention is to help solve this problem – which, incidentally, has arisen through no fault of my own – in a constructive fashion."
"– Following the referral back to committee, I have received a request from the PPE-DE Group and the GUE/NGL Group to include, after the debate on the Brok report on Wednesday, Council and Commission statements on the forthcoming EU-Russia summit, including the situation in Chechnya, without motions for resolution."
"– Mr President, the EU – Russia Summit is to be held next week and in Chechnya there have just been elections, which, with the best will in the world, cannot be regarded as quite the sort of presidential elections we in the West are accustomed to."
"On top of everything, Russia is a big superpower, or at least a big country, which is close by to us, and whose affairs we have not really spoken about too much."
"We have discussed issues much less directly relevant to us in separate debates here."
"The situation regarding the war in Chechnya has not changed, and it demands a debate."
"For that reason, I propose a separate debate on it and I, for one, am very much in favour of that."
"With all due respect to these other proposed debates, they are rather less relevant to us in terms of their subject matter."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that anyone could suspect our group or me personally of being opposed to a debate on Chechnya."
"Nevertheless, if we are going to have a debate on Chechnya, I think that it should be on the basis of a resolution."
"This does not make any sense: everyone is aware of the situation."
"For our part, we propose that there be a debate on Chechnya, on the basis of a resolution, at the mini part-session, that is to say in a fortnight's time."
"In any case, if it is topical issues that we are talking about, we ought to have held this debate, and voted on it, at the last mini part-session, whereas now Bolivia actually seems to me to be the most topical issue on which Parliament ought to adopt a position on the basis of a resolution."
"We do not therefore wish to debate Chechnya without a resolution and propose that we do so at the mini part-session, with a resolution."
"– Mr President, it may be possible to reconcile the two positions: firstly, we would accept the joint proposal from our two groups to debate Chechnya on Wednesday afternoon and secondly, we would defer the point on Bolivia to Wednesday evening, which means that it would be addressed in the presence of the Commission only."
"Opting for this solution would, I think, enable us both to express our views on Chechnya and also say what we think about the bloody repression in Bolivia, which, I would remind you, has led to the deaths of almost eighty people in the space of one week."
"(2)"
"Mr President, last Friday, there was an extremely serious incident in Rome, prejudicial to freedom of information in the European Union: a judge ordered the searching of the premises of a major newspaper and the seizing of news material."
"I am speaking as a journalist to a President who is also a journalist."
"The police spent 13 hours at the newspaper’s premises and seized a great deal of material, although the alleged offence is only libel by a newspaper article."
"The Italian judiciary’s decision failed to take into account the decisions of the Council of the European Union and of the European Court of Justice, which have ruled on a number of occasions in favour of journalists’ right not to reveal their sources."
"In this regard, I would mention Recommendation R-2000/7, issued to the Member States on 8 March 2000 by the Council of the European Union, and the well-known Goodwin judgment also comes to mind, in which the Court of Justice enshrined the professional secrecy of journalists in law."
"I would also mention the very recent judgment No 33400 of 15 July 2003, which lays down that searches carried out in workplaces to find journalists’ sources constitute a serious violation of freedom of expression; again, the investigators’ aim of identifying the people responsible for information leaks from the law courts is not sufficient to justify the use of such methods."
"Mr President, I have already tabled a question seeking to safeguard freedom of information both in my country and in the European Union as a whole."
"I call for the European Parliament to intervene in this matter."
"Mr President, I had the opportunity to be in Romania last week, where I observed the preparations for the referendum."
"Allow me to say that the referendum has made a mockery of the application of democratic rights."
"Never have I seen so much fraud in the run-up to a referendum as I have in Romania."
"For example, people taking part in the referendum were promised that their gas and electricity bills would be paid for by the state, and mayors are being offered free trips to China if they actively support the referendum."
"Two hours before the polling stations closed, the turnout was only 45%."
"Moreover, and this is perhaps the worst of all, there was also talk of restricting freedom of speech."
"You do not always have to agree with the views of certain parties, but if you notice that the view of an important opposition party, namely the PRM, is simply removed from the website by government bodies, then Parliament needs to mount an inquiry in order to investigate the irregularities that have occurred during the organisation of this referendum."
"It would be a good thing if we were to act on this, since Romania has, after all, applied to become a Member State."
"Mr President, on Thursday, 9 October, you informed us of the fact that you had received the common position on the revision of legislation on medicines."
"This is important legislation, and if the common position is adopted, the effect will be a significant increase in the price of medicines in a number of countries, not only in the present Member States, but also in the countries that will be joining the EU with effect from May 2004."
"The Public Health Ministers of the ten accession countries recently lodged a complaint against the common position and against the way in which it has been arrived at."
"The accession countries have negotiated the treaties and have taken decisions on the basis of the old legislation."
"This new legislation is a slap in the face for the governments and peoples of the ten new Member States."
"Indeed, it is putting them to great expense without them having any say in the matter."
"This is not exactly an example of proper governance."
"The question is now how we in this House should respond to this."
"We must at any rate find a way of taking proper account of the interests of the new Member States."
"Rule 76 of our Rules of Procedure stipulates that in the common position, reference shall be made to the committee responsible and to the committees asked for their opinion at first reading."
"Given the potentially major implications for the new Member States, it would also be advisable to seek the opinion of this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy at second reading, since this committee is probably best placed to formulate the interests of the new Member States."
"I therefore urge you, in these special circumstances, to seek the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy."
"– That will have to go through the appropriate procedures."
"You have correctly identified the route that needs to be followed in order to deal with the matter."
"Mr President, I am delighted to see that at the European Council meeting in Brussels last week, the 25 Heads of State and Government joined together in congratulating His Holiness, Pope John-Paul II on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of his Pontificate."
"His Holiness is one of the extraordinary figures of the 20th and 21st centuries and we now stand on the threshold of re-uniting a Europe which was divided for nearly half a century."
"The Pope played a significant role in helping to bring down those barriers and close the final sad chapter of World War II."
"I hope, Mr President, that you will send a message on behalf of this House and join with the European Council in congratulating Pope John-Paul and wishing him well as he continues his work for peace throughout the world."
"– Mr Hyland, I communicated sentiments of a similar sort on behalf of the House last Thursday."
"– Mr President, I should like to respond to what Mrs Corbey has just said about the second reading on medicines and draw your attention to the fact that we have some very tight deadlines to respect and that the price of medicines is not taken into account in this second reading; indeed it was not in the first reading either."
"I do not think therefore that we should confuse all of the issues; above all, we must not fall behind schedule, given that the Italian Presidency ends in December and that our work will be completed at the end of April."
"I wanted to draw your attention to this point: it is essential that we have European legislation in the field of pharmaceuticals as soon as possible."
"Mr President, in recent days, 22 people drowned off a Sicilian island, Lampedusa."
"They had come from Somalia and paid USD 1 200 each to come and die in an attempt to reach Europe."
"Since the beginning of the year, 7000 refugees have come ashore on Lampedusa, all fleeing in desperation from places that are not far from Europe."
"It is a tragedy in which we may well be able to offer nothing more than routine and resignation."
"At the Brussels Summit, a number of major European countries refused point blank to consider whether European quotas for legal immigration might be appropriate."
"The Italian Presidency declared that strategic measures combating illegal immigration must be organised at European level rather than Member State level."
"We agree with that, but we can only lament the fact that the Presidency has not be able to overcome this reluctance and achieve something more effective in the summit conclusions than a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration, which will certainly be useful as a study but is a wholly inadequate instrument if Europe is to respond properly to the tragedy."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, with the change in funding for the European documentation networks and the closure of the documentation departments in the representations in the Member States, which are being merged with the corresponding departments of the European Parliament, there is a problem with informing and updating European citizens."
"Under no circumstances should information and documentation be downgraded, especially in the run-up to the forthcoming European elections."
"That is why I am asking you to make sure that their proper functioning is safeguarded for the coming period."
"– Perhaps the Member concerned might like to liase with my office on specific elements of that request."
"But let me assure you that this concern is very much in hand in the Bureau."
"There is an active and determined policy to focus on the issues you have touched on."
"Mr President, I had hoped to catch your eye a bit earlier because this concerns next week's agenda, but I hope you will agree to take the point now."
"It concerns the proposal to have a statement from the Commission on Thursday 6 November 2003, entitled 'Ford workers laid off in Genk'."
"Having worked in the automobile industry for nearly 30 years, I have tremendous sympathy with the workers in Genk and many other employees including those, in my own constituency, who are involved in restructuring of this kind."
"But this is a very specific statement."
"My understanding is that the Ford Genk plant will remain open: this is a question of adjusting production by taking off a shift because Ford wants to match production to demand."
"If we had a debate about every instance of that across the European Union, we would be here debating those issues every day of the week."
"So, can I ask you – and I hope I will have colleagues' support on this – to broaden this statement so that we can all be included, particularly those like myself who have constituents involved in motor vehicle manufacturing."
"Could we ask the Commission to make a statement about employment prospects in the EU automobile sector?"
"That would allow colleagues with an interest in Genk to make their points."
"In that case the Commission does indeed have an interest, but I would merely suggest to you that the Commission has no business or interest in how one company wishes to adjust output to demand."
"We would, however, like to hear about the prospects for a crucial sector."
"So could I ask you, Mr President, on behalf of myself and others, to request the Conference of Presidents to invite the Commission to make a statement on that basis."
"It would be far more satisfactory for all of us to be engaged in that debate."
"– Mr Harbour, I can raise that matter with the Conference of Presidents since there is still some time, but it is not at my personal discretion to change the agenda as adopted by the House."
"– Mr President, my speech, too, concerns the distressing incidents which, I am afraid to say, are becoming more and more frequent along the Italian coasts."
"In Lampedusa, as another Member has said, they are continuing, even now, to take stock of how many victims have been claimed by the latest boat to sink or by what was, at all events, a genuine tragedy."
"Laying the blame at the door of the Italian Presidency would appear to be an unimaginative and certainly unusualway of addressing the issue; it may be that the blame lies with the countries which have not taken on board the recommendations and undertaking of the Italian Presidency, those countries which refuse common rules to control immigration, withdrawing into the ivory tower of their sovereignty."
"However, we, too, have responsibilities, Mr President, and it is with regard to those responsibilities that I want to ask you intervene."
"Parliament is processing dossiers on combating the trafficking of human beings and illegal immigration, on common asylum rules, on integration measures and on aid to third countries to enable them to mount information campaigns and dissuade their citizens from leaving."
"These dossiers are still at a standstill."
"We need to avoid the usual rigmarole of amendments and speed up the process: a crisis must be met with an urgent response, not with the usual irresponsible gentle pace of those who prize bureaucracy above the effectiveness of measures."
"– Since two Members have now touched on this issue, I should like to make a brief comment."
"Since Tampere in October 1999, the European Commission has brought forward a number of proposals for directives."
"In every instance so far, the European Parliament has delivered on time."
"But in six cases where we have done our work, the Council of Ministers has thus far failed to do its work, as I pointed out on behalf of the Parliament at the European Council meeting last week."
"Some of these issues have been outstanding on the Council's agenda for more than two years."
"Yes, there is a problem, but that problem is not in this Parliament, it is with the Council and the Member States."
"– Mr President, in the European Union there is a network of so-called rural , which basically provide European citizens involved in this issue in rural areas with information on agricultural policies."
"There are 138 in collaboration with public and private bodies, none of them profit-making, and they have been very surprised by a decision of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Press and Communication, of 29 September, which withdraws the aid they were receiving to meet the operating costs of these rural centres or ."
"I believe that this Parliament should express its concern, because one of the most important resources we have for coming closer to the citizens is currently being seriously hindered by this Commission decision."
"I would ask you, therefore, to intervene in relation to this issue and to ensure the good functioning of these centres, for the sake of informing citizens in these rural areas and the European Union’s agricultural policies."
"– We can follow up on that, as you request."
"Mr President, the operation to criminalise pacifist action is continuing in Greece with the referral to the courts of 5 peace fighters who, with thousands of others, expressed the opposition of the Greek people to the dirty imperialist war against the Yugoslavian people."
"One aspect of the fight was the blockade on the columns of NATO vehicles, in which the 5 peace fighters also participated."
"Although tried and acquitted, they are being brought to trial again on 29 October."
"Recently, cadres of the All Workers Military Front trade union movement who opposed the violation of workers' and employment rights, the sentences imposed on strikers and the pronouncement of almost all strike action as illegal and abusive, were also convicted."
"We have seen and are seeing similar trials against farming trade unionists."
"This is an effort to terrorise the grass-roots movement and halt its development."
"It comes within the framework of the abolition of employment and democratic rights and freedoms and the imposition of the new order of big business in all sectors."
"Such action must be condemned categorically and measures must be taken to overturn any attempt to curtail democratic rights, which holds a gloomy future in store for us."
"In all events, they will come up against intensified reaction by the workers and our peoples in general."
"– Mr President, I would like to focus my fellow Members’ attention on a certain important question of major significance for the future of this institution: the matter of the Members’ Statute."
"I understand that last week the Committee of Permanent Representatives referred Parliament’s proposal for a new Statute back to Parliament for further debate."
"I would now like to ask here in plenary how Parliament intends to proceed from here so that we may have a new, more transparent and coherent Statute approved before the elections, and what procedure it intends to use to debate this issue so that we may switch to a new and even better system in the forthcoming parliamentary term after the European Parliament elections."
"I would like to hear your opinion, as President, on the matter."
"– And so you shall, but not immediately."
"It deserves some reflection."
"– Mr President, a large number of prospective immigrants drowned recently in the waters off the coast of Sicily."
"When, I wonder, will the institutions of the European Union forego their callous and reprehensible indifference to tragic deaths such as these?"
"Moreover, when, I wonder, will we ourselves, the Members of this Parliament, observe at least a minute’s silence for these poor souls who were looking for a better life in our countries?"
"– Mr President, I should like, as one Member has already done, to draw your attention to a letter that has been sent to the various Info-Points Europe, informing them that they are to lose their funding from the Commission."
"At a time when our democratic deficit is making itself increasingly felt, should we not be welcoming this kind of organisation, a network which functions to general satisfaction, because it is actually a tool for raising awareness about the European idea, notable for its proximity to the public?"
"In fact, at the very moment of enlargement, on the eve of a crucial year for Europe, essential and vital resources are being withdrawn from our best information relays."
"We must also note that this stands in complete contradiction to the new information strategy that was adopted in 2002."
"If the administration considers the entry into force, on 1 January 2003, of the new financial regulation to be reason enough to withdraw these funds, then it should also be aware that it is shaking the confidence both of associations about the work that can be done and of the public authorities, who represent us in this field."
"I should therefore like to know how it might be possible, even before 2004, to envisage a way of supporting this network and subsequently perhaps to consider alternative ways in which it might continue to function."
"– Regarding the points made on information policy, I will discuss the matter with the Vice-President who deals with this, Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca."
"He is also the interlocutor for the European Parliament with the Commission on the issue of information policy."
"We can then come back to the colleagues who have asked these questions."
"Mr President, on Saturday afternoon once again thousands of people filled the streets of San Sebastian in a massive response to the arrest of eight prestigious members of the Basque cultural world, in what could be considered a new round of repression aimed at the two main pillars of Basque society: its language and culture."
"On the orders of Spain's , all those arrested are still being held incommunicado in Madrid, at the headquarters."
"Among those arrested last Thursday at 3 a.m. was Mr Joxemari Sors."
"When the only Basque daily was closed down eight months ago, he wrote an open letter to the Spanish judiciary saying that the newspaper had nothing to hide, but much to reveal if called upon to do so."
"The defencelessness of those working to promote the Basque language and culture clearly shows the authoritarian character of the so-called young Spanish democracy."
"– Mr President, it never ceases to amaze me that a Member of this House, who belongs to an organisation declared illegal as a result of being an extension of the terrorist group ETA, who is subject to legal proceedings in France, who is apparently using the funds allocated to honourable Members in an irregular fashion, should, taking advantage of his status as a Member of this Parliament and protected by the freedom that implies – a freedom over which the terrorist group ETA rides roughshod on a daily basis – try to justify the unjustifiable."
"I would have hoped, Mr President, that he would have condemned the latest attack by ETA which took place this weekend, but it is clear that, from a person whose positions are morally repulsive, who has not been able to condemn the murder of a six-year-old girl or any of the crimes of the terrorist group ETA, it is impossible to expect any comments or behaviour other than the type he has demonstrated here."
"– Mr President, last week, there were presidential elections in Azerbaijan."
"The reports now coming out of Azerbaijan and Baku are very worrying."
"The OSCE believes that electoral fraud took place."
"The opposition leaders were harassed and, following the election, people were killed in riots."
"News is now emerging that thousands of opposition members have been imprisoned."
"I want to call upon you to protest most vigorously, on behalf of Parliament, against what is now happening in Azerbaijan."
"If Azerbaijan wants to become a respected, democratic state, the country must fulfil the most fundamental condition of democracy and hold free and open elections."
"That is something you should convey to the newly elected president, Ilham Aliyev, who is also Vice-President of the Council of Europe."
"I say this as a friend of Azerbaijan."
"I am a committee member of the Azerbaijani-Swedish Friendship Association."
"Mr President, could you please pass this message on to the authorities in Azerbaijan."
"That would be very useful because they listen to us in Europe – they want to be a part of Europe."
"– I am happy to do that."
"– Mr President, various Nobel Prizes have been awarded recently to scientific and literary luminaries, but one in particular deserves a mention here."
"The Nobel Peace Price was awarded to an Iranian lawyer, Mrs Ebadi, who has campaigned tirelessly, boldly and courageously for human rights and women’s rights in her country."
"This prize constitutes a huge boost in the struggle for the emancipation of women in Iran, and in the struggle for democracy against the theocratic rule of the mullahs in that country."
"Mrs Ebadi, therefore, was welcomed by thousands of people, thousands of democrats singing her praises."
"It was thus unfortunate that Iran’s supposedly reformist president, Mr Katami, should have belittled her, telling her that, when all was said and done, the Nobel Prize was not as special as all that. Iranian society as we see it today, therefore, is in ferment."
"It is a society striving for democracy, fighting a battle for freedom, democracy, human rights and women’s rights in Iran. Mrs Ebadi can now take up a commanding position in this battle."
"Mr President, I would be grateful if you would congratulate Mrs Ebadi, because this Nobel Prize deserves a mention here, since it has been awarded to someone engaged in a great cause, one of the causes of this House, the cause of democracy, rights and freedoms."
"– The applause speaks for itself."
"I will indeed communicate with the recipient of the prize on behalf of Parliament."
"Mr President, under Rule 122, I should like to say just one thing about Mr Salafranca's comments a few minutes ago."
"First of all, he did not trust my words, so I am not a trustworthy person for him and I am very proud of that."
"Secondly, he did not say I was lying so what I said was the truth, the plain truth."
"Thirdly, he said that I am outlawed under I do not know how many circumstances, by I do not know how many courts in Spain and France."
"We are certainly outlawed in Spain, by the young Spanish democracy I mentioned."
"But I am sorry, Mr Salafranca, I have no problems outside Spain."
"It seems that there is a slight difference regarding the notion of democracy between Spain and all the other countries in Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr Gorostiaga has referred to the possible problems I may have inside and outside Spain."
"I would like to say to him – since he has mentioned it and since he has referred to this event – that my private car has been blown up in Barajas airport by his friends from the terrorist group ETA."
"I will repeat what I have already said, moreover: Mr Gorostiaga has never once spoken out in this House to condemn the crimes, murders, extortion and shots in the back of the head carried out by his friends and cohorts in the terrorist group ETA."
"I believe that position to be morally repulsive and gutless."
"Furthermore, it is shameful, Mr Gorostiaga, that you should enjoy the freedom associated with being a Member of this House – a freedom over which your friends from ETA ride roughshod every day – and that you use it to make your totally disgraceful outbursts."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0343/2003) by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus) (8243/01/03 – C5-0292/2003 – 2002/0164(COD)) (Rapporteur: Encarnación Redondo Jiménez)."
"– Mr President, when approximately a year ago we voted here on this Parliament's report at first reading and we achieved a sufficient majority to support the thesis I was advocating, I felt as if I had the strong support of the whole of Parliament."
"I was advocating that this Parliament needed to demonstrate political firmness in relation to the proposed Forest Focus Regulation, which the Commission was presenting as a replacement for the two former regulations on pollution: combating pollution in Europe and combating fires in Europe."
"The proposed law presented by the Commission added to these two objectives – ‘pollution’ and ‘fires’ – the study of biodiversity, climate change and carbon retention."
"The Commission said that all of this had to be done with less money – with EUR 51 million – and that, furthermore, the prevention aspect of combating fires would be transferred to rural development."
"In this way, this Parliament abandoned codecision for a mere opinion, without being able to control whether these programmes were going to be complied with or not, since they were being left to the Member States and were being transferred to a regulation whose control by Parliament was reduced to an opinion."
"This Parliament was not therefore politically able to accept that proposal, nor could it accept it when the Council’s common position was communicated and discussed and a small effort was made, of half a million euros, increasing the sum from EUR 13 million to EUR 13.5 million, which represented a minimal effort in terms of assessing our forests."
"It is not sufficient to say that we believe in them, but rather our support should be reflected in a greater budgetary increase, in a greater effort, since this is the only regulation we have for our forests."
"We have held numerous meetings, both with the Council and the Commission, in order to reach an agreement and in order that this may become a significant commitment, and this is going to be achieved tomorrow in this Parliament, God willing."
"A proposal has been received from the Council and accepted in Coreper, which takes account of those principal and priority needs which Parliament had described at first reading."
"Article 1 places the prevention of fires on an equal footing with the other objectives of the Forest Focus Regulation."
"Article 13 sets a budgetary increase, not the amount we would have liked, but sufficient so that we could reach agreement amongst all the Member States, increasing it to EUR 61 million until 2006; in Article 18, Member States are urged to present an assessment of the Regulation before the end of 2005, and the Commission to present new proposals from 2006."
"By means of this agreement, reached amongst the majority of political groups in this House, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to close this regulation at second reading and provide political impetus for European construction."
"It was very difficult for the countries of the European Union, especially those which have been ablaze this summer – in all corners of Europe, but essentially the countries of the south – to understand why prevention should not be included in this regulation."
"The fact that it has been introduced on an equal footing is a cause of satisfaction for us and I would essentially like to thank the Commission, the Commissioner and Marie Claude Blin, for their efforts in reaching this agreement;"
"I would also like to thank the Council, which has worked hard so that we may reach this agreement, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups, who have moved forward so that this agreement would be possible at second reading and so that we would resolve an issue which presented us with a serious problem: combating fires."
". – Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for her report concerning the Forest Focus Regulation on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions, and for her flexibility in presenting the compromise package designed to reach a second reading agreement."
"I would like to recall what Forest Focus is designed to do."
"The regulation aims to set up monitoring and reporting systems to help protect forests."
"Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information, and I firmly believe that we need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level."
"This is also important so that the Community and Member States can implement activities agreed at international level."
"In addition to this core task of monitoring, I want to reassure you that the Commission places great importance on the need to ensure the continuity of the measures covered by the two previous regulations concerning the protection of forests against air pollution and fire."
"For this reason, since early summer, the Commission services have adopted a flexible approach in response to concerns expressed at the first reading stage by Parliament and the Member States."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission can agree to the compromise presented by Parliament and by the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by warmly congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, who has done an outstanding job, with the support, obviously, of Commissioner Wallström."
"I say outstanding because, despite serious initial concerns, we have finally reached this compromise agreement with the Council."
"The European forest is very diverse: from the forests of Scandinavia to those of the Mediterranean, the problems we encounter are completely different."
"This summer, disaster struck southern Europe because of the drought and the heatwave."
"It was therefore important to include fire prevention, which was not at all clear at the outset."
"As Mrs Redondo Jiménez has explained so eloquently, we need to consider all of the different facets of our forests: we need to look at them from an environmental point of view and take into account the problems of pollution, but we also need to consider their economic, touristic and social functions."
"We need to compare different people's experiences and indeed take advantage of the good example set by the Scandinavian countries on forest management, but we also need to see our forests as part of our rural development strategy."
"There is no doubt that a good number of Member States need to reflect on the future of their forests."
"Fire prevention requires us to keep farming our land."
"This should give critics of the common agricultural policy pause for thought."
"The public should also be better informed in risk areas."
"Finally, and above all, replanting of the forests that have been destroyed needs to be carefully thought through and species chosen that are appropriate to the land and climate and more likely to withstand fire."
"We can therefore only welcome the new financial framework for 2003 to 2006, which provides for EUR 61 million, EUR 9 million of which will be allocated to fire prevention."
"At last, we can exercise our full power of codecision because in 2006 we will also be evaluating what we have achieved."
"The negotiations have, it is true, been very lengthy, but the result is important for Europe."
"It is up to us to continue our efforts because, as our Commissioner said, this is an ongoing task."
"– Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this important piece of work."
"Forests are an important natural resource, and their sustainable management is vital, not only for natural diversity and ecological balance but also for our economy and prosperity."
"It is important to establish a common database regarding the condition of the forests and the environmental pollution from which they are under threat."
"This way we would be in a better position to ward off the threats and create a policy which will also safeguard our top quality forest resources in the future."
"During Parliament’s debate the prevention of forest fires was added to the group of activities to be funded out of the programme in the Commission proposal."
"At the same time, Parliament has also been prepared to increase programme funding as part of the intergroup compromise."
"The Council in its common position was strongly opposed to both these points: both the inclusion of fire prevention activities and an increase in funding."
"The debates, however, have seen a clear convergence of opinion."
"Parliament, and the Commission too, have worked hard to bring the Council closer to Parliament’s position."
"Now we have to see to it that there is consensus right to the end."
"If Parliament’s intergroup compromise is jeopardised in any way in tomorrow’s vote, the implementation of the entire plan will also be jeopardised, so I hope that the spiritual powers the rapporteur called upon will be present tomorrow in the vote."
"As part of the compromise, too, the programme will cease at the end of 2006."
"The Commission should put forward a proposal to continue with action to protect forests from atmospheric pollution and other phenomena that weaken them."
"We nevertheless have to bear in mind how diverse the European forests are."
"Fire prevention activities must be carried out by means of regional programmes in order to be able to address the most outstanding problems of each region and so that the activities involved are suited to forest types and climate."
"It is also important that the people in a region can become involved in these programmes."
"For this reason, when this programme work is undertaken in the future, these matters I think should be highlighted very clearly, and I believe that the Member States will supply valuable information before the Commission then puts forward its own proposal for after 2006."
"– Mr President, I must congratulate Mrs Redondo on the modification she has made in relation to forests."
"My group and I are going to support her, and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Wallström on her speech."
"She is always so concerned and sensitive in relation to all environmental problems, as she has demonstrated in her speeches on the Spanish state and its distribution of water."
"I agree with the whole of the report. I believe that the increase by millions of euros for the reconstruction of forests struck by disasters is extremely sensitive, but I believe that there must be democratic control in all the countries of the Mediterranean so that the investments of this Parliament in relation to information, prevention and repopulation are properly complied with, because otherwise we may find in a few years’ time that we have not moved forward, and that we are still affected by the atmospheric situation, by global warming and by bad management on the part of the Member States."
"We have been talking about diversity of forests throughout the whole of the European Union and we therefore believe that we must create a common forest policy for the whole of Europe."
"– Mr President, climate change, the heatwave, and ecological delinquency: all these phenomena have brought catastrophe this summer, all of them need to be combated at every level, and this report is just one of many ways of doing so."
"At the end of the day, the amounts at stake are modest and perhaps did not merit all of the political wrangling to reach this compromise."
"Nevertheless, the Greens are satisfied with the compromise that has finally emerged."
"In our view, this report could have been settled long ago, but we are reassured because the programme will, at long last, be able to be launched."
"It could have started as early as 2002."
"We also wish to remind you that the measures in this programme are transitional ones and that the countries that have not invested in fire prevention would be well advised to do so before the review in 2006."
"We want the EU to find a happy medium at the next review, so as to strike a balance precisely between the two extremes: the countries of the North, which support subsidiarity in forest policy, and those in the South, which perhaps tend rather to knock on the door of the European treasury when problems arise."
"Finally, where the projects are concerned, we would ask that one of the factors in the selection process be biodiversity, because although it is true that it is difficult to explain what biodiversity is, we are very well aware of how important it is in the forestry environment."
"Reforestation, for example, should take the form of restoring the forest biodiversity that was damaged, if not totally destroyed, in the fires this summer."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this speech to welcome the progress made in the interinstitutional dialogue and the compromise which I believe has been reached."
"As at first reading, our group strongly supported the amendments tabled in Parliament, especially those of Mrs Redondo Jiménez, whom I congratulate on her work."
"These amendments concentrated on three central concerns of this new Forest Focus programme: the need to pay due attention to preventing forest fires, the need for the budgetary framework to be more open, and the need to pay clearer attention to the principle of subsidiarity."
"We supported the bulk of the amendments, therefore, both those tabled by the Commission and the other proposals by certain fellow Members of this House, some of whom are members of my own group."
"News of this compromise is welcome. It follows on from the debate held here last February at first reading, and is especially pertinent given the heightened awareness of this issue in the wake of this summer’s disasters."
"I would simply like to use this opportunity to remind you of some of the resolutions we have adopted recently."
"In September the European Parliament insisted on the need to continue pursuing an effective prevention policy against forest fires, and reaffirmed that the Community should promote monitoring and prevention measures, especially within the framework of the Forest Focus Regulation. It insisted on the need to reallocate to the European Union the same financial resources approved under Regulation No 2158/92 on protection of the Community’s forests against fire, particularly with a view to financing appropriate measures to prevent forest fires, such as lines, firebreaks, forest trails, access points and water-points."
"Even more recently, during the October part-session, when we mobilised the Solidarity Fund, this point was reiterated."
"I welcome the fact, therefore, that the Council and the Commission have finally become more open to Parliament’s continual requests and have allayed one of European public opinion’s great concerns."
"– Mr President, first of all, I wish to convey my thanks to Mrs Redondo Jiménez for the sound work she has done on Forest Focus."
"Allow me to make it clear that we fully support that part of the regulation concerning protection against forest fires."
"I nonetheless consider the new parts of the regulation concerning soil strategy and the monitoring of biodiversity to be issues for each and every Member State."
"Forestry production in southern Spain and northern Scandinavia cannot be compared with each other."
"Finland and Sweden together account for 40% of European forestry production, and that is the backbone of the biggest export business in these countries."
"Sweden has a forestry law that is a hundred years old this year."
"Most forests are now certified, which means that forest owners themselves take responsibility for biodiversity."
"Responsibility at local level is best."
"The European Union cannot, on this issue, be controlled in its entirety from Brussels."
"The Member States’ national forestry strategies and laws must be all-embracing, and the individual forest owner must have control of what he rightfully owns."
"– Mr President, as you know, countless regions of southern Europe were severely affected this summer by unprecedented forest fires."
"In its resolution on the effects of the summer heatwave, adopted on 4 September, a substantial majority of this House voted in favour of an amendment tabled on the initiative of my colleague Mr Savary, with the support of thirty-one Socialist Members, of whom I was one, insisting that the European Union be granted the same financial resources as it had under the regulation on protection of the Community's forests against fire, in particular so as to fund appropriate facilities to prevent forest fires, such as firebreaks, forest tracks, access points and water supply points."
"Allow me therefore to express my delight that the Council, thanks I might add to the perseverance of our rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, is now finally acknowledging, at least to some extent, that our arguments are valid."
"We will in fact be asked to vote tomorrow on two amendments that partially meet our concerns."
"We therefore note that a step has been taken in the right direction."
"For all that, is it sufficient?"
"Forest fires should remain one of our political priorities, one of the symbols of the solidarity between northern and southern Europe."
"I very much hope, therefore, that during the Commission's evaluation exercise in December 2005 the issue of an independent, European budget line, devoted to preventing forest fires, will again be raised, and that this will be done in close cooperation with all of the stakeholders, first and foremost the foresters."
"We ought therefore, without prejudice of any kind, to consider whether the choice that is being made today is not to the detriment of a general safety policy, a policy that had proved to be very effective and was a visible sign of the European Union's presence in our regions."
"Mr President, the change in the definition from ""forest ecosystems"" to ""forests"" is a step backwards scientifically, in that ""forest ecosystem"" is scientifically a much fuller term."
"In addition, a forest ecosystem does not qualify as such merely by reason of the fact that it measures half a hectare; a set of criteria and preconditions are needed in order for an area to qualify as a forest ecosystem."
"Moreover, the report makes no reference to forests which have shrubbery and where trees account for less than 10%."
"Tens of millions of acres of forest ecosystem in my country, which are today protected by Greek legislation and are a basic protected factor, according to recent announcements by the government on the bill which, basically, brings Greek legislation into line with the proposed directive, are in danger of becoming the object of exploitation, with incalculable consequences on the forest ecosystem, on the subsoil, on water retention and on preventing floods and enriching the water table."
"Any so-called forestry policy to date – and I quote my country as a typical bad example – has failed to address the basic problems of forest ecosystems; on the contrary, they have contributed to the privatisation of the forests, hence the large number of arson attacks, given that we are talking about fires, the rapid appearance of big business and speculation in ecosystems of huge size and importance, such as national trust lands and so on, and appropriations and changes of use, in the aim of stepping up speculation by making use of them for tourist and housing purposes."
"Finally, mere lip service is being paid to a greater interest in forest ecosystems; in fact, the application of more general policies and economic options is hardening, with more suffocating control and complete indifference as to the peculiarities and actual requirements of the forest ecosystems of the Member States, again serving speculation by big business."
"– Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her splendid work in drawing up the report on the Forest Focus programme."
"It is excellent that the European Union is taking this important step to improve the condition of our forests and support a better and diverse forestry policy in all the Member States."
"For the Nordic countries, and Finland in particular, forests are especially important for recreation and the economy but also for nature conservation."
"The forests in the EU Member States are very different from one another owing, for example, to local natural conditions."
"The social significance of forests and the principal reason they are needed also vary in different parts of Europe."
"Last summer we saw what sort of massive destruction forest fires cause."
"I am glad that Parliament has now also given attention to forest fire prevention in addition to monitoring activities."
"In particular I would like to express my support for Amendment No 19, which concerns the status of the Standing Forestry Committee."
"In my opinion, the Standing Forestry Committee should be involved in this programme and take account of coordination of forestry issues at EU level."
"The forthcoming enlargement of the EU will also mean the coordination of forestry policy will have to be improved."
"There are big differences between the current and the new Member States with regard to the forest ownership structure, and in the promotion of private forestry, for example, we Finns could be active in offering expert help to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the basis of our experience."
"Amendment No 4, which emphasises the multifunctional role of forests, is also welcome in my view."
"This is important, just as Amendment No 15 regarding compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is, because they both highlight the differences between forests and our regional and climatic conditions."
"The scheme quite rightly supports national forestry policies in Member States whilst respecting the specific ecological characteristics of the remoter regions of the EU."
"In future we have to stress the primary importance of national measures and the rules relating to the management of forests."
"The creation of norms and regulations governing the management of forests must in future, I think, fall within the powers of decision of each Member State."
"In this respect I also want to support the view of my colleague, Peder Wachtmeister, that the sustainable use of forests and decision-making in forestry matters are above all the responsibility of the forest owner."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our forests are an invaluable and irreplaceable part of the heritage of humanity and of all living things."
"Protecting and preserving them is essential to our survival."
"We all know how important forests are to the planetary balance, to biodiversity and to economic activity, not to mention the aesthetic and environmental benefits they bring."
"Europe is concerned about the future of its forests and must start by using the way it protects its woodland areas to set an example. This applies from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, since the problems of our forests know no frontiers."
"The Forest Focus Regulation seeks to draw on the experience of two previous regulations in order to create a long-term monitoring system designed to assess the state of the European Union’s forest ecosystem."
"It also reveals lofty ambitions, aiming to embrace fields such as pollution, climate change, biodiversity, natural resources and soils."
"This is all well and good, but the regulation did have two weaknesses."
"The first was the cut in the total funding for achieving these lofty ambitions, a cut rendered scarcely less swingeing by the compromise obtained."
"The second weakness was the sacrifice of the fire prevention measures recommended for rural development programmes."
"The reintroduction of the fire-fighting dimension appeases us: progress has undeniably been made."
"The Commission promised that when it presented its communication on forestry strategy, as it is scheduled to do by the end of this year, it would include a proposal on plans for protection against fires. It goes without saying that that was not enough for us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, our particular sensitivity to the issue of fires is understandable."
"The images of last summer’s towering infernos, which left a swathe of destruction in their wake, especially in Portugal, are still very vivid for us. The memory of such flames cannot easily be snuffed from the mind, or from the landscape."
"– Mr President, forest fires are indeed a scourge which destroys thousands of hectares of woodland throughout the European Union every year, especially in southern countries."
"As we know, not only was this year no exception to that rule, but the situation reached tragic proportions in southern countries, and especially in Portugal, where 20 people died, 45 000 lost their sources of income, and it is estimated that more than 11% of woodland was consumed by the fires. The total cost is more than EUR 1.3 billion in direct damages."
"This disaster provides ample proof that the European Union needs to promote measures for fighting forest fires, particularly at the level of prevention."
"A large majority in the European Parliament used the resolution of 4 September 2003, on the consequences of the summer heat wave, to indicate that that was its understanding of the situation. That resolution asked not only for more funds to bolster the Forest Focus programme, but also for the inclusion in that programme of adequate prevention measures consonant with the actions laid down in Regulation No 2158/92, which expired on 31 December 2002."
"I would also like to remind you that not all the fire prevention measures included in that regulation are covered by the forestry-related actions laid down in the recent Regulation No 1999/1257, on rural development."
"I mention this because continuity is important in relation to prevention measures, which are even more urgent under the present circumstances."
"The rapporteur rightly reiterates her insistence on including the prevention-related amendments tabled at first reading and then rejected by the Council."
"She also asks for an increase in the amounts for financing the Forest Focus programme."
"These are positive proposals which should be adopted once more by this Parliament and which I support. Moreover, I regret the fact that the final compromise does not consider all of these measures together."
"I feel that the need to preserve the heritage of our forests, combined with the high-risk situation of many woodland areas, means that the Council must accept these amendments, tabled by Parliament, on prevention and financing."
"Mr President, first I wish to congratulate Mrs Redondo on her work and efforts and on the passion with which she has supported the obvious."
"No wise man would deny that the value of forests is priceless."
"They have an environmental, a climatic, a health, an economic, a social, a cultural and, still more, a historic value."
"So when you have something which is priceless to look after, it is unacceptable to make comprises as regards the economic dimension of what you have to look after and the measures you take."
"Allow me to remind you that, 5 000 years ago and more, the ancient Greeks had put the care of the forests into the hands of the gods, while we compromise on what funds we shall make available – more or less – to save and look after this priceless, God-given treasure."
"In all events, we must nonetheless be decisive in recording both the state of the forests and the information which is needed so that we can identify the cause of fires."
"We must fight the causes at their root if we are to be able to save the forests."
"We need to make an effort to increase citizens' sensitivity in the approach to and use made of forests."
"We must make provision for measures which will not allow fires to break out or to spread if they do break out."
"We must look after the forests and, finally, we must realise that forest fires do not obey the Schengen regulation."
"They pass borders without any control and the fires themselves have no borders."
"That is why there must be very close and very efficient cooperation between countries which belong to the European Union and others which do not belong and we must help each other to bring about the best possible result."
"– Mr President, in the wake of the fires which ravaged Portugal last summer, laying waste more than 10% of the country, it has become increasingly obvious that the disaster could have been avoided, to a great extent, by means of effective prevention measures."
"It brings to mind the old proverb, ‘prevention is better than cure’."
"During his visit to the regions affected by the fires, Commissioner Barnier himself drew attention to this consideration."
"It has become abundantly clear that we need monitoring systems, but above all that we need to guard against the causes of woodland decline."
"Only by studying the causes and their effects will we be able to mount a relentless campaign to fight the fires."
"The prevention measures, therefore, aim to reduce the size of the affected areas, fight the causes of fire and monitor our forests."
"The European Union cannot content itself with monitoring the fires and taking action after the disaster has occurred."
"What is needed is a real prevention policy."
"The task, then, is not to impose unwanted measures on Portugal, but rather to devise tangible, robust courses of action that are compatible with the national forestry strategy currently being devised."
"I would argue, therefore, that prevention should form an integral part of the Forest Focus programme, regardless of the regulation on rural development."
"When dealing with an issue as important as forests, one of Europe’s treasures, one cannot consider skimping on a few pennies."
"With a view to financing these prevention measures, therefore, I have already proposed increasing the amounts in the European Union’s general budget, by means of the financial perspective for the period up to 2006."
"No preventive measure can truly come into operation unless it is supported by adequate financial resources."
"Finally, I could not end this speech without congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, for the sensitive manner in which she has dealt with what is a most delicate issue for Portugal."
". – Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for all their interesting and important comments."
"Mr Folias, you are absolutely right that we cannot trust the gods to take responsibility for the forests."
"This summer's events – with such huge forest fires in Portugal and other countries – demonstrate that."
"I can, of course, see the link to climate change, where I guess the gods are crying over what we are doing to this planet and to our climate."
"A second reading agreement is needed to ensure the continuity of the measures which have been carried out over a period of more than 15 years."
"A loss of one year over the monitoring of forest fires and the air pollution effects on forests would of course mean an information gap which can only be filled after several years of additional efforts."
"This must be avoided."
"The compromise approach would give the European Commission the time to reflect – together with Member States and stakeholders – on ways in which forest fire risks might be minimised, and on the possibilities of improving prevention measures in the most appropriate way after 2006."
"In this sense, I would encourage Members of the European Parliament to support the compromise proposal which aims to reach broad consensus."
"I should like to thank both the rapporteur and all Members once again."
"– Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (Α5-0335/2003) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the quality of bathing water."
". – Mr President, the hot summer weather all over Europe saw bathing sites visited by tourists and by local people who enjoy the pleasures of bathing in clean water."
"Unfortunately, there are some risks linked to bathing in natural waters."
"Bathing waters may be contaminated by bacteria which originate from households, hotels or maybe office buildings."
"Agriculture may also be a source of contamination and cattle and livestock can pollute rivers and lakes."
"As a consequence, where they are placed at risk bathers may contract gastro-enteritis, ear or eye infections, or even more serious illnesses."
"To reduce the risks related to bathing, a bathing water directive was introduced in 1976."
"This directive has performed particularly well, and nowadays almost 95% of Europe's bathing waters conform to the quality standards it laid down, as opposed to only 60% ten years ago."
"Still, we have to look to the future."
"The current bathing water directive is based on health and hygiene standards from the 1960s and these have since evolved."
"Social standards have also changed and these days public information and involvement have become cornerstones of good governance."
"The legislative-style approach at the heart of the 1976 directive is outdated, since it is based only on monitoring and on measuring, not on the proactive and sound management of bathing waters."
"These are just a few of the reasons why the Commission organised the long and thorough public and stakeholder consultation and came up with a new proposal for a bathing water directive which seeks a common and comparable level of protection for all EU waters and all bathers, whether in major tourist resorts or in traditional local bathing sites."
"This new proposal supports the concept of beach management and public information and participation, but most of all it stands for stricter health standards, thanks to which our children will be able to bathe in safer waters, reducing risks of illness linked to bathing."
". Mr President, as the Commissioner rightly stated, the current bathing water directive, dating back to 1976, is out of date."
"It is an inflexible directive based on obsolete data."
"However, we have to admit that this old directive is popular among Europeans, and indeed, the Commissioner was right to point out that it has been successful."
"It is clearly thanks to this old directive that much of the bathing water that was polluted not so long ago is now much cleaner."
"The proposal for revision, submitted by the Commission, is more flexible; it takes the inflexibility out of the existing directive and is, as such, an improvement."
"Of the nineteen parameters that were required for measurement in the old directive, only two remain, which is actually adequate to achieve the result that is required."
"Since 1976, which is before the European Parliament was directly elected for the first time, our thinking about the environment, but also about issues such as subsidiarity, has, of course, fundamentally changed."
"We should, therefore, question whether the Union should, in fact, decide about what the quality of bathing water should be, whether Europe is better equipped than the Member States to do this, and whether there is a cross-border effect."
"During the initial discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I called these aspects into question and I have to say that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy answered 'yes' to all of those questions and affirmed that it is necessary to uphold such a directive and to improve it."
"My own group does not agree with this and has therefore tabled an amendment."
"In any case, this forces us to revisit this question of subsidiarity."
"Moreover, the committee itself was also somewhat confused."
"After all, in the directive, reference is made to the interests of tourism, but this also touches upon an internal market directive, while surely, as everyone knows, we are dealing here with a directive that should actually protect public health."
"However, the legal basis of the directive is the environment."
"In short, there is confusion all round."
"In actual fact, I am wondering whether it is not simply the case that we are keeping this directive, not because of a need, but simply because it is there."
"The provision of information is crucial."
"There is no doubt in my mind too that here lies an essential European task, namely consumer protection and information which should be more easily accessible to bathers and users of bathing water."
"This can be done via the Internet, but I myself do not always have my laptop on the beach, so alternatives will need to be sought to make it obvious to bathers whether the water is clean or not."
"In this context, the system of smileys, for example, proposed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, strikes me as excellent."
"It should be up-to-date information, that is, not last year's information, but current, weekly information, because this would actually be of some use to bathers."
"This information must be universally accessible."
"We could copy the example of the blue flag."
"Although this is not an EU initiative, it is nonetheless a well-known, popular and effective system."
"The drawback of the blue flag is that it is only introduced upon application and as such, cannot be found in bathing sites that have made the conscious decision not to apply for it."
"In addition, blue flags cost money."
"The question is whether the quality of bathing water will improve purely on the basis of this improved information."
"Take the blue flag as an example, and see how it upsets bathing sites when they lose their blue flag."
"Would this not have a better effect than tightening the standards all the time?"
"The proposed higher standards are, in my view, rather open to question anyway."
"Both the EU's own scientific committee and the World Health Organisation take the view that it is, in fact, impossible to establish scientific standards at international level, given the huge national differences."
"As a result, the higher standards are somewhat questionable."
"Above all, I feel sorry for those governments who say that they are in favour of higher standards as long as they do not need to adhere to them."
"I understand that this is also an argument that is heard in different quarters in the Council."
"I think this is wrong."
"If they say that they want stricter standards, fine."
"But they should, of course, adhere to them too."
"Those stricter standards mean that, for example, in the United Kingdom, or in my own country, the Netherlands, 30% of the bathing water that is still considered good would then become 'bad'."
"What will the Commission do then?"
"Will we be inundated with infringement proceedings?"
"Will we be closing beaches?"
"Are we not more likely to run the risk that such beaches will simply no longer be designated as bathing water, while people continue to swim in it?"
"The public health effect is therefore not achieved by prescribing higher standards."
"As far as this is concerned, we would have also preferred a cost-benefit analysis by the Commission."
"Where, for example, are all those sick tourists now on which these higher standards are based?"
"According to scientists, these sick tourists should be around, but we have not seen any of them, not even a glimpse."
"The question is whether we have found a solution to a problem or whether we have created a problem for a solution that was there all along."
"It remains, of course, to be seen whether the new Member States can meet these old standards, never mind the new ones."
"Finally, I should like to say that I am pleased with the compromise tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"It leads to better information to bathers and to other recreational users, better bathing water quality and also to deregulation and simpler legislation."
"Together with the improvements introduced by the Commission, I think that, on balance, we will arrive at improved legislation after all, on the understanding, of course, that Europe should legislate in this area."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, bathing water is making waves."
"Every year, at the onset of summer, the Commission draws up, on the basis of the 1976 directive, the survey of bathing waters."
"Not only does the European public take note of this information, but over two million visits are also made to the relevant websites."
"It is an established fact that bathing waters have become substantially cleaner right across Europe."
"In 2002, despite positively diluvian rainfall and flooding, as much as 98.5% of Europe’s coastal waters complied with the directive’s specifications."
"There are several reasons why it makes sense to revise the directive after over a quarter of a century."
"Scientific and technical knowledge have expanded at breakneck speed, any revision is to draw on the experience of up to twenty-six years of applying the directive in practice – dependent on the length of time the country has been a Member State of the European Union, the water framework directive is to be harmonised with the bathing water directive, protection of the health of bathers is to be further improved, and, last of all, the simplification of the existing laws is worth striving towards."
"My group shares the Commission’s intention to improve the quality of bathing water."
"Bathing should be promoted as a sensible leisure activity, as should the use of bathing waters for tourism in all our Member States."
"It is evident from what is now many years of experience that the greatest dangers to human health when bathing are presented by faecal matter finding its way into bathing waters as a result of inadequate treatment of waste water or from stock rearing."
"The new rules are intended to reduce from 19 to 2 the number of parameters to be measured and to treat intestinal enterococci and as leading indicators; these two standards are to be made substantially more rigorous, but, by way of contrast, chemical parameters are disregarded and are no longer to be measured, as they are governed by other directives."
"Samples are to be taken less frequently if a constantly high level of water quality is found over a period of three years."
"The quality of bathing water is to be ascertained on the basis of changes over the past three years and no longer on the basis of one single year, so one-off eventualities – such as poor weather conditions – will be less markedly apparent."
"These factors would also reduce the costs involved in implementing the directive in the Member States."
"Our group also sees it as important that the provision of information on water quality should be improved, and that it should be more extensively disseminated via the media and the Internet."
"With that in mind, we endorse the Commission’s objective and also the amendments tabled to that end."
"Our amendments, however, are intended to bring about objectivity and simplicity and, above all, to avoid further increases in costs; hence, we do not want leisure activities to be included, and the management policies required strike us as every bit as over-the-top as the newly-introduced bathing water profiles These measures will help make matters simpler in so far as they dovetail with the water framework directive; otherwise, our group takes the view that the principle of subsidiarity requires that local and regional circumstances be taken into account and dealt with in a flexible way."
"Some of the Commission’s proposals already run counter to these considerations, but a number of amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy even more so, and so we want to vote against these items."
"I see it as important that all the Member States have gathered a great deal of experience, and I take the view that we should stop trying to reinvent the wheel."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to say thank you to Mr Maaten for his constructive cooperation on this matter."
"I should also like to say thank you to the Commission, which I think has come up with a very balanced proposal for the new bathing water directive which takes account of developments over the last 26 years."
"I think it is right to limit the number of parameters, and I also think that the correct limit values for bacteria content have been found."
"I also think that we in the committee have adopted some improvements, and I should like to draw attention to a few of these."
"We have secured a sound context in the shape of the water framework directive and, above all, we have ensured that there is reliable, comprehensible information for people, including bathers, about the quality of bathing water without our rushing into having enormous flag displays on our beaches."
"I also think it is right also to include other leisure activities, such as windsurfing, in the directive."
"A lot has happened in the 26 years since the first bathing water directive was drafted."
"I think that the new directive has been designed in such a way, and with such a code of practice, as to enable the individual Member States reasonably to administer it."
"The last thing I want to emphasise is that a majority of us in the committee reached the view that the bathing beaches or bathing waters concerned must be those that attract large numbers of bathers so that, in this case too, we support the Commission’s definition of what kind of bathing waters we are talking about."
"I think that this rule too is one that the national authorities will be able reasonably to administer."
"I should like to warn against two of the amendments tabled."
"The first is Amendment No 19 on transitory contamination."
"It is a proposal whereby the authorities would now be able to disregard water samples, even if they revealed contamination and health hazards, if the same authorities simply choose to characterise the contamination as transitory."
"The arrangement would mean that bathers would be in danger of being told that the bathing water in question was of good or excellent quality, even if the water were in reality contaminated."
"This would be an impairment of the directive, and I hope the proposal is not adopted."
"I understand that transitory contamination is partly a Scottish problem, and I think that, if there are problems on some Scottish beaches, these should be solved in Scotland, rather than have the reduction in bathing water quality extended to the whole of Europe."
"The second proposal to which I wish to draw attention is Amendment No 76 concerning the definition of bathing water."
"It is a definition that would lead to the authorities having to go out on a daily basis to count the number of bathers on the beaches."
"There would have to be more than 100 bathers a day for at least 20 days a year."
"I think this amendment should be rejected for a number of reasons."
"First of all, it would involve giving unduly detailed direction to the Member States in a way that would be entirely contrary to the principle of subsidiarity."
"Secondly, it would, in my view, be practically impossible to administer."
"Who on earth would count the bathers every day out on the beaches of Europe."
"I would say that, if this proposal is adopted, we shall simply be a laughing stock throughout Europe."
"Mr President, the quality of bathing water has improved."
"The water is better and cleaner in the Netherlands and in the rest of Europe."
"A new bathing water directive is now before us with less red tape, with only two parameters left, but with stricter standards, which is to be welcomed."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has struck sensible compromises."
"Mr Maaten, the rapporteur, wanted, and still wants, to abolish this directive."
"Fortunately, the Liberals are on their own with this view."
"Europe is more than a market and currency."
"The Netherlands will need to make an effort to comply with both the old and the new directive, and take action instead of moaning."
"Thanks to the warmer climate, people will swim more frequently and other types of water recreation will also be introduced."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are good, except for Amendment No 19."
"For the sake of a few hundred Scottish sheep, there is a huge loophole in legislation."
"Intensive farming in the Netherlands also suffers from the spread of disease during heavy rainfall."
"In the Netherlands, the cows became ill and measures were taken."
"This should be our response, and not an enormous loophole in what, let me add, is also sound legislation."
"Mr President, this is an appropriate time to discuss the Commission proposal."
"The old directive took account of pollution levels that, fortunately, no longer exist."
"Ninety to ninety-five per cent of bathing water complies with the standards."
"It is time we moved the bar up a few notches and looked for new challenges."
"Accordingly, I support the tightening of the standards and do not back the rapporteur's proposal to weaken them."
"After all, even with these new standards in place, 1 in 20 bathers fall ill, so the standards are certainly not too high."
"The Commission proposal also contains less successful features, one of which is the definition of 'bathing water'."
"Water becomes bathing water when a large number of bathers are in it."
"It is not clear what constitutes a large number."
"The Spanish costas are peopled by tens of thousands of bathers, the Finnish lakes by a few individuals."
"Yet, both must fall within the scope of the definition."
"The Commissioner could perhaps explain how this should be done in practice."
"Attention still needs to be given to how the public are to be provided with information."
"The Commission's website is, in itself, a good initiative, but who takes their computers with them to the beach?"
"This is why the placing of signs with information at the relevant locations – although labour-intensive in terms of maintenance – is the best solution, because it will reach the highest number of bathers."
"– Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on the conclusion in his explanatory statement."
"He states, namely, that proactive water policy has a positive impact on the well-being of recreational water users, and I could not agree with him more."
"He also ties this in with a better provision of information for the recreational water users."
"I think that the directive should definitely be revised in this area."
"Casting my mind back, however, I notice that we still have problems with the old bathing water directive."
"I still remember the nightly debates in the Dutch Lower Chamber, when we discussed the introduction of the then directive."
"It has to be said that, at present, infringement proceedings are still pending against the Netherlands by the European Commission, because the quality of our inland bathing waters is not up to standard."
"There are also major discrepancies in Europe."
"In the Netherlands, there are 557 designated inland bathing waters, in Great Britain only eleven; there are nine in Ireland and four in Greece."
"Stricter quality is now being enforced – I have nothing against stricter quality – and Parliament would like to extend the directive's scope to include all forms of recreation."
"However, if we want to protect all recreational water users who ingest water at European level, then I think we are going one step too far, even if I would want to give these tourists, these recreational water users, these bathers nothing but the best quality."
"With these higher standards, I think that many of our bathing waters will no longer receive the 'bathing water' label, at any rate not in the Netherlands."
"I think, then, that we should all take another good look at the amendments and ask ourselves how much we would exactly stand to gain from them."
"Things have to improve, we need better information and more streamlined legislation, but I think that the introduction of higher standards at this moment in time, given the proceedings that are still pending, is taking matters too far."
"– Mr President, the Commission’s proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water will be an improvement on the current situation, as has been said here, but there are still problems attached to it."
"The question remains as to how we take account of the fact that bathing waters and bathing facilities vary from one European region to another."
"In the Commission proposal a bathing site falls within the scope of this directive when a large number of people go there."
"It has already been said here that it is quite difficult to say what a large number actually means: a large number where there are a lot of people, or a large number where, for example, there are 20 kilometres of beach per inhabitant and public right of access?"
"How, moreover, do we define a bathing site and ensure that attending to measurements and water quality does not become too bureaucratic?"
"My friend, Torben Lund, here thought it absurd to have a proposal that defines a bathing site according to how many bathers go there, and according to which the authorities must define it as a bathing site."
"In my view, it is just as absurd for the Commission to take Finland to court because measurements have not been carried out there with respect to some beach that everybody knows to be clean, and where the quality of the water is even known to be excellent, just because the definition of a bathing site has these problems associated with it."
"I hope that this kind of flexibility is brought to the directive in the proper way, but at the same time I hope that these issues of public health with regard to the citizens of Europe are also taken proper account of in this directive."
"– Mr President, what constitutes good quality bathing water, and who should decide?"
"These are the kinds of questions that arise from the Maaten report on the proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water."
"Bearing in mind that neither public health nor tourism are Community competences, but remain the competence of the Member States, does Europe have to legislate on this matter and on what basis?"
"In my opinion, the only argument in favour is that the public is better informed."
"But why make the microbiological thresholds more stringent while not providing for any threshold for chemical quality?"
"It is also important to underline the difficulty of compiling an inventory of all sources of pollution, particularly in estuaries, which are located at the outlets of very large catchment areas drained by rivers."
"Why extend the directive to water sports and other recreational activities?"
"Is the intention, in the long term, to ban surfing, windsurfing, kayaking and rowing because the water is deemed to be unsuitable for bathing?"
"These activities are often enjoyed in places other than in bathing water and sometimes out of season."
"Why centralise the data on the Commission site, which seems to be costly and of limited benefit?"
"Who takes their computer with them on holiday to find out whether they can bathe within microbiological safety limits?"
"Local radio and the traditional display signs, which are easy to update, are, in my view, quite sufficient to inform the general public."
"Finally, the proposal to define a beach as a place usually visited by more than 100 bathers for at least 20 days during the bathing season is bordering on the ridiculous."
"Who is going to be counting?"
"As usual, of course, no one is mentioning the cost of the measures or the substantial economic impact that a ban on bathing would have."
"It is not up to the directive to set out the cases in which bathing will be prohibited, as this decision should be the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"Even if it does make waves, we should respect subsidiarity, all the more so when the WHO has just published a practical guide to bathing water which could serve as a reference for the Member States."
"That is why we will be supporting the proposal to reject the directive."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur on the work that has been done on this sensible and welcome proposal."
"We should bear in mind that it is a bathing waters directive, not a recreation directive, so we should not venture into the deeper waters of boating and deep sea diving: we should instead restore it to what it started off as – a bathing water directive."
"It is also right that we look at seasonal bathing and do not try to cover the whole year."
"We should look at places where bathing actually takes place and where that is so designated by a Member State."
"It is sensible to simplify the two key tests relating to public health – on gastro-enteritis and e-coli."
"It is important too that there be flexibility where temporary and atypical pollution takes place."
"That is an improvement that has come from the committee."
"We should also be careful to give proper attention to the cost/benefit analysis because some quite large sums of money are involved – the cost to my country would be EUR 8.8 billion, albeit over 25 years."
"We should bear in mind that public information is important if we are going to have public confidence, and the blue flag has gained that confidence: we should be careful not to damage it."
"I am pleased we have not gone for the multicoloured flags."
"I gather that we are now going to consult on smiling faces: if we end up with the happy, smiling face of Mrs Wällstrom looking down on Brighton beach, I am sure that will be a boon to mankind, but it must stand alongside the blue flag."
"Lastly, the question of radioactivity is perhaps not one for this measure, as one of the amendments suggests."
"There are, after all, rocks with natural radioactivity close to beaches and we do not want everyone to have to go swimming with a Geiger counter in their swimming trunks, or indeed swimming trunks that turn black if they meet any radioactivity!"
"I would like to concentrate on an important amendment which has been mentioned in this debate, namely Amendment No 19 on the conformity and control of transitory contamination."
"It is critical for me as a Scottish representative in the House."
"In south-west Scotland, the Irvine and Aire river valleys are particularly susceptible during times of heavy rainfall – in flash floods during the summer months, for example – to failing to meet the micro-biological standards for good quality during those few, rare days."
"This does not mean that beaches in Britain are hotbeds of pollution."
"It means we need flexibility in measuring and sampling to deal with these natural occurrences."
"Amendment No 19 introduces a two-part system of management action."
"Its purpose is to bring the Commission's proposal into line with the approach adopted in World Health Organisation guidelines for recreational use."
"The guidelines acknowledge that the tighter standards proposed by the WHO would be breached under some circumstances, i.e. heavy rainfall, and include an allowance to discount samples during these periods, provided that management measures are in place to protect bathers."
"The amendment encourages authorities to take preventive action where possible to protect bathers from exposure to pollution."
"The Council of European Municipalities and Regions has also backed Amendment No 19, and local government wants to see bathing water quality improve by introducing more flexibility into bathing water rules."
"Mr President, the Commission’s proposal contains some good features in the form of more stringent requirements concerning bacteria content, with a maximum of 500 Escherichia coli per 100 ml and 200 intestinal enterococci per 100 ml. The sampling frequency recommended by the Commission is not, however, sufficient and undercuts the current arrangements in Denmark."
"The bathing season is set at three months in Denmark."
"The Commission’s proposal would mean the number of samples we take each season falling from ten to two."
"In the quest for clean bathing water, it would clearly entail a reduction in safety."
"It is, however, with pleasure that I am able to observe that quite a few of the amendments tabled by the liberal rapporteur, Mr Maaten, disappeared in the course of discussion by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr Maaten’s jolly proposal concerning definitions of bathers and bathing water and a colourful range of star-spangled flags on the beach has fortunately disappeared."
"It saves Parliament from becoming still more of a laughing stock in the eyes of the public."
"The rapporteur’s report gave rise to 124 supplementary amendments by fellow MEPs in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but the many amendments to Mr Maaten’s proposal also show how a political group can waste a huge amount of MEPs’ time."
"I am unable to support the report’s proposal to include other leisure activities in the definition of the framework for the bathing water directive."
"– Mr President, it is clear that the increasing mobility of Europeans, tourism and, let us face it, bathing habits, mean that the beaches of Europe, the beaches of my country, Spain, which 50 years ago were half empty, have now filled up."
"Not only with tourists, either: the local people also bathe on their beaches, something they did not do 50 years ago."
"All of this means that the citizens of Europe aspire to having the same quality of bathing water, regardless of the country or location they are swimming in."
"I therefore believe that the Commission is right to propose – and of I believe it is extremely timely – this greater control of bathing waters, better information for users and also improvements in the quality of those waters in cases where it is advisable or necessary."
"The relationship between risks of various infections and water quality has been demonstrated beyond all doubt."
"If, therefore, by means of this directive we can contribute to reducing the risk of contracting infections or other types of illness, our efforts will have been worthwhile."
"Having said this, however, I believe that here also we must apply a cost-benefit analysis and not try to use a sledgehammer to crack nuts."
"In this regard, there are certain aspects of certain amendments to this directive which I believe to be entirely out of context and unnecessary."
"One of them is the issue of physical and chemical parameters: they are not important in terms of water quality; only microbiological parameters are important."
"The rest is an aesthetic issue, but not a health issue."
"Introducing these parameters would enormously complicate the application of the directive and, furthermore, would make the framework directive which already deals with these issues redundant."
"With regard to information, I believe it is absurd and unacceptable to indicate the specific languages in which the information must be provided."
"I believe that each Member State will indicate the language or languages appropriate for this purpose."
"Finally, on another issue which has been debated, in relation to parameters, I entirely agree with the use of those parameters indicated by the WHO and I fully support my group’s position."
"– Mr President, the proposal for the new bathing water directive that we are now discussing unfortunately has the same fundamental defect as the previous directive, namely a very vague definition of what is meant by bathing water."
"One consequence of this has so far been that the Commission has been able to come up with its own interpretation of the concept, ‘a large number of bathers’."
"It is thus unsatisfactory in terms of legal certainty for the new directive not to contain simple and clear information, either."
"It is also noteworthy that the directive does not take any account of the extremely varied conditions that apply in different Member States."
"In Sweden, we have, for example, 1932 miles of coast and 95 700 lakes with a surface area in excess of one hectare."
"Furthermore, we have the legal right of access to private land, which in principle means that everyone residing in our country has access to these bathing waters."
"Support for Amendment No 76 means yes to a simple, clear and, so too, legally certain definition."
"Nor should there be a negative effect upon Member States with basic conditions different from those in the countries of northern Europe."
"It should thus be possible to apply the directive throughout the EU."
". – Mr President, I should like to make some comments on the amendments tabled."
"First of all, I thank Members for their comments, which I read as support for the basic philosophy and structure of the proposal."
"Actually, both Parliament and Council also confirmed their support in negotiating the Sixth Environmental Action Programme in 2002."
"I also thank Members for not bringing into question the health standards which the Commission has proposed."
"The Commission cannot accept narrowing the scope of the directive via Amendments Nos 5 or 76."
"What counts is the importance of a bathing site for a local community."
"People in northern or non-tourist regions also have the right to bathe in safety."
"The Commission therefore disapproves of limiting the scope for bathers to one hundred per day and restricting the scope for watersports to one hundred metres."
"Although the Commission appreciates that many MEPs have attempted to improve the integration of the water framework and bathing water directives, the Commission cannot agree with all amendments concerned."
"Amendments Nos 3, 4, 16, 21 and 33 are unacceptable because they create redundancy between the two directives."
"Good chemical status is already covered by the water framework directive and we do not have to duplicate that."
"In some cases, waters can be of excellent quality for bathing without having a good ecological status."
"Nevertheless, the Commission accepts in principle Amendment No 32, which extends the bathing water profile by adding elements such as hydrological characteristics in relation to the water framework directive."
"However, it must be kept in mind that the scales of both directives are very different."
"The water framework directive applies to river basins, whereas the bathing water directive has a very local scope."
"The Commission believes that the basis of good bathing water management is found within a well documented and updated bathing water profile."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept amendments like 43 and 44, which reduce the knowledge and control of bathing waters."
"The Commission welcomes Amendments Nos 8, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20, 34, 35 and 36 concerning bathing water management, public participation and information to the public."
"However, the Commission would prefer to leave to subsidiarity the choice of symbols and logos depicting bathing water quality and therefore does not want to take on board Amendments Nos 21 and 27."
"On Amendment No 19, I would like to say the following: the Commission is open to a certain amount of flexibility on bathing waters which suffer from predictable and manageable short-term contamination."
"However, flexibility should not undermine the credibility of the directive."
"Bathing waters which suffer from occasional and short-term events should be identified as such to the public."
"It is also important for the evaluation of EU bathing sites that no bathing water remains in conformity if the pollution is neither properly identified or mastered."
"As regards Amendment No 19, the Commission rejects the levels proposed by paragraph 2, the unlimited exclusion of samples in paragraph 3(a) and the almost unconditional conformity as proposed in paragraph 5."
"I regret that some amendments aim to increase the risks people will face when bathing."
"Amendments Nos 62 and 66 both increase the risks of illness from 5% to 9%."
"The Commission is aware of the need to adapt legislation to technical and scientific progress and welcomes Amendments Nos 28, 29 and 30 on the revision and adaptation of the directive."
"In this context, the Commission has just launched a call for proposals under the Sixth Framework Programme calling for projects on virus detection techniques in bathing waters."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept, to a greater or to a lesser degree, 32 amendments of the 76 amendments tabled."
"I therefore look forward to the results of tomorrow's vote."
"I should like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Maaten."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0290/2003) by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision on a monitoring mechanism of Community greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol (COM(2003) 51 – C5-0031/2003 – 2003/0029(COD))."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, I address you today in the knowledge that a compromise package aimed at securing a first reading agreement is on the table."
"Accurate monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions is vital to give us an overview of how effective EU policies are in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and what more needs to be done to meet our Kyoto targets."
"This decision is an important further step in implementing the Kyoto Protocol and in ensuring that the Community delivers on all its commitments under the Protocol."
"Let me extend my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and his colleagues in the European Parliament, who have worked hard to enable a first reading agreement to be reached on this decision."
"Reaching agreement at first reading stage will enable this decision to enter into force quickly and be implemented by the Member States and would be a further concrete demonstration of the Community's commitment to addressing the problems of climate change."
"Finally, of course, I warmly encourage Members of the European Parliament to support this possible deal."
". Mr President, since 1992, the international community, or a substantial part of it, at least, has been reacting to and combating one of the greatest environmental and economic challenges facing mankind: climate change."
"As we know, it is the most significant global issue in the area of environmental sustainability and is having disastrous effects not only on the climate but on ecosystems and plant and animal species too."
"The Union took up the challenge in May 2002, with the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, thus demonstrating that the combating of climate change is one of its strategic priorities."
"In the decision ratifying the Protocol, the Member States agreed to fulfil their obligations under the Protocol jointly."
"In order to ensure that the Community as a whole succeeds in complying with the international legally binding commitments, they have agreed different emission reduction and limitation targets for each Member State."
"The Member States are therefore still responsible for reporting the data on annual emissions."
"The proposal for a decision on which we are about to vote therefore establishes the necessary framework for ensuring the Community and its Member States meet the requirements on emissions reporting and accounting through an improvement of the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures adopted and on emissions and removals of all greenhouse gases, including methodological aspects."
"Following the structure of the Kyoto Protocol and the United Nations Convention guidelines, different reporting requirements are to be addressed by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting obligations."
"In addition, there are two provisions that are central to compliance with the commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol."
"These are the implementation and the periodical update of national programmes for limiting or reducing gas emissions and the transparent monitoring of actual and projected emissions."
"Tomorrow’s vote will oblige the Member States to calculate and send the Commission data on actual and estimated gas emissions by 15 January each year, so that the actual progress made can be assessed and the Community can draw up annual reports in accordance with its international obligations."
"The few amendments your rapporteur has made to the proposed legislation are aimed at rendering the mechanism even more binding and effective, especially in the light of the latest, barely encouraging, data that show an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union for the second year running."
"As Mrs Wallström said, regarding the proposed amendments – 18, to be precise – in the informal negotiations which took place with the Council and the Commission after the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had given its opinion, an agreement was reached which incorporated the essence of our amendments, including the amendments with the greatest political significance such as those concerning the necessarily and mandatorily supplementary nature of the use of flexible mechanisms with regard to the internal action plans which each Member State is to introduce and pursue in order to achieve its own greenhouse gas emission reduction goals."
"Therefore, in tomorrow’s vote in the Chamber, we will be tabling a package of amendments on which agreement has been reached."
"I hope that Parliament will genuinely give fresh impetus to the measure, allowing the Member States to bring themselves into line with these rules quickly."
"I believe that it will also be a clear political signal with a view to a major event, next December in Milan, when we hope that more of the international community will ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, global warming is a phenomenon that we are all experiencing on a daily basis."
"The heatwave, which affected us severely this summer, is a reminder of how serious the problem of greenhouse gas emissions is."
"We urgently need to find sustainable solutions to this problem."
"Clearly the European Union has to comply with the Kyoto objectives and above all contribute to ensuring sustainable development for future generations."
"The proposal for a decision, to be put to the vote during this part-session, is an important piece in the European Union's regulatory jigsaw on greenhouse gas emissions."
"Apart from the environmental aspect, we have to bear in mind that governments and industry are the main players here."
"The text in question makes it possible to put in place an efficient and reliable emissions calculation and projection system, an essential precondition for producing an evaluation of the situation in Europe that can be passed up to international level."
"At present, the information is still incomplete or inaccurate."
"As far as current Member States are concerned, too much information is still lacking, mainly on carbon sinks."
"The combination of environmental concerns, economic interests and governmental reluctance makes this a complex task, but we have been relatively successful in this case."
"Nevertheless, I would draw Members' attention to a specific point, the flexibility prescribed by the Kyoto Protocol for determining the reference year for monitoring certain gases."
"We should distance ourselves from the Commission's proposal of 1990 as the sole reference year and stick to the Protocol, while waiting to see what amendments might be made, as has just been said."
"That apart, I would strongly encourage Members to vote in favour of this text, which provides a reasonable legal framework and an appropriate timetable, combining flexibility and efficacy."
"– Mr President, right at the start I wish to thank my colleague, Guido Sacconi, for his excellent levels of cooperation in drawing up the report we are discussing."
"The fact that we can hopefully conclude the debate on the directive at first reading shows that the European Union wants to work seriously to slow down climate change."
"There has been excellent cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and I believe Mr Sacconi’s personal input has been important in this."
"The Kyoto Protocol lays down the obligations of the Parties to report on emissions."
"The decision on reporting in the EU, which goes back 10 years, has been an important basis for allowing us to reliably verify any negative trend with regard to emissions and create a framework to reverse that trend."
"It does not, however, adequately meet the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol."
"In terms of accuracy and the way it is divided up, current reporting practice does not correspond, for example, to the way it should be divided up according to category of activity under the directive on emissions trading, which was adopted by the EU in the summer."
"Furthermore, there have been major omissions in the work of Member States and information that has either not been submitted or is inadequate has had to be supplemented by making the necessary calculations."
"With the text now to be adopted the quality and accuracy of reporting will improve significantly."
"At the same time the intention is to rationalise how frequently information is submitted by distinguishing between annual and periodical reporting."
"Under the so-called compromise package Parliament’s rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the Council have agreed between themselves that Member States must establish national inventory systems as soon as possible, and in any case no later than the end of 2005, for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by source."
"Compliance with the Kyoto agreements – both the setting of absolute targets and monitoring their achievement – obviously depends very much on how the inventory system is brought into operation."
"It is, of course, regrettable that there are not any guarantees of it being in operation when the first allocation with regard to emissions trading is made in the Member States."
"It will be important to adopt the grand total of 48 amendments contained in the compromise package in tomorrow’s vote so that the Member States can start to prepare for national implementation without delay."
"I wish in this connection to express one small hope."
"Under the Kyoto Protocol emissions in the first Kyoto commitment period will be examined on the basis of a five-year average."
"I would hope that the Community, for example the European Environment Agency, will also start to publish trends in emissions on the basis of a five-year average."
"That way we would eliminate, for example, differentials resulting from annual fluctuations in temperatures and rainfall when assessing how far the Community and the Member States are from the target."
"Present practice gives cause for unwarranted optimism and unwarranted pessimism, which can be hard to understand for the public at large."
"Mr President, we are absolutely obliged to take steps to propose to Parliament that a clear and effective mechanism be set up to monitor greenhouse gas emissions."
"I therefore fully support the compromise proposal to be brought forward tomorrow because it is important that we act with some urgency on this issue."
"It is a sad reality that, since we signed the Kyoto Protocol, gas emission levels in Europe have gone up instead of down."
"It is high time that we assumed our responsibilities."
"These responsibilities lie primarily with the Member States and it is time, as I said, that we assumed our responsibility not only for the health of our population today, but for the protection of our environment for tomorrow's generations as well."
"Last week's report indicated that three countries – Ireland, Spain and Italy – accounted for almost half of the five hundred infringements of environmental laws in the European Union over the last five years."
"This is an example of how Member States, having approved directives and transposed them, are failing to ensure that they are implemented."
"– Mr President, I should like, personally and on behalf of my group, to congratulate the rapporteur and those of my fellow Members who sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, who have managed to work together efficiently to table these compromise amendments with the aim of having this report adopted in one single reading."
"There is no doubt that the urgent procedure was appropriate faced with the dreadful scourge of greenhouse gases and their consequences in terms of disrupting the climate, not to mention their impact on ecosystems and biodiversity."
"Indeed we saw their deadly effects this summer during the month of August."
"I would also pay tribute to the Commission, which is proposing a more binding mechanism for implementing the commitments that we made in Kyoto in 1997."
"I might remind you that the Protocol, which was adopted the same year and ratified by the European Union in 2002, sets objectives in terms of emissions that the contracting parties must achieve by 2012: a reduction of 8%."
"The reference date for measuring this reduction still remains to be specified of course, without penalising those countries that made an earlier start on reducing emissions."
"Latest studies to date show that, unfortunately, total emissions have been on the increase since 2000 and, if we are to believe the forecasts of the European Environment Agency for 2001, overall emissions in the European Union of the six gases deemed to be responsible for climate change are up by 1% on the year 2000."
"This proves that we need to strengthen the legal monitoring instrument that was implemented in the European Union through a decision in 1993, and that is the purpose of the proposal being examined and debated today."
"It confirms that the Member States are responsible individually for the conditions under which they participate in the Kyoto mechanism."
"That is a good thing, provided that effective coordination and proper monitoring are guaranteed."
"My group obviously welcomes the new requirements for improving the quality and accuracy of the information provided on policies and measures, including on emissions and the absorption of all greenhouse gases, as well as on the aspects relating to methodology."
"My group also agrees with the rules stipulating how often this information needs to be provided and it also seems to me to be essential for the Commission to table a report to Parliament and the Council following its annual assessment of anticipated progress, measured on the basis of the estimated impact of policies and measures to reduce emissions."
"Following the rapporteur's example, my group therefore supports the request that the decision should become immediately effective."
"What we are actually requesting is for this exercise to be classified as a top priority."
"It is the future of our earth that is at stake and all of the measures taken in other existing and future texts need to comply with the framework and standards set out in Kyoto."
"Mr President, I welcome the proposal to choose 1990 as the reference year."
"It is important to recognise the tremendous efforts that have been made by France and Finland to reduce their emissions between 1990 and 1995."
"This proposal replaces the mechanism in operation since 1993 for monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating progress towards meeting commitments in respect of these emissions."
"These proposals reflect the reporting requirements of the Marrakesh Accords to the Kyoto Protocol, including the use of flexible mechanisms and registries."
"It is essential to ensure that more information is available concerning the emission levels from within the Member States of the Union."
"We all agree on the importance of complying with the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change."
"The earth's average surface temperature rose by around 0.06o Celsius during the 20th century."
"Evidence is getting stronger that most of the global warming over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."
"These activities relate to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which have caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases."
"We want to see all industrialised countries take urgent action to reduce or limit future greenhouse gas emissions."
"Temperature increases can trigger serious consequences, with coastal areas flooded and the lives of many people living in island communities under threat."
"The European Union is implementing the European Climate Change Programme, which will ensure that the Union achieves the 8% cut in emissions between 2008 and 2012, which is our political commitment under the Kyoto Protocol."
"I congratulate Mr Sacconi on his report."
"Mr President, let me start by acknowledging the contribution that my colleague, Mr Moreira Da Silva, has made to the emissions trading directive and all matters relating to Kyoto for so long."
"He has been called back to serve in the Portuguese Government."
"He will be missed, and particularly his expertise in that area."
"This evening we are dealing with a proposal for revising the monitoring mechanisms laid down in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the Kyoto Protocol."
"New rules are necessary for many reasons: scientific progress in the last decade, new elements such as carbon sinks, the transboundary nature of gas emissions and the obvious need for a Community approach and the harmonisation of rules in this area."
"In other words, as the European Environment Agency has told us, we need consistency and transparency in reporting on greenhouse gas emissions."
"From an Irish perspective, we view the proposal very positively."
"It is in our interest to have a structured system in place at EU level to assist in the development of our own domestic requirements."
"The proposal is also relevant for the assessment of national allocation plans under the proposed emissions trading directive, which is going through at the moment."
"We have some concerns in relation to deadlines."
"I hope that they are practical and achievable, as regards the various aspects in the proposal."
"If they are practical and realistic, then it will be possible to insist on delivery from all Member States, even those that have difficulties in reaching targets in this area."
"If they are not practical and people are agreeing to them, then we will be giving hostages to fortune in this regard."
"Ireland's situation as regards Kyoto targets is, to be honest, fairly dismal."
"Ireland was offered 1990 levels, plus 13%."
"The last time we looked, emissions were already at 1990 levels, plus 22%."
"I understand that the EU average is currently at about 1% over."
"Ireland has a lot to do in this particular area and anything that can help us to collect our minds and deliver – as we must as a nation – is to be welcomed."
"I welcome the proposal before us here today."
". – Mr President, when the European Community signed the Kyoto Protocol, we knew that this commitment would require solid action in future, and the recently adopted European Union emissions trading scheme is a centrepiece of that action."
"This decision is another key piece of that jigsaw; therefore, the Commission can wholly endorse this first reading agreement."
"Monitoring and reporting are of course crucial, and I can reassure Members of Parliament that I will also do everything in my power to make sure that we report to citizens on how Member States are doing."
"We naturally base our information very much on the work of the European Environment Agency."
"We will return to this matter, but our assessment is that this is a feasible and practical system."
"That is not to say it will be easy for Member States."
"That is certainly not the case, but we will have to live up to our commitments, and I ask Parliament to conclude tomorrow by voting through the amendments with a resolute majority."
"In this way, the European Union and the European Community will reaffirm their commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the commitment to put in place the necessary measures in the fight against problems of climate change."
"Everything we do to demonstrate that we want and are able to live up to our commitments will also send a signal to the rest of the world – and in particular to a certain country which we want to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as well."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the report (A5-0296/2003) by Bernd Lange, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery (COM(2002) 765 – C5-0636/2002 – 2002/0304(COD))."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for the quality of his work on this technically complex issue."
"This proposal is part of the Community's on-going efforts to reduce emissions to improve air quality in order to protect the environment and the health of our citizens."
"The objective of this proposal is to tighten emission standards for engines in non-road applications in the light of technological developments and the sector's contribution to emissions to air."
"The proposal also aims to extend the scope of the current Directive 97/68 to include engines in inland waterway vessels."
"Emissions from conventional on-road transport continue to be reduced; it is therefore right that, in parallel, further progress is made in the non-road sector, as technically and economically feasible solutions become available."
"At the same time, the Commission is conscious of the global nature of the market for engines covered by this directive and is aware of the benefits to industry of aligning developments with parallel regulatory proposals in the United States."
"I am very pleased with the progress that has been made on this proposal and applaud the important role that Parliament has played in moving towards an agreement at first reading."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the title of this report, which you, Mr President, have just read out, may be somewhat incomprehensible to the public."
"What, then, is this about?"
"This is about the exhaust emissions from construction machinery, excavators, locomotives and inland waterway vessels, and I believe that it is clear to many members of the public that we have to do something about them."
"On a building site on a street in a European city, the position is that the excavator and the bulldozer are allowed to disgorge far more emission into the atmosphere than the lorry that takes away the rubble, even though they are equipped with the same engine."
"It simply defies explanation that the same engine, at the same location, but installed in two different machines, is allowed to produce different levels of emissions."
"It is clear, then, that we have to do something about this."
"I am also very glad that it has been possible, even before first reading, to negotiate with the Council a compromise that was brought in jointly by the major political groups and with the support of many Members, with the ultimate objective of avoiding a conciliation procedure."
"This compromise goes some way towards what we decided in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We want to reduce the emissions from machines that are not road-going, and to do so in several stages."
"In so doing, we are in fact going down the same road as the United States, whose Environmental Protection Agency, as recently as April this year, submitted a proposal dealing with what is also our main concern – nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions – and indicating courses of action similar to the ones that we have discussed."
"This leads me to believe that this is the right way to go, as these machines are marketed around the world: several stages to reduce nitrogen oxides and particulates, with the result that, at the final stage, the incorporation of a particulate filter is an invariable requirement, enabling the substantial risk to health to be contained and the public, especially in urban agglomerations to be protected."
"We are also including railway locomotives in this directive."
"Some of you may well have seen, when standing on a station, the quantity of particulates that a diesel shunting engine discharges into the atmosphere as it goes back and forth."
"This, I believe, is another area where we need to act, but we are proceeding more cautiously than with the other machines, in that we have incorporated a review process in order to ensure that technological solutions remain feasible."
"The same applies to inland waterway vessels."
"I think this is an area in which we could have gone rather further, but there was no great momentum to do so – not because of technical considerations, but because of political considerations at Council level."
"We agreed to take care to ensure that engines cannot be electronically adjusted."
"We have seen how, as a result of electronic manipulation, the emission performance of some models of lorries in the United States was quite different under actual operating conditions to what it had been in the test cycle for type-approval."
"That possibility, too, will be excluded."
"We have agreed that performance once the test cycle is completed must not result in vastly greater emissions into the atmosphere, but that close attention must be paid to ensure that it remains within reasonable bounds in relation to the test cycle."
"I see us, today, as being able to take a significant step in the right direction."
"We have also ensured that manufacturers who complete the stages early can use that as a selling point."
"I believe that, ultimately, customers will see that as a crucial factor in their decision to buy, so that they can say, ‘here are engines that adhere to emission standards that are not yet in force – that could be the machine for me’, and bringing them onto the market at an early stage could represent a sales opportunity for the manufacturers."
"Overall, then, this is the right step to take and in the right direction."
"With it, we are following in the tradition of the many and varied pieces of legislation that we have adopted on cars, lorries, motorcycles, chain saws and lawnmowers."
"I believe that it can truly be said that we are writing another chapter in the success story of ‘Clean Air for Europe’."
"I thank all those who have helped in this."
". – Mr President, I warmly support the rapporteur."
"We in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, not being environmental scientists, have only examined the rationale underlying this report."
"Of key importance is, of course, the principle that the same standards must apply on and off the roads."
"With regard to non-road mobile machinery, we must draw our conclusions from experience gathered from cleaning engines in lorries."
"This report clearly indicates how the methods used can also be applied to other polluting engines in road machinery other than trucks."
"The share of emissions of non-mobile machinery has increased relatively speaking, precisely because of the success of engine cleaning techniques used in lorries."
"This is, in my view, an additional argument in favour of this adaptation."
"In a broader sense, though, this is also about the reputation of water and rail transport, of which it has always been claimed that they are cleaner than road transport."
"If that is the case, progress should also be made here, and cleaner diesel engines must be provided."
"The technology exists and is becoming available, and this is why the sector is given time to adjust."
"This must be done in such a way as to ensure that an incentive is given to the sector to accelerate the replacement process with diesel engines that are cleaner and that meet the prescribed conditions."
"Needless to say, harmonisation must also be examined at global level."
"This is about one market of a certain type of machinery, and that too has been given due consideration in the report."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism supports the purport of the rapporteur's proposals and we are, in principle, in favour of including in this report environmental standards for diesel machinery, that is to say diesel engines used in rail transport with a capacity in excess of 560 KW."
"In this respect, the rule that applies elsewhere should also apply here, namely that the sector is given a reasonable amount of time, coupled to technological development, to carry out the necessary innovations."
"In short, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I can say that Mr Lange's proposals are a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, I should first like to pay tribute to Mr Lange for all the work he has done on what is an extremely technically complex proposal."
"He has certainly gained a reputation in committee for having an extremely good technical understanding of the subject matters involved."
"Even if I do not necessarily agree with all the conclusions he reaches, I pay tribute to all the work he has done and for his understanding of the issues."
"I opposed many of the amendments that Mr Lange first proposed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I am happy to say that since then he has put in an enormous amount of work to negotiate compromises with the Council, the vast majority of which I am happy to endorse."
"I always believe that the approach we should take on environmental emissions directives must be proportionate."
"We must ensure that the environmental benefits are always balanced against the cost."
"So often in the EU we impose enormous costs on business and industry for sometimes relatively marginal improvements in environmental performance."
"Many of the compromises that have been negotiated I am happy now to support."
"The text is much more closely aligned with US EPO-proposed tier 4 limits and dates."
"The document now states that the proposed package of limit values should be aligned, as far as possible, with developments in the United States so as to offer manufacturers a global market for their engine concepts."
"That is an approach I strongly support."
"The text now puts back the review date to 2007, which gives much more opportunity for practical experience with after-treatment technology to be achieved before stages IIIB and IV are confirmed."
"Having said that, I will not support Amendments Nos 71, 75, 82 and 89, concerning replacement engines, the classification of auxiliary engines and engines used to perform maintenance or construction work."
"Because specific rail technology has not yet, in my view, been satisfactorily developed to meet the requirements of stages 3 and 4, I believe it is not possible to establish if and when these requirements can be met."
"I am happy with the vast majority of the compromises that Mr Lange has so skilfully negotiated and wish to pay tribute to the work he has done in that respect."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would also like to congratulate Mr Lange."
"Over the last few weeks, and literally single-handed, he has achieved – that was a pun! – quite incredible results with the Council."
"We now have a second reading agreement which we can all probably support."
"With one or two reservations, I think Mr Callanan will also be able to put his hand up for most things, so I think that we have a very good result."
"This is a very important step forward in controlling emissions in a sector not really yet touched."
"A whole range of non-road mobile machinery – construction equipment, barges and all sorts of niche equipment we have not yet though about – is going to be brought sensibly under control, putting an end to a lot of smelly diesel fume emissions in all sorts of strange places that prompt complaints."
"Sensible arrangements have been made for seasonal agricultural equipment and special equipment such as the diesel engines used to launch lifeboats in the UK, all of which have limited hours of operation every year."
"I think, quite frankly, that the ambitions of Parliament, as expressed by the Committee on the Environment, have exceeded the wishes of the Commission and the Council, particularly with regard to diesel engine trains."
"This is an area that we need to revisit at a future time and examine the particular circumstances that exist in the new Member States when they enter the Union."
"But we are now reaching a point where we can thoroughly support, by a large majority, the outcome of the rapporteur's work."
"I congratulate him on his efforts and hope that we will make future progress on the outstanding matters within an appropriate timescale."
"– Congratulations, Mr Lange."
"Five years ago, you needed three readings to achieve a sound result in the car oil programme."
"Now, and I am thereby briefly looking at Mr Bowe, agreement has been reached with the Council after first reading."
"That is first-rate!"
"Air pollution in the traditional sense of the word will soon be a thing of the past in Europe, at least once we have introduced the new engines in cars, lorries, in ordinary engines, chain saws and now also in pile drivers, freight trains and inland waterway vessels."
"The Commission did not want to introduce legislation, particularly for those trains and inland waterway vessels, until much later on."
"Parliament and the Council, though, refused to be thrown off balance and regulated this straight away, because it is technically possible."
"Freight trains and inland waterway vessels use much less energy, simply because resistance is much less significant."
"This means that the environmental benefit from freight trains and inland waterway vessels is completely back to what it used to be, something with which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted."
"– Mr President, Mr Lange, we are indeed heirs to a fine tradition in this area of European lawmaking."
"We have laid down rules for cars, motorbikes, ships, and motor-driven saws, and now it is the turn of non-road vehicles."
"This House is characterised by its continuity, in that you do not have to agree with every word, but every time, we have the same problem."
"The industry that builds the machine says, ‘We’ll sort it out’."
"Those who use the machines will of course say, ‘Oh God, we will need to use this for a long time before we can write the investment off.’"
"All this is understandable, and so I believe that the compromise at which we have arrived is the right one."
"It is in particular the fact that we are in step with the Americans that means we are on the right track when it comes to doing our bit to reduce distortions in competition."
"I am quite convinced that the reduction of emission values is more expensive in an area as industrialised as Europe than it is in other countries."
"Our problem is a simple one; there are more and more machines."
"They may be getting cleaner, but machines as a whole are becoming more numerous, and so we cannot take as rosy a view of our pollution of the environment with exhaust gases as we might wish."
"Although I am glad that we have found a way to accommodate the railways to some extent, a degree of harshness is still apparent, so there are two or three amendments with which I am not quite so happy."
"It is quite clear, though, that if people want, in the long term, to run these large motors – which are not 80 horse-power jobs, but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW, and have a correspondingly massive output – then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so; they must realise that they will have to do that in future, and they must make preparations."
"I believe that we are on the right track."
"If one thing or another remains to be sorted out, then our injured rapporteur will be able to handle that."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, this proposal sees us continuing a tradition of this House."
"We have, in the past, been very thorough in campaigning for a reduction in the emission of pollutants from motors, and now we want to deal with stationary apparatus and mobile machines, an area that has not hitherto been covered."
"Combating these pollutants, or actually reducing them, has no profound influence on potential pollution overall, but it is significant, in that these machines and pieces of apparatus are highly localised and are generally in use for a considerable period of time."
"This results in heavy local pollution, which is detrimental – particularly through particulates and nitrogen oxides – to people’s health."
"This is something we should constantly bear in mind."
"I can tell Mr Lange that we should be rather more cautious here, and that this is where we should not allow ourselves to be misled into presenting specific technical solutions as especially effective in reducing the emission of pollutants."
"Not only do we have to cut pollutants, but we also have to think about reducing CO2 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol."
"We know that installing filters increases the output of CO2."
"This, surely, is where a compromise has to be found, so that, while calling for a reduction, we nonetheless have to keep asking ourselves to what extent we have to approach this problem only from this direction."
"I can agree with the specification that the rapporteur has proposed, and we should continue to take this robust line."
"I can remember how, in 1998, it was prophesied that Europe’s oil sector would collapse; yet it ended up being quicker off the mark than the timescale we had proposed."
"Our approach is without doubt the right one."
"I am rather more cautious about extending this to railways and boats, where I am sure that there are still some open questions."
"We are attempting to move more goods on to rails and boats."
"We also know that public transport also has to be covered – a sector that makes particular use of rail vehicles."
"These, though, produce pollutants, and it is on these that we want to impose rules."
"We will have to re-examine this."
"That is why the proposal is right to include such vehicles; had it not done so, approving it would have been a bit more difficult."
"This way, we can agree on a common denominator."
". – Mr President, the proposed compromise is well balanced."
"It recognises the benefits to industry of regulatory alignment with parallel developments in the USA, and at the same time it is compatible with industry's capacity to respond."
"It also provides for a marked improvement in the environmental performance of engines in non-road applications."
"Importantly, it also includes a provision for a review in 2007 whereby the Commission will assess whether there is any need for adjustment to the Stage IIIb and Stage IV emissions standards and the timetable for their application or exemption."
"In addition, the proposed compromise addresses the issue of labelling and a number of technical issues such as 'cycle beating' and test cycle improvements."
"It also recognises that some details cannot be finalised at this point and are best left to comitology or the review."
"The Commission is very pleased with the outcome and again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for his efforts to reach an agreement at first reading."
"The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the Commission statement on the demolition of contaminated US warships in the European Union."
". – Mr President, the Commission has received a formal complaint from a Member of this Parliament against the UK, regarding the import of old warships into the United Kingdom."
"The Commission will, of course, write to the United Kingdom authorities as a matter of urgency to check whether there are any problems of compatibility with Community law."
"Let me assure Parliament at the outset that, as European Commissioner for the Environment, I simply do not believe that it makes sense to tow these contaminated ships across the Atlantic to the United Kingdom."
"Facilities for recycling them already exist in the United States of America."
"We are concerned by information from third parties that suggest that the ships may leak oil, PCBs and asbestos."
"Four ships have already left the United States and nine more are to follow."
"Two ships left two weeks ago and two ships left last week."
"An American court has issued a temporary restraining order regarding the nine remaining ships, and a final decision is awaited."
"I understand that the US authorities have voluntarily agreed not to send these remaining nine ships until March next year."
"If this is confirmed, I welcome the postponement, but I believe it should be more than just a postponement."
"All of the ships should remain in the US for environmentally sound dismantling, according to the proximity principle."
"More generally, and quite apart from this specific case, I am also concerned about the environmental and human health problems related to ship breaking, in particular the implications for non-OECD countries."
"Our estimate suggests that around 2 200 ships will be phased out altogether and scrapped as a result of the follow-up to the Prestige disaster and the phasing- out of single-hulled ships."
"We cannot dump this environmental problem on developing countries."
"Dismantling of ships is often undertaken under operating conditions that, from an environmental, health and safety perspective, cannot be considered sound."
"Unfortunately, it is the case that EU-owned and/or -flagged ships are also dismantled under such conditions."
"The parties to the Basel Convention, which deals with the control and management of hazardous waste including old ships, are meeting this week in Geneva to discuss this issue among others."
"I met with the secretariat of the Basel Convention this week to discuss the issue, and I am reassured that we will make progress there in addressing the issues before us."
"At a time when we are committed to developing an ambitious new European strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment, I do not believe that we should run the risks associated with transporting these ships across the Atlantic."
"In the light of the Erika and Prestige disasters, we need a precautionary approach to protecting this most fragile resource."
"In conclusion, I put to Parliament the question I put to the UK authorities last week."
"Would it not make more sense to send British expertise in the other direction, across the Atlantic?"
"– Commissioner, Mr President, this issue is obscured by a great deal of North Atlantic fog."
"If you ask the intelligence services about the current state of play, a whole load of questions are raised."
"Let me say at the outset that – unlike you, Commissioner – I am not fundamentally opposed to European shipyards, which are undergoing a major crisis, specialising in scrapping thousands of ships from throughout the world, and doing so under strict environmental constraints, a situation utterly different from that which currently – and lamentably – prevails in India, where the worst conceivable environmental dumping is going on and endangering people’s health to a substantial degree."
"We certainly do not want that."
"It naturally follows that we have a lot of questions to put to the British government, but, in its absence, I will use you as my mouthpiece and ask whether these are actually warships."
"The reason I ask this is that I have had widely divergent information."
"I am given to understand that warships can be scrapped only in the United States."
"Or are they vessels used for transport and commercial purposes?"
"How was the transaction conducted?"
"Did one government deal directly with the other, or were international middlemen involved?"
"What we need to know is why the work was not done in the United States."
"Moving ships across the North Atlantic costs money, of course, and there are enormous risks involved."
"Was it factored in to the calculations that one or other ship might sink?"
"That would have been a catastrophe of the sort that one would rather not talk about."
"Without wishing to tread on anyone’s toes, my second question is whether the country for which the ships were destined possesses the necessary infrastructures."
"Does it have the infrastructures for putting a ship in dry dock, and so on? These, Commissioner, are questions for you to answer; questions that you, as you have just mentioned, should concern yourself with."
"Is all this in accordance with the Basel Convention on the Export of Waste?"
"We know, of course, that the Americans did not sign it."
"These questions all call for serious scrutiny before we can come to a conclusion, but, all things considered, I would not want to exclude the possibility of Europeans offering such services to a very high environmental standard."
"Whether or not a ship is towed across the Atlantic, whether or not it is possible to do that – these are questions to be considered by the experts."
"Our approach to this topic should be highly critical, but very much in our interests as an industrialised continent, and we cannot of course accept it being confused with other matters."
"All this I have said in order to drop a hint, and I hope that the interpreters understand what I mean by that."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with Commissioner Wallström’s statement."
"My reasons for taking a decidedly sceptical view of the whole business have to do with considerations of environmental policy."
"As Commissioner Wallström said, this is where it is enormously important that the proximity principle should apply."
"Surely, I would think, a country such as the USA must be able to lay its hands on the know-how and the technology to dismantle old ships – whether they be warships or mercantile vessels."
"Mr Bowe is shaking his head, but I believe that a country that calls itself the best democracy in the world must be able to deal with its own problems."
"I would like you to tell me, Commissioner, whether this discussion included any reference to the possibility of involving the non-OECD countries, where there is, of course, a great danger of enormous damage to health and the environment."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle should also apply here."
"I would like to conclude by re-emphasising that I am very satisfied with your statement, and that I believe that the proximity principle must apply in such a serious case as this."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the campaign that we, together with a few members of our group, have launched will bear fruit."
"I am also very pleased with the statement that the Commissioner has made here, which has filled us with hope."
"I fear, however, that the steaming of the two ships to the United Kingdom is part of a bigger plan to set up a larger waste merry-go-round to countries such as India and Bangladesh."
"If these ships are allowed to cross the Atlantic, then this opens up the floodgates and sets a precedent."
"After that, it will be legally possible, against the spirit of the Basel Convention, to ship waste to countries that do not have a sound social or environmental policy."
"Over the past few years, all kinds of attempts have been made to prevent the export of waste and achieve a system whereby waste is processed as close to source as possible."
"Having ships cross the sea in this way is diametrically contrary to this."
"This is a very negative message from the United States, which has already put a few environmental treaties on ice."
"Surely that country has sufficient capacity and expertise at its disposal to scrap these ships itself."
"We should not point the finger only at the United States."
"It does, of course, have the cooperation of an EU Member State, which thus becomes, at the very least, an accessory to the enfeeblement of the Basel Convention."
"Moreover, that country has mapped out a course for these high-risk ships, as a result of which other Member States are put at risk."
"If we look for yet other accomplices, we end up once again with the International Maritime Organisation, which offers little in the way of cooperation when it comes to enforcing compliance with the Basel Convention."
"It is high time this changed."
"For this, the EU must adopt a united stance."
"Europe, too, exports old ships to the South for scrap, without their dangerous waste being processed first."
"A list is currently circulating of 144 ships that are ready for scrapping in the South."
"We are therefore relying on the Commission to create a legal framework as soon as possible in order to put a stop to this."
"We would thus ask for a maintenance policy for European end-of-life vessels."
"On 27 October, the Council of Environment Ministers will be holding a meeting."
"This is, therefore, a good opportunity to give a warning shot and take a legislative initiative."
"Mr President, I have a particular interest in this issue because I happen to be an inhabitant of a neighbouring island of the UK."
"It seems to me that the United Kingdom is acting in an extraordinarily irresponsible way in undertaking contracts to have ships of this kind brought across the Atlantic to be allegedly recycled in British ports."
"One has to ask what will happen to the hazardous waste that we are told makes up a significant proportion of these ships."
"We are led to believe that something like over 300 tonnes of PCBs and 600 tonnes of asbestos are contained in the four ships that are currently on their way to the United Kingdom."
"There are questions as to whether in fact the United Kingdom is in breach of EU regulations."
"The Commissioner has also already indicated that she has requested the UK authorities to indicate whether or not they believe they are still in compliance with EU laws."
"My understanding from the briefings I have received is that there is a requirement to have such ships dealt with within a period of 180 days."
"There is a requirement to have a dry dock basin available for the dismantling of these ships, but it is unlikely that they can be dealt with in 180 days and indeed there is no dry dock basin available for the recycling of these ships."
"There are very serious questions here, Commissioner, and I do not consider it sufficient for you to say simply that you have asked the UK authorities."
"When will they reply?"
"When will action be taken to protect the citizens of the UK, as well as the citizens of Ireland and elsewhere?"
"Finally, we are going to have arguments here about jobs in the UK."
"If we look back over history we have heard arguments that we could not abolish slavery or the sending of children up chimneys because we would lose jobs if we ended those practices."
"The environment is more important at this stage than a few hundred jobs."
"I would very much like to welcome Commissioner Wallström's comments."
"It is absolutely appalling that the United Kingdom is allowing itself to be a dumping ground for something that the United States did not want to deal with."
"The authorities there deemed these vessels to be too dangerous to break up in the US and it seems to me quite incredible that they would then be transported 4 500 miles across the Atlantic and through EU waters to be disposed of in the UK."
"Originally the plan was for the vessels to pass through Irish waters but at the moment it seems that is not the case."
"We are not sure whether we can be guaranteed that the routes will not change, but irrespective of that we have to look at our commitment, and the UK has to look at its commitment, to EU legislation – in particular the waste shipment regulation."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether the UK's action is in breach of Article 19(3) of the waste shipment regulation and Article 4 of the waste framework directive."
"In relation to Natura 2000, the Teesmouth and Cleveland coasts have been classified as special protection areas under that programme."
"This means, for the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna, that any plan or project not directly connected with, or necessary for the management of, the site, but which is likely to have a significant effect thereon – either individually or in combination with other plans or projects – shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications on the site."
"I would like to ask the Commission to investigate – or maybe it has already done this – whether the transportation and treatment of these ships is in breach of Natura 2000 legislation."
"What the UK is doing in relation not only to the UK coast but also in relation to the EU as a whole is completely unacceptable."
"We have just debated the bathing water directive and it is quite incredible to think that we are talking here about a Member State of the EU irresponsibly posing a major threat to our bathing waters and also to our fishing industry."
"What will happen, who will compensate people if there is an accident, if there is a disaster involving fisheries, tourism or any other issue?"
"This is actually about protecting jobs that already exist and about protecting our environment and indeed our fishing industry."
"I am very glad to see that the Commission is on our side on this, but it needs to put much more pressure on the British Government to behave in a responsible manner."
"Mr President, I have listened with complete amazement to some of the things that have been said here tonight."
"It is very difficult to work out whether there are any facts amongst all that fiction."
"There has been a complete cloud of confusion, and indeed a cloud of confusion that now has an odour of hypocrisy about it that I cannot believe."
"These are the facts."
"Those ships are dry cargo ships, they are not war vessels."
"Those ships do not contain any more toxic materials than any other normal cargo ship."
"The only asbestos on them is the asbestos you would find around any engine on any ship."
"The only oil on them is the oil you would find in the tanks that fuel them – they are not petrol tankers."
"They have very little in the way of PCBs and other hazardous substances."
"They have a seaworthiness certificate which was granted to them before they left harbour – and they would not have left harbour unless they had it."
"The States whose waters they pass through on the way have been consulted and their views taken into account."
"We are doing this properly and we are doing it because we decided ten years ago not to dump our oil rigs into the North Sea, but to bring them back to Teesside and other places and recycle them."
"We have the capacities."
"We have the knowledge."
"We have the capabilities to do what the Americans cannot do, because they dump their oil rigs into the Gulf of Mexico."
"The Commissioner should be asking what is going to happen to the 100 and more ships that are leaving EU waters this year to be dumped and destroyed in the Third World in a totally unacceptable manner, rather than making remarks about things being done properly by the British."
". – Mr Bowe, that was exactly the point I made!"
"I put this in the bigger context of the responsibility we have under the Basel Convention – we have to be able to fulfil the requirements of that Convention."
"This is part of the much bigger picture."
"You are right to point out the need for accurate information."
"That is why I have written to both the UK Government and authorities and also to the US, in order to gather the correct information."
"What I have been able to find out so far is that these 13 vessels are part of the national defence reserve fleet administered by the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD)."
"I also understand that all these ships were built between 1945 and 1967, so are between 36 and 58 years old."
"They are estimated to contain in total 698 tonnes of PCBs and more than 3 300 tonnes of fuel oil, as well as substantial amounts of lead, cadmium and asbestos."
"These ships are owned by the United States military administration and are no longer in operation."
"MARAD has reported many of the ships to be in a deteriorating condition."
"Eleven of the 13 ships figure on their priority list of the 40 ships in the worst condition."
"That is what I have been able to find out so far."
"Let us wait until we have all the information."
"In principle, I am not against the shipment of waste for the purpose of recycling."
"This is part of the existing legislation."
"But, at a time when we have fought so hard to clean up after the and accidents, along with other pollution accidents at sea, and when we are struggling to protect the marine environment, I do not see that this is the best way forward, when, apparently, there are recycling facilities in the United States."
"This is what I have asked for."
"We should make sure that this is an absolutely safe operation before we embark on it."
"Is this wise overall?"
"Is it common sense to do this, with the risks involved in towing these old ships – the oldest ships they have – containing so many dangerous substances?"
"Currently, we do not have a legal case against the United Kingdom."
"It is important to say that."
"We are looking at compliance with the existing directives that relate to Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and a number of other directives."
"Of course we will follow up the complaint we have received."
"I am responding as the Environment Commissioner."
"Is this the best thing we can do at a time when we are trying to protect our seas, waters and marine environment?"
"If we know that facilities exist, according to the proximity principle, in the United States, then why not send experts in the other direction."
"That seems less dangerous."
"As yet we do not have a legal case."
"We have asked for more information."
"But I cannot hide my own views on this particular issue."
"– Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0336/2003) by Mrs De Sarnez, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a programme for the enhancement of quality in higher education and the promotion of intercultural understanding through co-operation with third countries (Erasmus Mundus) (2004-2008) (8644/1/2003 – C5-0294/2003 – 2002/0165(COD))."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been working together for two years on the birth of Erasmus Mundus."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission, the Council and all of my fellow Members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the work that has been accomplished."
"By adopting the Erasmus Mundus programme for the period 2004-2008, the European Union will be creating a new instrument of exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education, with a view to forging links between European universities and creating a genuine European Higher Education Area, which alone will make it possible to attract students, teachers and researchers from across the world."
"I should like to remind you briefly of the main features of this programme."
"The first action consists of creating 250 European Masters Courses, known as 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', with the label and support of the European Union."
"These Masters Courses, which will be selected for a period of five years, will have to involve a minimum of three higher education institutions from three Member States."
"They will lead to the award of officially recognised dual or multiple diplomas."
"The students following these Masters Courses will have to pursue their studies in at least two of the three associated universities."
"The second action consists of creating Erasmus Mundus scholarships for 4 200 students coming to Europe from third countries."
"The value of these scholarships is significant."
"They are on a par with the scholarships granted under the Fulbright programme in the United States."
"These students will receive an average of EUR 1 600 per month to study on a postgraduate course within Erasmus Mundus."
"The third action focuses on teaching staff."
"One thousand lecturers or researchers from throughout the world will be able to visit European universities for teaching or research assignments of an average of three months."
"They will receive a bursary of EUR 13 000 for the assignment."
"The fourth action consists of developing partnerships between higher education institutions in third countries and European universities. These partnerships will be based on joint projects lasting a maximum of three years."
"They will focus mainly on the mobility of European students and teaching staff outside Europe."
"The fifth and final action is to promote European higher education on the world stage."
"To publicise Erasmus Mundus throughout the world, the European Union will make financial support available for international promotion campaigns and for the provision of services that make information available to third-country students, thus facilitating their access to European universities."
"Finally, I should like to stress the priorities that Parliament has championed, and which have been given a favourable hearing by the Council and the Commission."
"First priority: the name of the programme, initially entitled Erasmus World, has become Erasmus Mundus, making it easier for people to identify it with the European Union."
"Second priority: to preserve cultural and linguistic diversity, we have given students the opportunity to learn at least two of the languages spoken in the countries where their universities are situated."
"Third priority: we wanted the 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses' to be selected on the basis not only of the quality of the training proposed but also of the quality of the student hosting."
"Fourth priority: we also insisted that the diplomas and studies be officially recognised, as this is essential if we are finally to move towards a European Higher Education Area."
"We need to create real freedom of movement for diplomas within the European Union."
"This tour of Europe that we are offering students from third countries will thus also benefit European students in the future if they so wish."
"Fifth and final priority – the fifth priority that we in the European Parliament championed: we have agreed a budget that is equal to the programme's ambitions."
"The Education Council proposed allocating this programme EUR 180 million."
"The Commission was proposing EUR 200 million. In this second reading, Parliament has succeeded in obtaining a budget of EUR 230 million."
"I should like to reiterate here, Commissioner, how much I have appreciated the positive spirit in which we – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – have all worked together."
"I think that we can be pleased with the advances constituted by the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"I hope that Erasmus Mundus enjoys the same success and the same popularity as its little brother, Erasmus, and that it will thus enable the Europe of knowledge, to which we all aspire, to become a reality."
"– Mr President, may I first say that Mrs de Sarnez has done an excellent job."
"This is also – and I think that everyone would agree – an excellent initiative, which, I must confess, is among those that are closest to my heart."
"It seeks to make European higher education more attractive throughout the world and also here, in Europe; it seeks to enhance its quality, thanks to the European Masters’ courses, which will link several universities from different countries on our continent and which will be open to students and academics initially from here at home and later from the whole world, on the basis of the award of scholarships."
"We are at the second reading stage and I can tell you, Mrs de Sarnez, that the Commission can accept all seven of the amendments in the draft recommendation."
"In addition, I should like to congratulate Parliament and the Council on their efforts to reach a consensus – an important consensus, because it will enable us to accelerate the procedure and launch the programme as planned in 2004."
"As I have already said, the Commission fully endorses this consensus."
"It respects the substance of the proposal and it includes a budgetary allocation of EUR 230 million, which is worthy of a PHARE programme."
"This allocation is also in line with the budgetary programming prepared by the Commission with a view to enlargement."
"Amendment No 2 referring to the new generation of programmes; Amendments Nos 3 and 6 about the requirement of quality to be met by 'Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses', and Amendments Nos 4 and 7 on linguistic diversity, which is very dear to our hearts."
"I should like to say to Mrs de Sarnez and the Members of this House that wherever I go, in the Europe of Fifteen or in the new countries, and even outside Europe, everyone agrees that Erasmus Mundus is a magnificent initiative and everyone has high hopes of it."
"I am sure that it will contribute to greater convergence of our higher education systems and that it will have a major impact on how attractive they are to the rest of the world."
"Erasmus Mundus has the potential to become both a benchmark of European academic excellence and a vector for dialogue between peoples."
"I would like to thank Parliament very warmly for its cooperation from the very beginning to the very end of this process."
"I think that we have set up a marvellous programme."
"It will be up to the academics, students and teachers to really make it work."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, we have been in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport until now, where we voted on three very complicated reports."
"That is why I arrived so out of breath, but we did very well."
"I would like to thank Mrs de Sarnez for carrying out her work with such determination and so much drive."
"In doing so she achieved what we wanted to achieve; we will be able to start the Erasmus Mundus programme at the beginning of 2004."
"This report emphasises something that is very dear to Parliament, that is, we are creating a European learning area, an expression we were not allowed to use in relation to Socrates II."
"Today, I think everyone is talking in such terms and that, I believe, is a good thing."
"We are bringing Europe back onto the international stage."
"Europe will become more competitive and more attractive to young people from abroad."
"As against the EUR 180 million that the Commission wanted, we have set a figure of EUR 230 million."
"Achieving this increase took a great deal of effort, but I believe that it is also a reflection of the ambitions we have for this programme."
"To be genuinely appealing such a programme requires financing."
"We put further emphasis on language learning and that is a very important point because the students who come here study in three different countries and we expect them to try to learn at least two of the languages of these countries."
"I see Erasmus Mundus as a marvellous way of continuing Socrates-Erasmus, and I believe that we will make this programme a great success in 2004, the very year that the European elections are taking place."
"I hope that in so doing and in showing what we are capable of, we will make this a real attraction in the European Union and beyond."
"These students, coming from outside the EU, will be able to study in three places in Europe; they will assimilate the cultural diversity of the European Union, they will learn the languages and they will carry Europe’s message abroad."
"I am glad that we have come so far together on this road."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, often in this Parliament – and I will surprise no one by saying this – our debates are not terribly exciting and we address rather complex issues."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and having only just left a meeting of this same committee where we were voting without you, Mrs de Sarnez, I should like to say here that it was with widespread, indeed unanimous, enthusiasm that the Culture Committee worked on Mrs de Sarnez's excellent report."
"To be quite frank, when we saw the Commission document we thought the idea was excellent and we agreed that in some respects the Commission was almost being too cautious."
"Firstly, in respect of the budget. It is just as well that we were there to increase it a little."
"I might say straight away that this Parliament's Culture Committee does not consider the EUR 230 million to be sufficient and tends to think that it will have to be supplemented further."
"Moreover, if you think of the world today and the considerable number of large countries who, for reasons of international uncertainty, give the impression of being closed off, the fact that it is precisely under such conditions that Europe should choose to open up completely is of exceptional significance in our view."
"In the same way, we wanted to reinforce, consolidate and write in stone how valuable a degree such as the European Union Masters is."
"The Commission text tended to give the impression of any old studies leading to the award of a little certificate."
"We wanted to consolidate this qualification, this Master’s degree."
"In addition, Mr President, we thought it was very important to tighten up the wording on the learning of two foreign languages in this context."
"Where the Union's language policy is concerned, we have often protested in this Chamber about those governments who were not making it compulsory to learn two foreign languages in their countries. Some still do not do so."
"We will exert all the pressure we can in support of this policy and we are pleased to have found an opportunity to do so here."
"Finally, I should like to say that opening up European culture to students from throughout the world seems to me to be a wonderful initiative."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, we celebrated the enrolment of the one millionth Erasmus student."
"If it were up to me, we would offer yet many more students across the world the opportunity of studying at other universities."
"I am also indebted to Mrs de Sarnez for the energy she has put into the successful completion of her report."
"It is important in Europe to offer a sound alternative to the American universities, to which the majority of our European students go at present."
"As Europe seeks to become the world's most competitive knowledge economy, we ought to advertise ourselves as a centre of excellence, where academic standards are high, so that it makes it worth the effort for foreign students to come and study over here."
"For various reasons, I have always propagated that it is of major importance for students to learn foreign languages, at least two."
"This is a for anyone from the Netherlands."
"It also promotes the understanding of other cultures."
"I see this reflected in your report, which I welcome."
"The knowledge of languages does not only help the student with a university degree to secure a better competitive position within the labour market, it also contributes to his cultural baggage, and, lest we forget, to mutual understanding."
"I should nevertheless like to make an observation with regard to this report."
"The programme is intended for students and university lecturers from all over the world, hence the name 'Mundus'."
"I should, in this connection, like to press for extra attention for universities in developing countries."
"Education is the best weapon in the fight against poverty."
"By giving students from the developing countries the opportunity of acquiring learning within the EU, we can help them disseminate this knowledge in their own countries."
"However, I should like to add explicitly that it must, of course, be ensured that they plough their knowledge back into their own countries once they have completed their studies."
"The programme is not, after all, intended to crank up the brain drain."
"This requires sound cooperation among European universities and the universities from the developing countries, which must have the broadening of knowledge and experience of students and lecturers as a priority."
"– Mr President, I should like to present my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur for her excellent work."
"By covering postgraduate education, this Erasmus Mundus programme will be a very useful addition to the existing Erasmus programme, which, as you know, promotes respect and intercultural understanding as well as dialogue between our different peoples."
"The greater openness to the outside world that these Erasmus Mundus programmes bring is something quite remarkable and will make it possible to further enhance understanding between peoples."
"Yes, peoples: I did say peoples because I note that these days, unfortunately, it is the fashion to talk about citizens and to forget about peoples, as we see in the Convention's draft constitutional treaty."
"I belong to a people, the Catalan people, which does not necessarily coincide with the French and Spanish states, and I am pleased to recall here that the Erasmus Mundus programmes will foster mutual understanding between peoples, not only European peoples, but peoples from all over the world."
"Catalonia – since that is what I was talking about – hosts many students from throughout Europe."
"Barcelona is an attractive cultural centre and the fact that Catalan is not, regrettably, an official language astounds some students when they arrive there."
"They then discover that in Barcelona, Valencia, Palma or even in Perpignan, classes, or some of them, are taught in Catalan."
"In Barcelona, the majority of classes are taught in Catalan."
"You may have had the opportunity to see a very wise and very well-made film by Cédric Klapisch, which is the story of some Erasmus students and which also mentions this language problem."
"I think it is desirable for all European languages to enjoy equal rights, not only in these Erasmus Mundus programmes, but also in all of the European institutions."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, probably few topics are discussed in this Parliament on which there is consensus within this House."
"I hope that today's debate will prove an exception to this."
"Anyone who is concerned about the quality of education within the European Union, at whatever level, will be delighted that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement to start a programme whose only goal is to improve the quality of higher education in the Member States."
"In the past, only a chosen few were able to gain experience at foreign colleges of higher education or universities during their studies."
"That Europe is working towards offering more and more students this opportunity is a development about which we are all thrilled, no matter which political party we belong to."
"As a representative of Flanders, one of the smallest nations in the European Union, I often notice that our language, Dutch, is repeatedly under threat within our own universities, among others because an increasing number of courses, not only in Flanders, but also in the Netherlands, are being taught exclusively in English."
"I am therefore particularly pleased that the Council and Parliament, in their common position on the Erasmus Mundus programme, are asking special attention for the promotion of the knowledge of languages of students both within and outside of the European Union."
"By offering students in the Erasmus programme the opportunity to learn a minimum of two languages that are spoken in the countries where the colleges of higher education are based, we may be able, in time, to reverse the pernicious trend that we notice mainly in the large Member States."
"It is a sad fact that, over the past decades, European young people’s knowledge of languages, as well as of culture and history, has diminished."
"I am therefore stressing that it is not only students from third countries who should be encouraged to have a command of at least two EU languages."
"Our own young people of Europe too should urgently realise that a good command of various languages is the best guarantee that they will learn to appreciate other cultures."
"This is also the best way to maintain in future the rich diversity within the European Union."
"Accordingly, our universities and colleges, the entire higher education system, in fact, will remain a showcase to the rest of the world of which we have every reason to be proud."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the recommendation for second reading by Mrs De Sarnez, and the amendments unanimously tabled to it by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, are to be welcomed because they clarify and enhance various aspects of the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"The Education Council’s agreement that the financial envelope should be set at EUR 230 million is important, since that figure seems fairly satisfactory."
"Just as important is that this programme should open up new prospects in higher education, both within Europe and in terms of Europe’s collaborative relationships with third countries. Those relationships, moreover, should exist not only at student level, but also at the level of the non-European scholars invited."
"Finally, the care taken over linguistic matters and the principle of cultural diversity, the quality label and coordination between higher education and professional training, are also important."
"All of this becomes even more significant given the adoption of the measure making it possible for participants in the programme to travel round Europe attending several different universities. Furthermore, access to this same programme for European students has not been forgotten."
"Thinking in terms of enlargement, this agreement becomes even more meaningful, since from now on we have the opportunity to enhance the already impressive scope and size of the above-mentioned tour of Europe’s academic centres."
"It has now become necessary to devise a promotional campaign in order to allay the doubts and fears which, according to the media, have already arisen in certain academic circles."
"Some fundamental questions remain, however."
"Is this the way for the European education system to compete on truly equal terms with its United States counterpart, in either quantitative or qualitative terms?"
"Also, at European level, will a more even distribution of students among universities in the Member States be obtained?"
"Only time will tell us the answers to these questions."
"For now, it should be noted with approval that, in terms of higher education, Europe now has at its disposal yet another extremely useful international tool, which has raised the hopes of many, and justifiably so."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, it is encouraging that we are able to initiate two new educational programmes today, which, although they perform different functions and tasks, have a common goal, that is to say to make Europe more attractive and thereby to arouse greater interest in Europe across the world."
"The point has already been made that the programme, which generally applies to higher education institutions and students from across the world that have gained a first degree, must, however, also take account of vocational training, such as technical courses for engineers and higher technicians, which are included in the category of ‘higher education institutions’, and for which appropriate proposals are to be drawn up."
"Close cooperation between various European universities will make it possible to increase quality and increase international competitiveness."
"The compromise on the financial framework of EUR 230 million is just that – a compromise and no more – and I believe that this programme will only succeed in achieving its ambitious goal if all parties involved – the European Union, Member States and universities – accept these challenges and do their bit."
"EUR 230 million alone will certainly not suffice."
"Furthermore, it must be made clear that these financial resources must be raised in addition to other educational programmes and not redeployed from them."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Reding, I would like to congratulate Mrs de Sarnez on her excellent report and thank her once again for her cooperation."
"The Erasmus Mundus Programme can only be passionately supported."
"On the one hand, the programme’s added value consists in the possibility of mobility, in the learning of foreign languages as well as in intercultural exchanges."
"On the other hand, Erasmus Mundus accepts, in a pro-active and constructive way, the educational challenges of globalisation."
"It is precisely because the programme is open to students from third countries that Europe can distinguish itself further in the field of higher education."
"In an age of globalisation, there is competition for the best products, the best ideas and last but not least, for the best brains."
"It is for this reason that Europe must make itself more attractive and competitive as a place of study and education."
"As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the first reading of the report in April 2003, I too am particularly pleased today to see that Parliament has notched up one significant success."
"With EUR 230 million instead of the proposed EUR 180 million, Erasmus Mundus will have a sound financial basis."
"After all, what can sensible programmes achieve if they are not adequately funded?"
"What we have achieved is creditable, but the current commitments and the new initiatives are altogether inadequate when set against the Lisbon objectives."
"When money is tight and budgetary resources limited, we cannot expect to reach dizzy heights, but nor should money being tight and limited budgetary resources be excuses for preventing us from making farsighted political commitments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, education is the number one investment in the future."
"Do we want to have the most dynamic and most competitive economic area in the world by 2010?"
"If so, then we have to get our priorities right by investing in research and training, and Erasmus Mundus is a step in the right direction."
"– Mr President, I wish first of all to thank the rapporteur, Marielle de Sarnez, who has done excellent work with the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"We have achieved a result that is acceptable not only to Parliament but the Council too."
"For once we will have concluded a multi-annual programme’s legislative process before the programme is supposed to begin."
"Hopefully this exception will now become the rule for other programmes deliberated upon by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"The European Union at present is very obviously less attractive an option than the United States for higher education students from third countries."
"Each year the EU gets around 100 000 fewer new students than the United States."
"I believe that, in five years’ time, when Erasmus Mundus is well and truly under way, that figure will have decreased."
"The purpose of the programme is to improve the quality of European higher education by attracting more students and skills and know-how to Europe."
"We have to remember, however, that skills and know-how should not be lured here at the expense of third countries."
"Cooperation with universities in third countries is just as important, so that we can, for our part, strengthen the status of higher education in the countries participating in the programme."
"Seven months from now, the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union must be closely involved in the implementation of Erasmus Mundus right from the start."
"When the Union’s external borders change, it will be important for us to put to use the skills and know-how the future Member States already have from relations of cooperation with, for example, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"I believe the close involvement of the new Member States in this programme will also contribute to their participation in the implementation of other objectives with respect to the EU’s education policy."
"I am pleased with the result we achieved with regard to the programme’s linguistic issues."
"Fostering linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental values of the EU, but the aim of the Erasmus Mundus programme is obviously not the teaching of languages."
"Its purpose is to make European higher education look more attractive, and I therefore welcome the formulation we arrived at."
"– Mr President, Erasmus Mundus will significantly improve the quality of higher education in Europe: 250 European university courses, more than 4 000 scholarships for post-graduate students, 1 000 visiting professors from third countries, 4 000 students, 800 university scholars by 2008, partnerships between universities in third countries and Erasmus-Mundus universities in Europe – these are all important elements in boosting Europe as a place of knowledge and – as Mrs Pack said – in creating a European learning area."
"The financial perspectives do not seem quite so impressive; in the first reading we made it clear that EUR 200 million was not enough, we called for EUR 300 million."
"I agree with other Members that the Council’s proposal of EUR 180 million is completely unacceptable."
"Increasing the funding does not, by any means, put a burden on existing programmes."
"Mrs de Sarnez’s proposed compromise of EUR 230 million is sensible and it is in accordance with the new Interinstitutional Agreement."
"I think the excellent Commissioner Reding is certain to vote in favour of these perspectives."
"What is the point of a highly ambitious Lisbon objective if we do not have plenty of specific measures?"
"In Germany, we have learned from experience – and the Pisa study has made it very clear – that these do not come free of charge."
"What is the point of it when we are not investing enough in education in our ?"
"We will then be clearly lagging behind."
"It is the European Union that must award the ‘Erasmus-Mundus Masters Courses’ quality mark, so that we can then clearly identify a particular higher education, with good proficiency in the languages of at least two Member States."
"We have left a clear political mark both in terms of courses and in hosting students."
"There is one more thing that I feel is important. Vocational training – such as for engineers or higher technicians – must be integrated in such a way that we achieve uniformity in higher education too."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner and Mrs de Sarnez on this ambitious programme, on this big, substantial step."
"Opening the Europe of education at international level, which is a daring move, promotes the European learning area and we are now starting to look at it not in a fragmentary manner, but with the bridges which it has, with the cooperation which it has, as a real area."
"I think that the Erasmus Mundus programme is of a different quality in comparison with all the previous programmes, precisely because it is not based simply on exchanges, on mobility; on the contrary, it gives us a new stamp, a new reference point, to which the thousands of students and the hundreds of education institutions using it will be able to give real meaning."
"It is very important that Europe has the courage today to open up to competition, to languages and to cross-cultural understanding."
"We reward both the institutions and cooperation between them under this programme, as well as promoting the excellence of the students from whichever country, continent or cultural background they come."
"That means we are promoting European values."
"I think that we owe it to them."
"More importantly, we have to give something back to the countries from which the millions of economic migrants come and I think that what we are giving, these grants we are giving, are recompense and I trust that the majority of students will come to us from these developing countries."
"European students, inoculated from cooperation with foreigners, have a great deal to gain and a great deal to understand from the culture which they will bring to us."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0314/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council adopting a multi-annual programme (2004-2006) for the effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (Learning Programme) (8642/1/2003 – C5-0293/2003 – 2002/0303(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Mauro)."
". Mr President, with today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote, the Learning programme is officially coming into being."
"The time has come to congratulate those responsible for this achievement."
"The mother of the programme is, without a doubt, the European Commission, which launched the first Learning pilot action with its May 2000 communication, although, at that time, the action was not financed by its own budget line."
"Tomorrow, two years on, thanks to meticulous work characterised by cooperation between the institutions, the first multiannual Learning programme will be put to the vote."
"It is not, therefore, difficult to understand that the measure had a father too, as well as a mother."
"It is always more difficult to identify the father, and a question mark remains in this case too, but I would say that the role belongs equally to Parliament and the Council."
"The endeavours of the Council, both under the Greek Presidency and, more conclusively, under the Italian Presidency, enabled Parliament to find a substantial opening for its requests and, therefore, to allocate to the Learning programme sufficient funds for it to be launched."
"This multiannual programme, which stands alongside other historic programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo, meets the demands of the Lisbon, Stockholm and Barcelona European Councils."
"The main objectives are fighting the digital divide through implementing computer literacy methods, promoting virtual campuses, -twinning of schools, promoting and disseminating good practice and cooperation between Community programmes and action instruments promoted at national level."
"The programme’s budget was, as I said, increased to EUR 44 million thanks to what I would like to call close cooperation between the institutions."
"As regards the -twinning of European schools, in line with the objectives adopted in the previous European Parliament resolution, I wanted to stress once again how teacher training remains a priority."
"I would like us to reflect once again on the fact that, in 2003, on average, 90% of primary schools, 98% of secondary schools and 99% of vocational and technical schools in the Member States were connected to the Internet, but only 39% of primary school teachers, 50% of secondary school teachers and 58% of teachers in vocational and technical schools actually used the Internet as a teaching tool."
"There is, therefore, a great need for this programme."
"In actual fact, these averages conceal huge discrepancies between the Member States: while the average figure for Denmark is approximately 70%, the average figure for Greece is below 9%."
"From these figures, which are already, in themselves, quite clear, two things can be inferred."
"The first concerns the use of the Internet as a tool to facilitate teaching."
"It is not just a question of availability of infrastructure and school equipment but of teacher training, mentality and school organisation."
"The second concerns the use of technological resources."
"The setting up of virtual training rooms, for example, is one way of achieving the goal of exchanges of good practice between teachers in the different Member States, at both methodological and teaching level."
"For these reasons, I have attempted to stress in the report that theLearning programme should attach greater importance to finding more effective methods that will help teachers incorporate the use of the Internet into their teaching and encourage the dissemination of good practice in this sector."
"Once again, I would like to thank the Commission and all the Commission staff who have contributed to the success of our work."
"– Mr President, I should like first of all to thank Parliament for having made the Learning programme possible, because this programme relies on the results of preparatory and exploratory measures in favour of online training – Learning – that Parliament has voted for ever since 2001."
"Parliament's active support will therefore enable us to adopt this programme in record time, less than a year after the Commission tabled its proposal in December 2002."
"It is also your rapporteur, whom I should like to thank, who has made it possible to respect this very tight deadline."
"Mr Mauro has spared no effort and has done an excellent job."
"For example, thanks to him, teacher training has become one of the main objectives of the programme."
"In fact, we are aware that this training is one of the keys to the programme's success and that all of the Member States are already working on it."
"I am grateful to him for enriching the programme in this way."
"Today, then, we need to reach a decision with a view to the second reading, and I am sure that Parliament will be able to agree."
"The Council agrees with the content, including with the addition of teacher training."
"But, as you know, its position on the programme's budget, as set out in its common position, which was adopted by qualified majority, was initially very different from Parliament's."
"An agreement has now been reached."
"There is no doubt that we would have preferred a higher amount than that proposed by Parliament, but this has proved to be impossible."
"The EUR 44 million on which your institution must vote is therefore a compromise, but a compromise that will make it possible to complete the procedure, saving time and resources, and to launch the programme as planned on 1 January."
"I believe that, on this simple basis, we should tell ourselves that it is better to have a little less money and be able to start implementing a good programme straight away."
"Mr President, Commissioner Reding, training and education will be a major issue in the Council, the Commission and in this House, and I believe that, if we want to do justice to the -Learning programme, in order to bridge the digital divide between individual countries, regions and generations, then this report has certainly taken a step in the right direction."
"All European education and training systems must accelerate access to and use of new information and communication technologies to improve quality and reduce discrepancies."
"Once again I would like to mention the Bologna and Barcelona objectives, which, as you have already heard, could, if implemented, give the European economic area and learning area a chance."
"I am sorry to say that the situation in many countries – Austria included – is currently such that cost cutting has prevented increased investment in education that had been agreed, resulting instead in an increase in cutbacks in the education sector."
"Regrettably, we are moving further and further from the objective of becoming the most knowledge-based society in the world by 2013, as the Council has already indicated and predicted that it will still take a long time."
"When new programmes are initiated, they should also be implemented with the necessary determination, which means that they should – as the -Learning programme actually does – show visible signs of success after three years."
"I think that it is for the European Union to give a visible impulse in this area, thus starting a chain reaction and again making education a top priority in the Member States, so that it does not fall victim to the cost-cutting that has been the case to date."
"– Mr President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"A dynamic knowledge economy requires a sound Learning programme."
"I should like to make three observations."
"First of all, I think it positive that primary education is also involved in the programme, but the target group should also include people other than young people, for we must not neglect the elderly, or, for that matter, those who live in remote areas."
"It is precisely those people that we need to take out of their Learning isolation."
"Via lifelong learning, they benefit from this programme and they can pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generations."
"Grandmothers can chat online with their grandchildren – I am an expert at it."
"Secondly, there is virtual twinning of schools."
"There are large discrepancies between the different areas in Europe in terms of the use of information technology in education, and we must ensure that disadvantaged schools are given the incentive to dare take the plunge to Learning."
"Exchanging information and best practices via the Internet platform is of key importance."
"This is how schools will be able to benefit and learn from each other’s expertise."
"Thirdly, the candidate countries must also explicitly be involved in the programme."
"From experience, I know that there are schools that are already far advanced in the application of ICT in their education."
"The Join Multimedia programme run by Siemens is a case in point."
"I sit on its jury, and it is also appropriate, Commissioner, that this is linked to a European prize."
"I have attended the prize-giving ceremony and I was deeply impressed with what was on offer, to which this prize gives a boost."
"Finally, not only is the quantity important, but the quality should also be superior."
"I hope that the private sector that has been established, with the Learning Industry Group, can make an important contribution to this."
"Cooperation between the private and public sector is a necessary step towards a European dynamic knowledge economy, which is, after all, our aim."
"Mr President, I too would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur on his speed and efficiency with regard to this programme and also to thank the Commissioner for her initiative in recognising the opportunities offered by information technology."
"I think the two more important points, as mentioned by the Commissioner herself in her address, are, firstly, the question of finance: it is vital for any programme that it be properly budgeted for and given the resources to ensure that all can benefit from it."
"Secondly, I think the whole question of school-twinning is important, utilising best practices to bring up areas that have fallen behind and guaranteeing that the digital divide does not get any wider, because we now have the new illiterate, who are people of a certain age group – and I do not want to be ageist when I say this – who have a fear of technology and a phobia with regard to the use of it, and who risk being left behind because of a lack of access."
"In so many ways we see our education systems as older people passing information and knowledge onto younger people."
"Yet this is the one area where young people could actually be the teachers for older generations, giving them the skills and resources they require to utilise fully the opportunities afforded by this brave new world created by information technology."
"Obviously, the new job opportunities that are going to be created in the future will be based very much on technology."
"It is quite interesting when you look at the figures, which show that 70% of the workforce that will be employed in the year 2010 is already at work, but only 20% of the technology which will be used in that year is available at the present time."
"It is also quite interesting when looked at in another way: of all the scientists and inventors that have ever existed, 92% are living today."
"So the rate of change and the types of change which will take place in the future will be even greater and more vast and our capacity as human beings to cope with that change will be determined by the skills, knowledge and training that we are given in the interim period."
"– Mr President, the Union’s earlier education programmes are success stories because they are programmes on a human scale."
"The e-Learning programme now under discussion will hopefully extend that series of success stories."
"The general aim of the programme is to improve the quality and accessibility of education and training systems by means of information and communication technologies."
"I hope that teachers and learners will have a major role to play in achieving this aim."
"If we succeed in this we will also be more likely to realise the programme’s aims."
"The e-Learning programme is a good example of how pilot projects can claim a place in European Union policy."
"Back in 2001 the European Parliament began to support the initiative to promote e-learning and now we hold in our hands a proposal for a five-year action programme."
"Although we have not managed to increase the programme’s budget to the level we wanted exactly, the rapporteur, Mario Mauro, can be very pleased with the work he has done."
"The main focus of the e-Learning programme will be the e-twinning of schools."
"If networking between twinned schools truly gets under way, schoolchildren in different parts of the EU can get to know other pupils of the same age and learn about their everyday lives."
"If it is successful in this way, the programme could reinforce the idea of EU citizenship."
"E-learning offers new pedagogical models for teaching and learning."
"According to a study by the European Schoolnet, the development of interschool learning environments is flourishing in Europe."
"Commercial learning environments are used by just one in three users of virtual education."
"It is very important that these individual endeavours are made visible and available for others to make use of."
"The e-Learning programme does not give direct support to this, but hopefully in future we can also invest in the development of content."
"– Mr President, the use of ICT increases productivity, changes the way we work, creates the possibility of community in a new way, facilitates study, raises quality and largely eliminates geographical differences."
"The problem, however, is the digital divide, which probably affects about one third of our population."
"Education and training do not reach them, and they do not have computers."
"For that reason, I propose, Commissioner, that funds be made available, as directly as is possible, for organisations devoted to caring for the disabled, unemployed, poor and elderly, which can maintain levels of education and training within their own circles, as education and training do not extend to these sorts of people either."
"In this way they will also be able to purchase and build up a stock of equipment, because the digital gap is, of course, in practice an even wider form of social gap."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m."
"– The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0319/2003) by Mrs Hermange, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council decision authorising the Member States to ratify, or accede to, in the interest of the European Community, the Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (the 1996 Hague Convention) (COM(2003) 348 – C5-0302/2003 – 2003/0127(CNS))."
". – Mr President, this proposal aims to authorise Member States to ratify the 1996 Hague Convention on child protection in the interest of the European Community."
"It is a follow-up decision to the decision of 19 December 2002 which, exceptionally, allowed Member States to sign this Convention in the interest of the Community."
"The current proposal concerns the second and final stage of this procedure, that is, the ratification procedure."
"The scope of the Convention, which was concluded in 1996 within the framework of the Hague Conference on private international law, is very similar to that of the Council regulation on parental responsibility, which was approved by the Council on 3 October and will apply between Member States as of 1 March 2005."
"The new regulation creates a common judicial area in the field of divorce and parental responsibility."
"It contains specific provisions to facilitate cross-border visiting rights and to deter child abduction within the Community."
"It is widely recognised that the Convention would make a valuable contribution to the protection of children in situations that transcend the boundaries of the Community, thus usefully complementing the regulation on parental responsibility."
"The similarity between the two instruments will facilitate the parallel application of the two instruments that share the aim of offering increased protection to children who are resident within the Community or third states respectively."
"The Commission would like to express its gratitude to Parliament in general, and to the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, in particular, not only for their continued support of the Commission's work in the field of parental responsibility, but also for their enormous efforts in this particular case."
"The Commission is aware that Parliament has done everything in its power to speed up the procedure, including changing the date for the plenary vote from December, as originally scheduled, to today."
"The work of the rapporteur and the responsible committee has thus taken place under considerable time pressure."
"The Commission takes note favourably of the amendments proposed and is extremely grateful for these efforts which will enable the Council to adopt this proposal in early November, at the same time as the regulation on parental responsibility, thus ensuring parallelism between the two instruments."
"– Mr President, Europe has a duty to continually step up its efforts to establish a harmonised judicial area, in particular for the benefit of the weakest members of society."
"It is against this background that today's debate on parental responsibility is taking place."
"Parliament was consulted on this proposal for a Council decision at very short notice – as you reminded us, Commissioner – but the importance of the debate and the issues involved meant that it was willing to comply."
"I believe that we cannot do other than welcome this proposal, because this debate on parental responsibility is the consequence, dare I say it, of the political determination of a number of Members of this Parliament – foremost among them my colleague Mrs Banotti – who have been campaigning since 1994 for Parliament to take into account the child's best interests and the rights of the child."
"Although the Hague Convention of 1996 is a traditional legal instrument within private international law, it has already been a significant source of inspiration for those drafting the new regulation on parental responsibility."
"We already know that on 3 October, the Ministers of Justice of our respective countries adopted this new regulation, which should make it possible to avoid those interminable legal battles that are so detrimental to children."
"This new text also extends the scope of Brussels II to all decisions relating to child custody, which should be welcomed given that in many countries, in particular France and Germany, divorces and separations between couples from two different countries are still giving rise to substantial conflict."
"It will also mean that one single text will determine the judge competent to rule on a divorce or on issues affecting children."
"It is therefore a step in the right direction."
"Nevertheless, we should not forget that the thorny issue of parental responsibility also arises outside the European Union with regard to third countries."
"That is also why, in the same spirit, I support the Commission's proposal to authorise the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention."
"I am convinced that this Convention can make a valuable contribution to strengthening Community legislation on child protection in cases that go beyond the borders of the European Community."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that the overlap between the scopes of the Convention and the new regulation will, I am sure, make it easier to apply these two instruments in parallel."
"As you will have seen, given the rather procedural nature of the Commission's proposal, I have not tabled many amendments."
"I do not think that Parliament has had cause to object to the content of the proposal."
"It is an exceptional procedure, as I have underlined in my report, given that the Hague Convention stipulates that only sovereign states can be parties to it."
"This illustrates the importance of Parliament's role, because a parliamentary opinion is required for the Member States to accede to the Hague Convention."
"Commissioner, I have stressed the timetable."
"The Commission had proposed a very long deadline: 1 March 2005."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment proposing to bring this date forward by six months, to 30 June 2004."
"I do not think that you will have anything against this, particularly given that it is in the interests of the children."
"I have also tabled two further amendments, one of which refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the other to the work of the European Convention."
"You will be aware that in the first part of the draft constitution, Articles 3 and 4 provide that the Union shall combat exclusion and discrimination and provide social justice and protection, equality between women and men, solidarity between generations and protection of children's rights."
"It is in this spirit that I have proposed this amendment."
"Commissioner, we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture, because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that the rules are properly applied, but, given that it is up to the Member States, who remain sovereign in this field, to do this, the European Parliament will always have to ensure that, in accordance with the recent conclusions of the UN World Summit for Children, the child's best interests remain a prime concern, not only in all judicial decisions relating to children, but also in all of the decisions made by our Parliament."
"Mr President, Mrs Hermange is absolutely right."
"She was right to emphasise in the context of her excellent report that at the heart of all of this must be the best interests of children."
"As Parliament's mediator in these areas I receive many phone calls."
"I have spoken to some very distressed people representing parents whose children have been taken away."
"They tell me of a lack of access to these children and difficulties in getting the children back once they have been on access visits in another country."
"The great value of this particular piece of legislation is that we hope that many countries that, due to their own judicial systems, were unwilling to sign the Hague Convention of 1980 on the transnational abduction of children, will see their way to signing this piece of legislation, thus ensuring the safe and quick return of children who have been abducted."
"The good news is that Morocco has recently become the first Islamic country to sign this particular piece of international legislation, for which I would like to congratulate that country. We hope this will set a precedent for many of the other Islamic countries who do not feel, due to the type of legislation they have – Sharia law – that they can sign the 1980 Convention."
"The good news also is that very recently the Council passed the Brussels II Convention."
"Even though the rights of children are not enshrined in the Treaty yet – and we hope this will come eventually – we now have several pieces of excellent legislation that should ensure the safety and rights of these children to know both their parents in the event of a marital breakdown."
"The fact is that under the Brussels II Convention the decisions made in the court in the country where the child normally lives can be implemented in the country where the abducted child is being held."
"The 1996 Hague Convention is an excellent piece of legislation."
"I can assure you, Mr President, Mrs Reding and Mrs Hermange, that they will be raising glasses of champagne to us tonight in The Hague."
"They have been most anxious to see this matter progress."
"The Secretary-General of the Hague Convention, Mr Duncan, will be absolutely delighted at the speed, efficiency and care with which Mrs Hermange has brought her report to us."
"– Mr President, Mrs Hermange’s report is in fact a very important one."
"Recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children are of such great value that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote unreservedly in favour of all of the amendments and Mrs Hermange’s report."
"We will do this because we know how important the protection of children is."
"As you know, I am a member of a Franco-German mediation group, and know what difficulties and sad cases we have to deal with in it."
"It is the children themselves who suffer."
"We will vote in favour, although as a Member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and as a rapporteur, or a designated rapporteur for this Committee – we could not draw up another report because there was not enough time to do so – I would like to make a few remarks."
"In fact, I would like to mention three questions, which I forwarded to the Commission through Mr Gargani, the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and also a question that Mrs Hermange asked, which referred to the importance of this agreement in connection with Community law."
"We have Brussels II, we have drawn up legislation for the European Union, and our input into this legislation is, in my view, highly creditable."
"Yet, at the same time, the Commission allowed this agreement to be discussed and certain things to be deliberated on without informing Parliament or giving it the chance to be involved."
"That poses an important institutional question as to what the connection is between the agreement and the European legislative procedure, and what Parliament’s rights are on this matter."
"The upshot is that we agree with this exception, because we see this agreement as exceptionally important and we do not want children to be punished in any way just because it there a potential interinstitutional conflict."
"We will, however, raise this question again in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, since it cannot be acceptable for Parliament’s rights to be annulled due to parallel legislation at European and International level."
"That would not be in the least bit sensible."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere thanks and congratulations go to Mrs Hermange for an excellent report."
"It is extremely important that the Hague Convention on parental responsibility and the protection of children, which dates back to 1996, is ratified by the rest of the Member States as quickly as possible."
"The Hague Convention and, in particular, the Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, which was adopted at the beginning of the month by the Member States of the European Union, will be a considerable help in settling disputes on custody within Europe."
"In Europe we have actually acquired an instrument to help us to reach swift and effective decisions in disputes over custody and enable us to avoid long, expensive and difficult legal proceedings with regard to separations across borders, which are so painful for children."
"We can really ensure that children grow up in a calm environment."
"I am glad and a little surprised to see just how excellent a reception the Regulation has had throughout Europe."
"Both the press and children’s organisations have together commended us on what we have achieved."
"Divorce is always a traumatic experience for a child, as it is for adults too, and if it is followed by litigation that lasts for years it can become absolutely intolerable."
"With this Regulation the EU will have, for the first time, an instrument by means of which conflicts arising from different laws in different Member States can be avoided."
"Of course we cannot meddle with the content of the Hague Convention in this report by Mrs Hermange."
"For that reason, I wish to ask whether the Commission and the Council are aware that the biggest problems are in any case disputes over the custody and the abduction of children when one of the parents comes from outside the EU and a country that has not ratified the Hague Convention."
"We have all read sad stories in the tabloid press about children being abducted, a harrowing experience for parents and the playmates of the children involved."
"Could the European Union itself have a hand in promoting the ratification of the Hague Convention?"
"Could the Commission and the Council try to negotiate more bilateral agreements so that the Hague Convention might be signed in still more countries?"
"We would achieve even better results if we could involve countries outside the EU in this same arrangement that now allows us to deal with custody disputes within the Union."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow from 11.30 a.m."
"(1)"
"We now come to the decision on urgent procedure:"
"Proposal for a Council Decision on additional macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro amending Decision 2002/882/EC providing financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2003) 506 – C5-0428/2003 – 2003/0190(CNS)]"
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has already adopted a report by Mr Belder on this subject."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in June 2003 Parliament adopted, by a large majority, a report by Mr Belder, in which we called for there to be no more ad hoc Parliament approval on urgent macro-financial assistance and for this no longer to be allowed."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can only be amazed that, this morning, we did exactly the opposite in a report by the same Mr Belder."
"Mr President, I support the call for urgent procedure."
"Yesterday the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy gave almost unanimous approval to a request for this procedure. There are good reasons to approve such macro-financial aid as a matter of urgency."
"As the House will be aware, the situation has changed considerably since the murder of the then Prime Minister Mr Zoran Dzindzic in March of last year. The present economic situation calls for urgent action by the European Union."
"Does anybody wish to speak against the urgent procedure?"
"Mr President, I did not quite understand. Has Mr Turmes just proposed to vote in favour of the urgent procedure or against?"
"It was not altogether clear."
"Mr Turmes, could you please clarify this?"
"My tongue is a bit slow this early in the morning."
"We are against."
"We now come to the vote on the request for urgent procedure."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four recommendations for second reading:"
"- A5-0327/2003 by Mr Jarzembowski, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community’s railways [8011/3/2003 – C5-0295/2003 – 2002/0025(COD)];"
"- A5-0325/2003 by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on safety on the Community's railways and amending Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification (Railway Safety Directive) [8557/2/2003 – C5-0297/2003 – 2002/0022(COD)];"
"- A5-0321/2003 by Mrs Ainardi, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 96/48/EC of the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and Directive 2001/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system [8556/2/2003 – C5-0298/2003 – 2002/0023(COD)]."
"- A5-0323/2003 by Mr Savary, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a European Railway Agency (Agency Regulation) [8558/2003 – C5-0296/2003 – 2002/0024(COD)]."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is early in the morning, and those of us who work in the domain of transport policy are delighted to have the opportunity to debate transport issues in the morning for once rather than at 9 or 10 p.m."
"We hope that a few journalists are here too on this occasion, because the evenings are always so long, and so it is sometimes a little difficult to adhere to scheduled starting times."
"Anyway, without further ado, let us turn to the matter in hand."
"What we are discussing today are better conditions for railway operations in the European Union."
"By means of the three directives and one regulation, we seek to ensure that conditions are improved to such an extent that the railways in Europe will again be able to transport more goods and more passengers."
"As the rapporteur for the Directive on the development of the Community’s railways, allow me to begin by expressing my great satisfaction at the Council’s acceptance of our parliamentary position, which, contrary to the Commission’s proposal, advocates the preservation of the Trans-European Rail Freight Network that was established on 15 March 2003."
"Since that date, this first step towards the opening of the rail network in the fifteen EU Member States, which effectively covers 90% of the main rail corridors, has presented rail operators, irrespective of their national origins, with an equal opportunity to use the European rail network for international freight traffic in a way that best suits the needs of customers."
"Secondly, Parliament agrees with the Council regarding the opening of the remaining lines in the rail network to international freight traffic on 1 January 2006."
"That, however, is by no means a huge leap forward, since, as I just mentioned, practically 90% of total track mileage was opened to international freight traffic on 15 March of this year."
"Consequently, Parliament continues to call for the rail networks to be fully opened to national as well as international freight operators on 1 January 2006 so that the entire EU rail network will be open to all freight services, be they national or international, on that date."
"In this way we can truly achieve the aim set down in the Commission White Paper – and I am grateful, Commissioner, that we have always followed the same line here – to restore rail transport to its former market position by 2010 and to transfer as much freight as possible to the railways."
"The aim is more comprehensive than this, however."
"The White Paper is not just about freight; it is about striking a balance between the various modes of transport by the year 2010."
"For this reason, Parliament takes the view that passenger networks must be opened up too."
"If you consider the increase in the number of private cars on the motorways and the growth in the volume of air traffic, you will appreciate that our motorways and air corridors are coming close to saturation point."
"And this is why we in this House want the rail networks to be opened to operators of passenger trains on 1 January 2008."
"Unless we take that step, the shift from road to rail and air to rail that is envisaged for the year 2010 will leave passenger traffic untouched."
"It is quite worrying to see how low-cost air carriers are taking custom away from the European railways."
"I hope, Commissioner, that in the next few days you will have something to say about Charleroi airport in Belgium, because it is not acceptable that the railways should be making huge losses on their long-distance passenger services because the cheap airlines are luring their customers away and congesting our skies."
"In short, we want to ensure that the aim of rebalancing the transport market by 2010 applies to passenger transport too."
"Some people have repeatedly stressed that the Commission has announced the presentation of a third rail package by the end of the year, a package that will include passenger transport."
"That is all very honourable, Commissioner, but it does not help us in any way, because, as you know, if the Commission failed to present this package by December of this year, we could no longer adopt the package, or even give it a first reading, before the end of the current legislative term."
"Even if we did manage the first reading, the intervention of the European parliamentary elections, the appointment of a new Commission and the need to reactivate the legislative process would mean that it would effectively take one to two years to put through a bill on passenger transport, and so we could not adopt a third railway package before 2005."
"I believe, however, that the train operators need to know for certain now whether they will be able to benefit from a legal right of access to the entire network."
"We want them to have time to anticipate the needs of the travelling public so that we are actually able to effect the transfer of a substantial volume of long-distance traffic from road and air to the railways by 2010."
"Lastly, the committee proposed that the existing options allowing Member States to permit companies other than railway undertakings to apply for train paths should be scrapped in favour of a provision enabling consignors, forwarders and the like to apply for the use of train paths alongside railway undertakings in all Member States."
"We believe that every effort must be made to optimise the use of the rail infrastructure."
"We know that there is still spare capacity today, even on the Brenner line, and there is no point in our continued grumbling about HGVs when even this transalpine rail link still has spare capacity."
"In other words, we must enable more players in the market to apply for and use the available train paths if we want to maximise the volume of freight carried by rail."
"Allow me, as the spokesman for my group, to say a few words in anticipation of the other two reports, because it would make no sense for me to sit down and then stand straight back up again."
"I should like to begin these remarks on behalf of my group by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs from the other groups."
"We worked very well together, both at the time of the first reading and in preparation for the present second reading."
"Although Mrs Ainardi, Mr Sterckx, Mr Savary and I differed in our positions on specific points, we always regarded the railways package as an integral whole, hence our close cooperation as rapporteurs."
"I am highly gratified that we are all trying to follow the same line."
"You will be aware that the Council has already tried to find compromises that will enable us to conclude the legislative process quickly."
"The Council, along with the rapporteurs, has basically been trying to reduce the number of points at issue between the Council and Parliament, sometimes by accepting parliamentary positions and sometimes by proposing compromises, with the result that the conciliation procedure will focus on a core of considerably fewer than sixty or seventy points."
"I hope that we shall hear some judicious statements from the Council tomorrow regarding its intention of adhering to the line we began to discuss last week."
"We are interested in reducing the number of disputed points so that we can really focus our full attention on the major problems at the conciliation sessions."
"To this end, my group will carefully examine the latest batch of amendments to the railway directives and will vote accordingly on Thursday."
"Allow me to make two or three remarks on the Sterckx report."
"Mr Sterckx has tried very hard – for which I am grateful to him – to ensure that the European rail-safety standards guarantee a high level of safety and that there is no scope for the introduction by the back door of new national safety rules which would ultimately reinstate arbitrary restrictions on international traffic."
"I believe it is very important that we cooperate with the Commission in order to find a mechanism that prevents the introduction of allegedly essential safety provisions that are actually designed to discriminate against other rail operators."
"My group also attaches importance to the proper training of train crews and all other personnel on whom the safety of rail travel depends."
"We still have a problem here, Commissioner, that being that one directive devoted purely to the training of engine drivers might not suffice."
"We must train all other safety-related personnel to the appropriate standard of qualification."
"I support Mr Sterckx on the last point I wish to address from his report, a point on which I believe we all agree: staff training certificates must not lose their validity when personnel move from one railway undertaking to another."
"We need a single market for engine drivers too."
"We need competition throughout the domain of rail transport."
"Let me turn now to the Savary report. Mr Savary has very carefully incorporated the new budgetary rules, and I believe that the Council will endorse this so that all agencies have uniform budgetary rules and so that we avoid a situation in which each agency has its own rules, creating an incomprehensible tangle of budgetary provisions."
"The main point in the Savary report – and we are right behind the rapporteur on this – is the imbalance in the Council’s proposal for the composition of the Administrative Board."
"The amended proposal made by the Commission is for an Administrative Board comprising six representatives of the Council, four representatives of the Commission, and six non-voting representatives of the industry, in other words of the relevant railway undertakings, and rail users."
"The Council is now proposing that all Member States be represented on the Board."
"This would mean that six representatives of the interested parties, four Commission officials and, from May of next year, twenty-five Council representatives would sit on the Board."
"Only the Council could devise such a ludicrous scheme, and we therefore endorse the rapporteur’s view that we must use the conciliation procedure to put an end to it."
"Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski."
"I wanted to comment briefly on your remark about transport policy being discussed in the morning for once."
"My reply comes from Part Two of Goethe’s : ‘’ (‘For he whose strivings never cease is ours for his redeeming’)."
". – Mr President, it is clear that safety is essential."
"Railway safety is good in most cases at the moment, and it is imperative that it remain good, at least as good as it is now."
"I extend my thanks to many of my fellow Members, therefore, for their valuable contribution to the debate on safety, and also to many people from the railway community, who have made a fair few suggestions, improved the texts, pointed out difficulties and so on."
"If a European rail transport market is established, there must of course also be a European safety system."
"We are creating that by means of this Directive: Common Safety Targets, a method for achieving those targets, and a safety authority in each Member State that uses a common method to give licences to all the parties concerned."
"Following the Council common position, we held a number of discussions, and there followed mediation by the Commission with representatives of the Council."
"We were able to eliminate a whole range of problems, as there were quite a few differences between the common position and our first reading."
"I have tabled a number of compromise amendments about these, which I ask my fellow Members to support, including compromise amendments concerning the driving licence for train drivers – for which we have found a solution via a new Commission proposal – and also concerning interoperability."
"I should also like to stress the importance of the agreement reached by the social partners (the trade unions and the European railway companies)."
"Indeed, I should like to ask that the Commission transpose that agreement as quickly as possible, so that we also demonstrate that we attach great importance to the creation of a social framework for our planned railway reforms."
"I think that this is an important point, and that it must therefore be emphasised."
"A second point on which we reached agreement concerns communications and the crossing of linguistic borders, something on which I had laid a fair amount of emphasis."
"If Mrs Ainardi is in agreement, we shall move that point to the Directive on interoperability, and thus that, too, will be settled."
"There are two significant points on which we disagree with the Council, however."
"The first is the speed at which the new safety system should start off."
"The European Parliament wants to proceed more quickly, and I think that we should stand firm on that view."
"Secondly – as Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out – working towards a European safety system implies keeping the number of new national safety rules that are introduced to an absolute minimum."
"Hence the importance of Article 8: the role of the Commission as supervisor of the system."
"We as a Parliament must stand our ground on that point."
"We have already reached agreement with the Council on a number of points, but one remains, and we do need to negotiate hard about this."
"Indeed, we shall see whether the Council is also able to follow up tomorrow the points on which we reached agreement."
"I think that agreement is possible, and we must strive to achieve it."
"I should now like to talk about the other reports and the whole package: we must keep the four directives as a single package."
"We must enter into the conciliation procedure on those four directives simultaneously."
"In general, the European Parliament is more in favour of an open European rail transport market and of European railway companies than the Council."
"The Council does not yet go as far as this: much less far than the Commission and Parliament."
"We must negotiate hard in the conciliation procedure in order to bring the Council a long way towards our position."
"The decreasing market share held by the railways speaks for itself: our Belgian railways again lost nearly 6% of the freight market in the first half of 2003."
"That is a very regrettable development."
"There is a small increase in passenger transport, but the situation regarding freight has taken another turn for the worse."
"I think that, particularly in our country, inland water transport and coastal water transport are poised to take over that market share."
"It is important, therefore, that the railways defend themselves much more effectively, that they ensure their presence on the market."
"The railways must become more efficient, much more dynamic, than is now the case."
"In some countries they are, but in others they definitely are not."
"Railway companies must not focus on themselves."
"They must focus on their customers, those who use their services, and they must focus on their service – ensure that they are giving their customers the best possible service – so that those customers stay with them, or come back to them."
"I think that this is important."
"Nearly every week I come across a company that says ‘We should indeed like to do a number of things by rail, but it is not possible."
"The railways are bad, too slow, too expensive, unreliable.’"
"In my opinion, these are very regrettable reports, and something must be done in this regard."
"That is the very first aim of this package of directives"
"I should also like to mention that what we are proposing here is not wild capitalism on the railways."
"That is definitely not the aim of the directives that are on the table now."
"This is not an asocial or antisocial package."
"Indeed, my request that the agreement between the social partners be ratified took its inspiration from the social sphere."
"This package gives the railways the opportunity of ‘recapturing’ the transport market."
"My use of a military term is deliberate, because if the railways do not win their share of that transport market back, we shall really see some very serious social carnage."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, an entire programme of parliamentary and institutional work on railways is now drawing to a close. The railways represent a tremendous challenge for Europe and for the future."
"The report on interoperability seeks to make the directives on high-speed and conventional rail systems more consistent. Significantly, it also proposes greater harmonisation."
"This is a way in which the Union can benefit the railways, enabling trains to move freely across the European network."
"The decision to tackle the issue of rail was made on the basis of the ongoing decline of rail as a means of transport in Europe."
"Consequently, the proposals contained in my report seek to support the development of the railways."
"Rail is a sustainable and safe means of transport. In addition, it places different areas on an equal footing."
"Both at a European level and at the level of each Member State, public authorities should take resolute action on railways. They need it."
"The reasons for the decline of the railways are many and serious."
"Moreover, some of these reasons are not related to the aim of my report."
"One such reason is the failure to take account of the environmental costs of road transport, which is the main competitor of rail transport."
"The decline of the railways is also linked to problems concerning finance."
"On this issue, I am bound to refer back to what I said previously and I can only reiterate that this aspect is far from satisfactory."
"The time will come when it will be necessary to make available means that match our stated ambitions."
"I would now like to turn to the recommendation for second reading of my report."
"Although there was general agreement on the common position, my report includes the proposals made by the relevant parliamentary committee at first reading. This is progress."
"I would like to cite two examples. First, there is the proposal seeking to equip trains with recording devices."
"With satellite control, these devices will greatly enhance the flow of rail traffic by monitoring changes in real time. They will also increase safety."
"Rail employees put this proposal to me at the very beginning of the first reading and it has now been accepted by the Council. In my opinion, this is a good example of how we can improve parliamentary work by taking the time to debate issues with the main parties involved and to listen to them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to draw your attention to the amendment seeking to replace the phrase ‘minimum level of safety’ with ‘optimum level’."
"It was important to eliminate any ambiguity concerning the possibility of a ‘levelling down’ type of harmonisation. Allowing safety standards to differ between Member States might suggest that harmonisation could be used to reduce safety standards so as to facilitate access for new entrants."
"On the contrary, it is essential to ensure that all rail users respect the complete set of standards guaranteeing better safety."
"I would now like to turn to the other reports on the rail package."
"I support the proposals of my fellow Member Mr Savary on a European Railway Agency."
"I think the proposals for each and every one of the players to be represented on the Administrative Board of the agency are essential to progress."
"I believe it is very important for rail employees and their organisations to contribute to the process of drawing up the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs)."
"I agree with a number of the proposals made by Mr Sterckx on safety."
"I believe each Member State’s particular situation and know-how must be taken into account. In addition, however, I feel it is important to allow sufficient time."
"For historic reasons, our rail networks are extremely complex. Effective change must take account of the human factor."
"I would also like to highlight the issue of national standards."
"It is essential for Member States to retain the right and the ability to improve their safety conditions and systems. If this right were removed, there would be a serious risk of them all being reduced to the lowest common denominator when the aim should be to help all networks increase their safety levels."
"Lastly, our rapporteur will understand that I do not agree with amending our objectives, including opening up the sector to competition and considering this action to be as important as safety."
"Everyone has their own opinion on opening up the sector to competition."
"We happen not to agree on the subject."
"It is, however, a shame to make a hotchpotch in a directive that has harmonisation and improvement of safety as its main objective."
"As for Mr Jarzembowski’s report, I have to say that I do not share his desire for liberalisation."
"We have only just begun on the process of transposing the previous directive and an assessment of its impact is required."
"The rail sector is of such social and economic importance that the precautionary principle must be applied."
"No one would want the European rail system to experience the same mishaps, not to mention disasters, which have befallen certain other networks."
"Liberalisation at any cost implies certain theoretical assumptions."
"This can prove dangerous and has been shown to have disastrous consequences for the railways, employment and the social and economic situation."
"These are the grounds on which we rejected the proposals to accelerate the opening up of both the national and international freight sector, proposals which unfortunately were accepted by the Council. Since we rejected these proposals, it follows that we cannot support Parliament’s bid to liberalise passenger transport if the report is accepted."
"All, or almost all, of the main players in the sector are united in their opposition to this plan."
"This support for liberalisation is all the more surprising given that the attempts to establish freight corridors have not yet borne fruit save in the context of cooperation."
"Europe needs to learn from experience."
"It also needs a public rail service it can be proud of."
"In our opinion, this is what is at stake."
"Lastly, while I agree with Mr Jarzembowski’s idea that the rail package constitutes a whole, and while we all agree on promoting rail transport, and moving forward in this direction, I do not think this necessarily entails liberalisation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to say how pleased I am with how this second rail package is progressing. More generally, I am also very happy with the admirable work to promote railways undertaken during this period."
"Nonetheless, we are all united in the common cause of boosting the rail sector and of giving it new hope. It is a case of convincing all the players in the rail sector that Europe is not out to handicap national rail networks."
"Nowadays, we are judged on how well we discharge our responsibilities. In so-called transit and junction countries like mine the trend towards transporting everything by lorry has led to intolerable situations."
"Significant political tensions have arisen in such countries. These tensions came to the fore over the Mont Blanc incidents and a similar situation is arising in connection with the Pyrenees."
"This second rail package has several dimensions. Firstly, it has a very strong technical dimension, which is embodied in particular in the report by Mrs Ainardi."
"We fully support her report and I personally support it unreservedly, in particular because it provides for the installation of black boxes, something that is Mrs Ainardi’s personal wish. The Sterckx report addresses technical concerns too and is also important as it establishes European safety standards."
"There is, therefore, no question of opening up the sector without providing a safety net. Careful preparations will be made."
"Safety will be at the heart of the opening up process. Safety must always be our objective and our watchword."
"In this connection, I have a more qualified opinion about the relationship between national safety standards and European safety standards."
"I believe safety cannot be sacrificed in the interests of freedom."
"As regards the rail sector, safety is obviously crucial at all times to the work of railway employees."
"Nevertheless, I think it is essential not to use standards as a pretext for preventing other trains from using a particular network. Personally, I hope an appropriate agreement upholding the safety imperative will be reached on this matter."
"Lastly, for the first time these texts have a very significant social dimension to them, which fills me with great hope."
"I share the view that far greater progress has been made on integrating the European Union’s roads than on integrating its railways and I have said as much. The reason why rail is lagging behind is that so far railway employees have failed to understand that we are also trying to integrate the railway employees of the European Union, which will be to their benefit too."
"Significant progress has been made, nonetheless. Firstly, there is the establishment of the Agency."
"This achievement is down to my fellow Members, and to the understanding and ongoing support of the Commission and the Council. The Agency will bring employers and employees together for the first time."
"I think we should feel satisfied with this."
"I believe this agency should be a common forum for the rail sector."
"This was why we sought to include employees’ representatives as well as bringing together rail users, rail companies and infrastructure managers."
"I trust Amendment No 4 and Amendment No 5 will be upheld. In particular, I hope the provision in Article 3 for trade unions in working groups will be retained."
"I believe this represents a considerable step forward."
"Both the Sterckx and the Ainardi reports uphold the principle of the primacy of social dialogue in the legislative processes of the European Union."
"Whenever employers and unions can come to an agreement, within a suitable time frame, the need to legislate can be avoided. Legislation can then be drafted at a later date."
"From this point of view, the developments regarding the driver’s licence mark a turning point."
"This is the first time the 32 rail companies and union representatives have reached such an agreement which will form the basis of a text."
"This text will, of course, inform the Commission’s work too. Thanks to the agreement, the Commission’s work will have far greater legitimacy than it would otherwise have had."
"I hope all this augurs the establishment in the very near future of a convention bringing together all European rail employees."
"I believe that this will trigger the liberation of European Union railways and lead to their rapid integration."
"Liberalisation is also an issue. My views on this are much more qualified than those of Mr Jarzembowski."
"I am not sure that it is very useful to keep changing the agenda."
"I am not sure that liberalisation is the only basis for integrating the railways of the European Union. Indeed, I believe the opposite is the case."
"Clearly, it is important to ensure trains can travel freely across all Member States. In my view, however, many other conditions still remain to be met for railways to regain their rightful status and be able to compete with road transport."
"I am not sure we should address the issue of passenger transport prematurely. We must not adopt a blinkered approach."
"In my opinion, there is no point in setting a date without being fully aware of what is involved, particularly on the economic front."
"I fear we may be drawn inexorably towards a collision of all the risks. The nearer the elections draw, the greater are the opportunities for the Council to diminish certain positions."
"I regret this but we shall move together in that direction, Georg, because we all accepted that this is a rail package."
"Commissioner, I would like to finish by saying that we attach great importance to the budgetary aspect."
"I am concerned that the directive on European tax discs falls short of the ambitions of the White Paper. It will allow national taxation policies to be implemented, which is likely to result in many contradictions concerning tax deductions and the allocation of these funds."
"I would have preferred a Swiss-style system for the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say first of all that work on this second rail package is proceeding in a highly satisfactory manner. It is certainly satisfactory to be holding this debate in the morning, with the benefit of plenty of light and with Minute-takers present."
"Issues of this kind are usually consigned to evening sittings. I would therefore like to reiterate how delighted I am to be dealing with them in prime parliamentary time."
"I believe this programming is an indication of the widespread recognition of the importance of the subject under discussion. In particular, it reflects the importance attributed to it by the House."
"I would like to begin by thanking Parliament most sincerely for all the work undertaken over the years. As several honourable Members recalled, we have now been working together for a long time in the hope of breathing new life into European railways and ensuring the recovery of rail transport."
"I should like to thank the four rapporteurs very much for their excellent work. I admit to being one of those who would have preferred to conclude at second reading."
"Nonetheless, we are proceeding to conciliation. It is to be hoped that the amendments will be adopted tomorrow and will provide what little further clarification is required on the minor points remaining for discussion in Council."
"Throughout the time we have worked together we have contrived to find solutions to most of the problems raised. We have also clarified our positions and found ways forward resulting in compromises and agreements."
"I should like to begin by responding to Mr Savary. The Commission(1) does not object to most of the amendments tabled concerning the European Railway Agency."
"We are only opposed to five of the 32 amendments tabled. Essentially, we adopted this stance on the grounds of legal clarity or in the interests of avoiding complications or excessive bureaucracy in the Agency’s work."
"I think it is worth emphasising that the Commission does support the amendments relating to the composition of the Administrative Board. The rapporteur has just referred to these."
"We have cooperated in an exemplary manner. I should state that the Commission is able to support the two amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx at the eleventh hour."
"Mr Sterckx was the rapporteur for the directive on safety on the Community’s railways. A large number of amendments to this directive were tabled."
"This illustrates Parliament’s wish to forge ahead more quickly in this area. We are of course also eager to do so."
"Nonetheless, some of the amendments tabled incorporate provisions that already exist in the directives on interoperability. Others refer to provisions that will appear in our proposal on driving licences for train drivers due towards the end of this year."
"Further amendments relate to systematic shortening of the deadlines for drafting European texts on rail safety. The Council had already drastically shortened the deadlines."
"I therefore believe this is not about being arbitrary but about being realistic. The Council had already shortened the deadlines contained in the initial proposals."
"A balance seems to have been reached. In that connection, I maintain that for the future agency to succeed from the outset, it must not be overloaded with work."
"It is also worth mentioning the issue of national safety rules and their monitoring at Community level. These are the most significant amendments, especially in the context of preparing for the vote in the Council."
"We therefore support his amendments to Article 8. Once again, I should like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work."
"Turning to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, it should be noted that it falls into two parts. One concerns freight transport and the other passenger transport."
"We fully support Parliament’s amendments regarding freight transport. It should be borne in mind, however, that eventually agreement will need to be reached with the Council concerning deadlines and authorised applicants."
"Regarding passenger transport, I am well aware of Parliament’s position. The House made this abundantly clear at first reading."
"I informed the Council accordingly. The vote in plenary at first reading in Parliament was dealt with as appropriate."
"The Commission is also fully aware that this position has been maintained in the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I should reiterate before the House that we appreciate the concerns underlying these amendments. The Commission has, however, given an undertaking to Parliament and to the Council to present a proposal on opening up passenger transport to competition."
"The texts are more complex than they appear at first sight. The document should be available to you in a month and a half."
"It is indeed the case that even if the Commission presents the proposal on time, it will not be possible to debate it during this term. Mr Jarzembowski was quite right to point that out."
"The debate could perhaps be launched, but I suspect it would not be possible to conclude the first reading."
"On this subject, I would like to say to honourable Members that the Commission will present the text. We trust this Parliament will begin work on it, and that it or its successor will bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion."
"We are all fully aware of the importance of opening up passenger transport to competition. Furthermore, as soon as the Trans-European network is established it will be essential to stop thinking in terms of national criteria for railways and begin to consider European railway criteria."
"Henceforth, the geographical reference context will be the whole of Europe, not one specific country or another. It will be necessary to think in terms of the European network as a whole."
"Consequently, all the companies already in existence in the various European countries must have free access to that European network. Once access is granted, the companies will compete amongst themselves."
"That is the logical outcome of the steps taken."
"As soon as a European railway law comes into force, existing European operators will begin to compete amongst themselves."
"Competition will automatically come about as soon as Europe becomes the reference area, rather than some specific country."
"This is not an ideological issue. It is a fact."
"It is simply a logical consequence of the nature of the measures adopted."
"It is one of the advantages of European integration."
"In addition, I should say that I believe this kind of competition will spur the railway companies to modernise. Modernisation is sorely needed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I certainly agree with you that the safety criterion is crucial. It must remain so."
"Safety needs to be the aim and the watchword of rail transport. It must not be compromised by the other changes envisaged."
"Finally, Mr Jarzembowski, I should like to congratulate you on your efforts and on the work you have put in. I understand your position, one shared by a substantial majority of the House, but I am unable to support those amendments."
"I can, however, provide an assurance that the text on opening up passenger transport to competition will be presented before the end of the year."
"As I conclude, I should like to thank the rapporteurs once again."
"Mrs Ainardi, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary have all done splendid work."
"Thanks are also due to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and to the whole House."
"The first rail package was completed during this Parliamentary term. If the second package is concluded before the term comes to an end, this Parliament will be able to pride itself on having moved European rail freight transport forward into the twenty-first century."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal is staked on the restructuring of Europe’s railways."
"We must ensure that the twenty-first century marks the revival of rail travel in Europe, otherwise we shall have a gridlocked road network with all its repercussions on people’s lives, on the environment and on the economy."
"The railways, of course, cannot be synonymous with long-distance transport as they were in the nineteenth century, but they should be an important link in a chain comprising all the modes of transport – air, road, sea, waterway and rail."
"In order to play their part in this chain, the railways must be up to the tasks required of them."
"They must be fully integrated within their own structures, and the grandiloquent concept of intermodal transport must be fleshed out so that the links between the various modes of transport can actually work in practice."
"Time is short, which is why Parliament was dissatisfied – and, indeed, is still not quite satisfied – with the original timetable, but we do see signs of movement, and we hope that there will be further movement – and very soon, please, if possible."
"Accordingly, we stand by our earlier proposals."
"Especially with regard to the package covered by Mrs Ainardi’s report, we stand by our stated position, and we must insist on the realisation of interoperability throughout the network."
"This, of course, cannot be fully achieved unless it is an effective binding requirement for all parts of the rail network and unless steps are taken to ensure that international transport operations are not obstructed again by piecemeal measures."
"In the drafting and adoption of technical specifications, consideration must be given to the economic costs, and care must be taken to ensure that the requisite safety standards are in place and that due account is taken of environmental and social concerns too."
"One of the main prerequisites for an entirely effective and safe trans-European high-speed rail network is a functioning system of communication, especially between those who conduct operations and those who oversee them."
"For this reason we need an appropriate code of terminology for operational communications."
"Rather than organising all of this on the basis of the lowest common denominator and minimum safety levels, we must guarantee compliance with the highest possible standards."
"Finally, allow me, as an Austrian, to take this opportunity to comment on another subject that has been in the news again in recent days."
"I refer to the proposed regulation on the ecopoints system for HGVs travelling through Austria, which was the subject of the Caveri report and which has now gone to conciliation, although the conciliation process has not yet begun in earnest."
"In this context, may I make an urgent appeal, especially to the Council and its President-in-Office, Mr Lunardi, to ensure that the most directly affected countries are able to agree on a common position so that they can signal to everyone, including Parliament, that the deadlock is being broken."
"The deadlock needs to be broken; once it has, Mr Schmid’s earlier quotation from Goethe can be applied to the ecopoints issue too, albeit in a slightly modified form: ‘For he whose strivings never cease will finally achieve success’."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteurs on their sterling work and on their close cooperation with all the other members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"In my contribution to this debate, I should like to focus on the work that Mr Jarzembowski has done and to enumerate the conditions in which liberalisation can truly succeed."
"As far as freight transport is concerned, there are no differences between us; we agree on the need for liberalisation or opening of the market in freight transport, because, over the past few years, and indeed decades, the percentage of freight transported by rail has steadily fallen."
"This is not the result of liberalisation, which came along much later. On the contrary, liberalisation is actually a necessary, albeit inadequate, response to this development."
"The domain of road haulage has experienced the very liberalisation that we actually want to see in the realm of rail transport."
"National borders now present virtually no obstacle to international road transport within the European Union, nor do divergent technical or safety standards."
"The external cost of road transport, however, is not borne by carriers, which has been to their advantage, and the road network has received massive amounts of public investment."
"The primacy of road over rail cannot be regarded as the triumph of free enterprise over nationalised industries, because road transport could not have flourished without public investment."
"As far as passenger transport is concerned, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her explanatory remarks, and I hope that the pragmatism and logic of her arguments have also convinced Mr Jarzembowski, who is not entirely immune to the sort of cogent argument of which the Commissioner availed herself so amply today."
"Let us be honest: the crucial point is not whether the rules take effect in 2005 or not; what is crucial is that they are introduced at some time in the next few years."
"We are in agreement on that point."
"My group will vote for the Jarzembowski report, but I should like to say very clearly on its behalf that attempts to liberalise freight transport will only succeed if they are accompanied by greater flexibility on passenger transport."
"Freight transport must take precedence for the reasons I have given, subject to certain conditions."
"The successful liberalisation of rail transport will also depend on measures such as the harmonisation of technical specifications and safety standards."
"Much has been said about this already, and we fully agree with what we have heard."
"The obstacles to a single European market that still exist in this domain must be systematically removed."
"This is a challenge to politicians throughout Europe and more particularly to both sides of the rail industry."
"Which brings me to the second condition."
"It has become fashionable today to implement reforms that run counter to the interests of the people who are most directly affected by them, namely the workforce."
"I believe it would be better if we could secure the support of employees, particularly railway employees, for reforms and changes."
"The agreement reached a few days ago on train drivers’ licences is a very good sign."
"If we assign responsibility to the two sides of the rail industry – employers and employees – subject, of course, to the proviso that failure to exercise this responsibility will result in an imposed political decision, I firmly believe that they will arrive at an effective solution, as has happened in the case of the train drivers’ licence."
"I hope that this is indeed the start of a constructive partnership between management and labour in the rail industry."
"Thirdly, liberalisation will only work if more funds are invested in the infrastructure."
"Reference has already been made to the electricity market, to the situation in the United Kingdom, for example."
"If we liberalise but do not strive to ensure that there are sufficient incentives for investment, there is a real danger that networks will collapse and that the seeds of insecurity will be sown."
"After all, the aims of competition are to push prices down, which also reduces profit margins for infrastructure operators, and to achieve better or fuller use of the infrastructure."
"If no compensatory or supporting public investments are made, serious problems can arise."
"I am somewhat saddened by the fact that, following a very good submission or submissions to the Council by the Commission, no clear statement has emerged on investments in the trans-European networks, particularly on additional incentives, in other words the 30% that the Commission is seeking for cross-border projects."
"We must encourage all the Member States to step up their investment in the rail network, with special emphasis – needless to say – on cross-border measures."
"How do we want to bring Europe together if there is insufficient investment in the rail infrastructure?"
"I hope that a statement on this point will be forthcoming at the December summit, if not before."
"And let me reiterate my gratitude to the Commission, which has done so much good groundwork."
"My last prerequisite for the success of liberalisation is the creation of a level playing field."
"As I have already mentioned, one of the many reasons why road transport has established its supremacy is that road users do not pay the external costs, in other words the environmental costs. They pay neither for the additional wear and tear caused by heavy vehicles nor for the environmental damage caused by vehicle emissions."
"The Commissioner has presented a Directive on infrastructure pricing that I do not find entirely satisfactory, because I feel it offers too little scope for the rectification of this imbalance."
"I do find it alarming, however, to read about what has been happening in the Council, to learn how little approval and support there is for the position adopted by the Commission."
"I hope that this House will support the Commission more strongly on this issue, and I should like to express my thanks once again to the rapporteurs for their efforts in this direction."
"Mr Jarzembowski has produced an excellent piece of work."
"All he has to do now is to make that leap of faith and focus on freight transport; above all, he should fully endorse the position of his esteemed colleague, Commissioner De Palacio, and then we shall arrive at a good decision."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank the MEPs – the rapporteurs – who have done so much work in order to put a coherent package on the table; because that is what the finished product is."
"Since last week, I have been able to see with my own eyes that it is indeed possible to do business on the railways in Europe."
"I visited a private company in Rotterdam that now transports half of its containers by rail: that means a 50% market share compared to the old monopolists that are stuck in their ways."
"The entry of private entrepreneurs into the market has therefore contributed towards halting the comparative loss of a mode of transport."
"We must therefore encourage more private players to invest in the use of the railways, so as to secure their future as an alternative mode of transport."
"I admire and endorse Mr Jarzembowski’s commitment to going the full distance with the railways and also to the aspiration of liberalising passenger transport by 2008."
"I do hope that the Council adopts this."
"I should also like to warn, however, that in so doing we must not hinder a number of countries from liberalising freight transport."
"Here, I am referring in particular to countries such as France and Belgium: although their organisations are investing abroad, they do not permit foreign undertakings to develop activities on their railways."
"I hope that, by January 2006, that will be a thing of the past, and I do believe that it will."
"Safety and interoperability go hand in hand, and are also the most important reason why the railways have the potential to be a good, quick and competitive mode of transport compared to road transport."
"For that to be the case, however, a great deal will have to change."
"I have observed that a train travelling from the Netherlands to southern Germany – through two countries and three – has seven changes of locomotive."
"It is absolutely ridiculous that this is supposed to be the alternative to road transport."
"I am happy, therefore, that there is an excellent proposal on the table here that will enable us to eradicate conditions such as these."
"It will enable us to ensure that we have uniform training throughout Europe, a single, recognisable, system, which is accessible and also promotes through-travel; thus increasing the real speed of freight railways, and, with it, safety and reliability."
"I should like to advocate that a great deal of attention be paid to the interconnection of route plans at international level, therefore."
"This will clear the way for those wishing to travel by rail to be able to do so."
"This would necessitate interconnection of routes."
"Such things must not be organised separately for each and each country."
"An all-encompassing, integrated approach is required, and I think that it is extremely important that this proposal is on the table."
"In my opinion, this issue of safety and interoperability presents us with a very good chance of making the railways an attractive mode of transport, alongside road transport and also alongside transport over water."
"I think that this represents a step that is of considerable importance to freight transport throughout Europe."
"– Mr President, rail transport was once started by private companies who anticipated making a profit by doing so."
"Their railway lines did not form a coherent network and were mostly inaccessible to other companies with different kinds of trains."
"Many of those companies went bankrupt or were notable for their poor-quality, frequently interrupted service."
"When that system failed, State-owned companies came along, and tried to develop a uniform model for their respective countries as far as possible."
"Rail transport became a core responsibility of the State."
"We have now reached a phase in which a large-scale uniform European model is aspired to on the one hand, but at the same time a return to the nineteenth century model of individual private companies is being propagated."
"Those two aims will probably prove difficult to reconcile in practice, and be a constant source of tension."
"The champions of this model hold up transport companies that have undergone prolific growth in the free market, such as airlines and HGV companies, as an example to the railways, which they see as outmoded."
"They believe that freedom of competition will lead to growth and make the railways attractive to a broader clientele that has not been using them up to now."
"Others fear that liberalisation will only lead to a separation between profitable and loss-making activities and to cutbacks in infrastructure, service and staff, resulting in a deterioration in safety and a rise in fares."
"In their view, there are more grounds for entrusting long-distance cross-border transport to effective coordination between the existing State companies or to one individual European company than for making room for new private companies; and measures to restrict environmentally unfriendly air and road transport are a good supplement to that."
"The four reports that are on the agenda today are a product of this major difference of opinion."
"They all have in common that they envisage an important role for rail transport again in the future, too; and that represents progress in relation to the time when the railways were consigned to the museum of nineteenth century curiosities."
"Opinion differs widely on the means to achieve this, however."
"The Jarzembowski report is one of an endless succession of attempts at greater and faster liberalisation, not only for cross-border freight transport, but even for domestic passenger transport."
"Although I am not a supporter of great power on the part of the Council, I hope that, if a majority in this Parliament supports the rapporteur, the Council will restrict such an attempt this time, too."
"The Sterckx report places rather less emphasis on a free market, but takes a fairly centralistic view, such that it leaves insufficient scope for national and regional measures."
"The Ainardi and Savary reports are aimed at quality for society, users and staff, and thus have my support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, along with the entire communications infrastructure and the media, the rail network is crucial to turning the European Union into a political entity without frontiers. This is as much the case now as it has been in the development of modern states over the last 200 years."
"These services are needed for economic progress and modernisation, just as the measure of extending the high speed network is also required, at present, in order to dynamise and revitalise productive activity."
"The rail package, therefore, is not simply a new tool enabling private companies to do business as quickly as possible, but is rather a tool for building the road to political, economic and social integration throughout the Union. My group rejects Mr Jarzembowski’s report, since his approach runs counter to the one outlined above, but will vote in favour of the Sterckx report on safety, the Ainardi report on interoperability, and the Savary report on the European Railway Agency, which are compatible with it."
"For me, as a Galician, and for all inhabitants of nations located far from the geographical centre of Europe, these European Parliament decisions should, of course, be a way for us to gain access to high-speed communication with the whole of Europe."
"The plan for investment in infrastructure currently being developed by the Commission should share this aim, bearing in mind above all the fact that railways are kinder to nature and also more favourable to social welfare than any other transport network."
"– Mr President, the aim of these proposals is to give an impetus to the railway sector so that it may become an attractive and viable alternative to other modes of transport."
"Judging from the reactions to the White Paper, that has broad support."
"The only question is how it should be done."
"A drastic change in attitude is needed within the sector."
"This package undoubtedly has the potential to contribute to this, provided it is properly developed and implemented."
"An important element is access to the market."
"Who receives user rights – and what for?"
"In order to stand up to competition with road transport, forwarders and consignors need comparable freedom."
"That is to say, the parties involved in freight transport need direct access to the network."
"Whether it is advisable to claim this for passenger transport, too, in the short term, I venture to doubt."
"If we give entrepreneurs this scope, it is important that we lay down clear rules on use and safety."
"In our opinion, Mr Sterckx has put his finger on the relevant areas."
"We agree with most of his proposals, therefore."
"The same goes for a number of proposals contained in the report by Mrs Ainardi."
"As regards the functioning of the Agency, the development of the railways in recent decades has not produced what we had hoped."
"The Agency should therefore provide the impetus for a new direction."
"We should take this into consideration when it comes to the participation of the various parties concerned."
"All in all, we have here a solid package that will hopefully enable us to create some scope for the sector to develop."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the treatment of these reports as a single unit named ‘rail package’, whereby various part-aspects of the railways issue are covered – for example safety on the Community’s railways, the development of high-speed lines, the granting of licences to railway undertakings, and the levying of charges and the allocation of railway infrastructure – presents me with the opportunity of drawing Parliament’s attention today, in the course of the discussion on the trans-European rail system, to the continuing blocking of the ‘Iron Rhine’ dossier."
"The Iron Rhine is an outstanding example of a European transport line that is useful to an open economy."
"After all, the Iron Rhine in the Ruhr area of the German hinterland opens up not only the port of Antwerp, but also the ports of Ghent, Zeebrugge and Ostend."
"The Iron Rhine already exists, and has proved its usefulness in the past, but it fell into disuse some decades ago because the costs of environmental adjustment, such as tunnelling in certain places, became much too high for the line to be made profitable in a short space of time."
"This, however, is a bogus argument that the Dutch Government hides behind when continually blocking the matter."
"Nowadays, however, Flanders feels the need to reactivate this railway line, in view of the growing problems with container traffic in Flanders, the Netherlands and Germany, which is growing at an exponential rate."
"Germany, and more particularly the North Rhine-Westphalia, has been supporting Flanders for years in making this economically necessary call."
"Unfortunately, however, the Netherlands is conducting a policy of obstruction in this matter, one that is dictated by its own plans to provide the port of Rotterdam with a modern connection to the Ruhr area via the extortionate and environmentally damaging Betuwe Line, from which, however, not a single European country stands to derive any economic benefit."
"For years, therefore, the situation has been deadlocked in this way: this benefits no one, and has only resulted in great economic damage to the Flemish ports and to container traffic."
"Now that Europe has formally recognised the importance of transnational railway lines, I should like to express my hope, as a Fleming and a , that a breakthrough – one that offers a satisfactory solution for all parties – be sought at European level in the Iron Rhine dossier that is so important to Flanders."
"Mr Sterckx on a point of order."
"To which of the Rules of Procedure does your point relate?"
"– Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement."
"I should like to point out that Mr Dillen’s group – his predecessors – when I proposed ..."
"I must inform you that personal statements may be made at the end of a debate rather than during it."
"Our Rules of Procedure are perfectly clear on that point."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I should like to congratulate the four rapporteurs on the work they have done and to wish them continuing success, because it is obvious that the conciliation procedure with the Council is going to follow."
"I should like to focus mainly to start with on the question of the liberalisation of the railways, in order to make a number of political observations, in the belief that behind the discussions on individual amendments and technical arrangements we are losing the substance."
"Ladies and gentlemen, shipping has been liberalised for a great many years now."
"Road transport in Europe has been liberalised for a number of years now."
"The same applies to air transport."
"I think this is a paradox."
"There is no justification for why the railways in particular should be shackled and why there should not be a single network and free competition at European level."
"I should honestly like someone to explain this to me in good faith, not hidden behind the interests of certain groups or companies, but on the basis of the rules of common sense."
"We must always bear in mind that we cannot talk about a single European market if we do not have a single transport network."
"And unless the rail network is also liberalised, this cannot be achieved."
"All the more so in that all the political powers of Europe want, theoretically at least, to promote the railways, because they are an environmentally-friendly means of transport."
"Consequently, it is vital that we proceed with courageous steps in the field of liberalisation and I would honestly say to you that, if I personally had to decide what needed to be done on the railway market, I would liberalise it tomorrow morning."
"Tomorrow morning, of course taking all the steps needed for safety rules, so that we have liberalisation at a high level with no risk to passengers, as is the case in air transport. Having said which, I think it is absurd to continue this debate, which keeps putting the issue off and looks like a rearguard battle which quite simply, in my opinion, seeks to serve specific interests."
"However, in all events, we need to operate here not on the basis of my personal wishes but on the basis of political consensus."
"Parliament, for years at the vanguard of the liberalisation of the railways, is quite right to insist on the amendments made at first reading and I hope that, within the framework of the conciliation which will follow, we shall be able, with the Italian Presidency, to find the best possible result by December."
"I hope that the Commissioner will help us with the statement she has made and which may be used as a final refuge so that, immediately afterwards, we can proceed to liberalise the railway market as far as passengers are concerned."
"Thereafter, the permanent concern of Parliament, and obviously of our group, is safety."
"That is why we talk in the Sterckx report of black boxes, as used on ships and in aeroplanes."
"That is why we talk about European driving licences for train drivers, that is why, in the report by Mrs Ainardi, we raise the question of funding for interoperability, because we want interoperability at a high level and not at a minimum level, as the Council wants."
"We shall proceed in this spirit, hoping that, by the end of the Italian Presidency at the end of December, we shall have the best possible result on the criterion of the liberalisation of the railway market, not because we consider it an end in itself, but because we believe that it is the best way of serving the European economy, European consumers and the workers themselves, in that more jobs will be created."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all our rapporteurs for their work on a complicated yet important area within the transport brief, namely our railways and the future of our railways."
"I would like to start with the issue of freight and what has been said about it."
"In the area of rail freight, the rail industry is presently sitting in the 'last chance saloon'."
"Unless we all pull together to develop rail freight on a European-wide scale – including opening up national networks, more progress on inter-operability and changes in the way the industry thinks and works – there will be no rail freight to defend or be worth mentioning by the year 2020."
"It will have disappeared on to the roads mainly, with all the consequences that will entail."
"So I start this morning with a friendly warning to the railway industry that unless it gets its act together, and unless we all work together in the area of rail freight, it will disappear in 20 years or so."
"Of course, any action along those lines must be based on cooperation with the trade unions and the social partners."
"A theme that my group has consistently pushed for, for many years now."
"In that regard, I welcome some of the agreements recently undertaken between the ETF and the CER, particularly the issue of driving licences, as well as the commitment from the Commission to come forward with a proposal at the end of the year on that subject."
"With regard to passengers, I would urge caution."
"I note that my colleague Mr Hatzidakis says 'be bold'."
"But the problem with that is that one country that decided to be bold with its railways some years back was the United Kingdom."
"The result of that 'boldness' was a botched privatisation that caused absolute chaos in the railway industry and has caused the present government to spend a lot more money on the railways than was planned."
"Yet we still do not have a better service."
"That does not mean that we all retreat into our shells and say that the nationalised railway is the be-all and the end-all."
"That clearly is not the case."
"But we need to ensure that nobody makes the same mistakes as the United Kingdom."
"Liberalisation of the passenger side must proceed step by step."
"In that regard, our rapporteurs have produced a balanced compromise that everyone can live with."
"We must all remember that providing a railway is not just about profit – it is also about safety – but it is also about service and service levels to the people that are supposed to be transported from one place to another."
"In the end, people should come before profit but, sadly, that is not always the case."
"Let me now focus briefly on Mr Sterckz's report which I shadowed for my group."
"I would like to thank him for his work and, in particular, for his efforts to get a compromise solution that is acceptable to us all."
"He should also be congratulated because the battle with the Council – indeed all our rapporteurs' battles with the Council – has made that work especially difficult."
"I just want to say that everybody supports safety."
"No politician is going to stand up here and say that he does not think safety is important, that is political suicide."
"It is a matter of getting the balance right between what is practical and what we can do, as well as making sure that the safety levels we have are as high as possible."
"Sadly, we have had instances on our railways recently where some standards have not been what they should be."
"I again thank the rapporteurs and finish by saying to the railway industry that this is a crucial time for all railways in Europe."
"For freight, this is the last opportunity."
"I hope we do not throw it away."
"Mr Simpson, I should like to congratulate you on your second European act this morning."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to thank the rapporteurs with regard to the rail package."
"They have done excellent work with respect to this important matter."
"The rapporteurs have addressed the issue thoroughly, listened to various experts and committee members, negotiated, and sought viable compromises, keeping all the while to the main goal, which is to improve the competitiveness, safety and compatibility of the railways."
"The proposal for a Railway Agency lends further support to this whole objective."
"Now it is important for the Council not to put the brakes on the implementation of the reforms."
"We have dawdled far too long in the development of the railways."
"It is high time a competitive alternative with regard to railway transport were established."
"Arguments for implementing the rail package have been put forward many times now."
"Developing the railways means we can ease congestion on the roads and encourage environmentally friendly transport."
"A workable railway system and moderately priced and competitive services are important both for congested areas and also the export industry in more remote regions."
"The opening up of competition in freight and passenger transport will encourage the development of rail transport."
"For this a viable package must be created, with a clear timetable too for opening up competition in the field of passenger traffic."
"We must be able to make progress in the areas of technical compatibility and safety standards as well as other regulations, so that trains run throughout Europe speedily and safely, offering a competitive alternative for the transport of both freight and passengers."
"Mr Sterckx’s aim for a high level of safety in rail transport will certainly have the support of everyone."
"The role of the Member States in their adoption of national rules will also be important."
"They should not slow down the long-term process of development, and Member States should obtain the approval of the Commission for new national rules."
"For safety’s sake it is also important for trains to be equipped with a black box and that the data compiled by the equipment and the way that data is processed are standardised."
"The main task of the Railway Agency will be to promote best practice and facilitate cooperation between the players in the railway sector."
"The various players in the railway sector must be involved in the work of the Agency but not every Member State can be represented on the Administrative Board."
"The work of the Agency must nevertheless take account of the different conditions to be found in the Member States."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Speaking both personally and as a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the left-wing group of the European Parliament, I would like to remind you in the clearest possible terms of the principles that must inform the assessment of this European rail package."
"The first principle is that rail transport is a public service."
"Where rail transport is still a public service, it must remain so. Where liberalisation has severely reduced its status as a public service, this must be restored."
"Europe is a densely populated continent, with many urban areas. It also has rural and mountainous areas affected by desertification."
"On our continent rail transport plays an essential role in national and regional development. Only the railways can put a stop to two interrelated tendencies whose consequences are abundantly clear."
"On the one hand there is the unchecked concentration of people in urban areas and on the other the desertification of the countryside. Together, they are laying waste to our land."
"Rail transport is the only effective answer to the rapidly rising demand to transport more and more people and goods. It is also the only answer to the apparently contradictory but equally important need to preserve our environment and increase the quality of our lives."
"These are the grounds on which my group and I oppose the compulsory privatisation of the railways. We also oppose all decisions or measures seeking to regulate the rail industry solely by market forces."
"Countries that went down this road are in a worse position than those that did not. They are in a worse position as lines have been closed."
"Worse, they have serious safety problems. I am sure you know which countries I am referring to."
"On the basis of these three principles, our group opposed what I would term Mr Jarzembowski’s compulsive desire for liberalisation."
"This was also the basis for our rejection of the harmonisation of the networks as proposed in the Sterckx report."
"We would prefer harmonisation to be less of a herald of liberalisation."
"We therefore endorsed the Savary report, concerning the creation of a European Railway Agency. Representatives of employees’ organisations would sit on its Administrative Board."
"Lastly, it was because of these three principles that we voted for Mrs Ainardi’s proposals. The latter provide for social and environmental issues to be taken into account and for high safety requirements."
"Following the decisions of the Council after the first reading, and the recent votes in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, we will again oppose liberalisation of freight transport by 2006 and of passenger transport by 2007."
"We will establish our final position on the Sterckx report on the basis of the results of the vote on the amendments in plenary."
"We will continue to support the reports and positions of Mr Savary and Mrs Ainardi. They are in line with the principles we hold dear."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the national States flourished in the nineteenth century, and that was partly thanks to the railways."
"Well then, in the twenty-first century, Europe must finally be put back on the railways."
"That is why this package is so important."
"In the period between the debate at first reading and this debate, however, the facts have demonstrated that it is still too soon to support Mr Jarzembowski’s high-speed rail system."
"The Sterckx, Ainardi and Savary reports are more in tune with the needs of today."
"My fellow MEP Mr Jarzembowski is impatient and is already arguing in favour of the accelerated liberalisation of passenger transport."
"We are already seeing in a few countries the damage this can do to regional cross-border passenger rail transport."
"Conventional international trains are being cancelled, for example."
"Service is declining in those cases, therefore."
"Surely it cannot be the case that, in a United Europe, non-TGV cross-border rail traffic, of all things, becomes much more expensive or even disappears."
"I have already drawn the Commission’s attention to this, in a parliamentary question, and, in its reply, it shares my opinion, calling this ‘an anomaly in the internal market’."
"Try explaining that to the electorate."
"Another pressing concern is the disappearance of, or change in, the range of international trains that is therefore not being identified."
"I hope that the European Agency carries out a clear evaluation of this, and that we include this aspect in the debate on trans-European networks."
"We shall vote against premature liberalisation without a framework of accompanying measures."
"Mr Simpson has pointed out the potential consequences of this."
"We propose awaiting the proposals that the Commission is going to make at the end of this year with regard to liberalisation."
"That is the point at which we should hold this debate, Mr Jarzembowski, and I hope that we are still able to get through the first reading here, so that this work is not wasted."
"Let us first concentrate on freight transport, however, as that surging flow needs to be put on the railways urgently."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the radical reform of the railways is based on a noble idea."
"The initial aim was to put rail transport back on an equal footing in the face of the success of road transport. While road transport is cheaper and more practical in terms of accessibility, it also causes a great deal of pollution."
"From my point of view, I would have preferred interoperability to be firmly implemented."
"The advocates of this liberalism were spurred on by the Commission’s initial proposal that national and international freight transport should be liberalised."
"They then set their sights still higher. The European Parliament made a higher bid and declared its support for opening up rail passenger transport to competition at the first reading."
"Faced with the opposition of the Council, we are now witnessing an attempt to force this through at the second reading."
"This is quite unacceptable especially as no impact assessment of the first package has demonstrated the benefits of excessive liberalisation."
"Perhaps we would be afraid of the result."
"As a member of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, I cannot subscribe to Amendment No 2 or Amendment No 7. They take liberalisation too far."
"Such liberalisation would particularly affect France. In France, international passenger transport accounts for 20% of rail passenger transport whereas the figure for other countries is between 2 and 7%."
"The desertification of the least profitable areas of the country is inevitable."
"What will become of life in country areas? These are of little interest to private operators looking to make a profit."
"The concept of rail transport is that of a precious public service that contributes to social cohesion and to harmonious national and regional development."
"Lastly, where liberalisation has been badly managed, there have unfortunately been more and more accidents, indicating a dearth of investment. It has even been necessary to renationalise in some cases."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have been invited to decide at the second reading on the schedule for opening up freight rail services to competition."
"The common position of the Council is 1 January 2006 for opening up international freight services and 1 January 2008 for national freight services."
"No schedule for passenger rail transport has been established."
"The Council has adopted a prudent approach taking account of the need to move ahead stage by stage."
"On the other hand, our rapporteur advocates doing away with the schedule altogether. He proposes instead that all crossborder freight and passenger services be opened up as of 1 January 2006 and all services across the network as of 1 January 2008."
"We must question whether it is pertinent to lump everything together in this way."
"There is a pressing need to address the underdevelopment of freight transport services affecting many countries. Freight transport tends to be characterised by poor service, prohibitive costs, archaic procedures and constant strikes."
"This all means that timetables are not kept to. In this respect, the prospect of the appropriately staged liberalisation of services could provide a salutary incentive for national reforms, provided that the highest safety standards are upheld and that the existing quality of passenger services is not compromised."
"It is necessary, however, to distinguish clearly between freight and passenger services. In many Member States passenger rail services are instrumental in national and regional development."
"They also have public service responsibilities, which must not be sacrificed to hasty liberalisation. A trend is emerging in certain railway companies."
"They are also neglecting the equipment and networks providing important links between regions in order to concentrate solely on the most lucrative lines. It is important to ensure that premature liberalisation does not make this situation worse instead of better."
"We must ensure that this decline is not accelerated instead of remedied. Premature liberalisation entails the risk of creating areas totally bereft of rail services and of aggravating regional inequalities."
"We will therefore support the common position of the Council. This provides for access rights for passenger transport services to be addressed within the framework of the third rail package."
"Madam President, this work will be based on the conclusions drawn from a careful assessment of the first stage of the process. In this assessment, particular attention should be paid to safety, market share and rail freight volumes, the status of companies and employees’ working conditions."
"Madam President, let me begin by congratulating all the rapporteurs on their very hard work over a very long period of time."
"It has been very important because the maintenance, safety and development of our railway system throughout Europe have to be encouraged and not discouraged."
"Liberalisation is certainly inevitable; it has got to come."
"Traffic has to come off the roads."
"Taking traffic straight off roads and on to the railway can only be good for the future."
"The development of high-speed trains has to be welcomed; it should not be stopped."
"Where I come from – and I am going to be parochial for a little while – we are lucky to have any rail links left at all."
"We have the Belfast to Dublin rail link, but we have hardly any rail links left in Northern Ireland."
"TGV is not an option for us."
"We are lucky to have even ordinary railway links."
"Indeed, they are even trying to close the important link between Belfast and the port of Larne."
"I just do not understand this."
"At a time when we are going towards rail, here are people in my region trying to close down railways!"
"This line has been allowed to run down into poor condition; its safety is questionable and the rolling stock is a disgrace."
"It is not a solution simply to put more traffic and freight on to our roads."
"This is a part of our problem."
"While Northern Ireland may be a very small place compared to other European areas, we need and require railways in Northern Ireland as well."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs. I believe most if not all of those present here today agree that the rapporteurs have done excellent work."
"They are still requesting greater speed in certain areas, and calling for approaches more in line with what we require. I should like to start by saying it is essential to take account of four variables if the vital importance of the subject we are concerned with today is to be properly recognised and assessed."
"The first is the serious situation European transport finds itself in at present, bearing in mind too the forecasts provided by all the studies received."
"In no way can this be a measured legislative process. On the contrary, essential urgent legislation is called for."
"The second is the European variable as presented by the Commissioner."
"It is crucial to the rationalisation of European transport."
"Whatever its heritage, no State can attempt to resolve its transport problems without reference to this splendid and vitally important European variable."
"This variable is essential. There needs to be a holistic European approach to transport problems."
"Thirdly, nothing other than an integrated analysis is appropriate. It is essential to understand the situation of each of the forms of transport."
"They all need to be involved in the solution. Railway transport is in a critical position in the context of the other forms of transport."
"Lastly, each individual form of transport is not important in itself. What is actually important is interoperability between them."
"I trust rail transport will receive a new lease of life thanks to these reports and proposals. Unfortunately, although to date directives have operated efficiently in Europe, trains have not."
"It should be stated unambiguously that our current mission is to save the railways. That is what we are about."
"As Mr Simpson clearly stated, the railways are in decline. Parliament hopes to reinvigorate and strengthen them and get them back on track."
"Liberalisation is the only way to do so. The time for monopolies is past."
"In a monopoly, the railway waits for freight to arrive on its doorstep. The employees sit tight in their offices."
"That is how monopolies operate. By contrast, orderly, appropriate and socially responsible liberalisation involves going out to companies and local authorities in search of freight."
"I therefore believe that safety should be the only consideration governing the deadlines. No other reason is sufficiently powerful to be allowed to delay liberalisation of the railways."
"Delays could be tolerated in the interests of safety. Safety must never be used as a pretext for artificially delaying the entry into service of the various sections, however."
"Commissioner, these reports will highlight the importance of finance and bring it to the attention of all concerned."
"The railways need finance. There are no adequate budget lines for the purpose."
"Parliament proposed setting up a European transport fund. This proposal should be developed further in the next financial perspective."
"Safety is certainly the crucial factor where the railways are concerned."
"I would venture to remind you also, Commissioner, that road safety is another area of concern for us. We would welcome an initiative by you to ensure that the European Road Safety Agency is presented at the earliest opportunity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Jarzembowski report emphasises the importance of faster development of freight rail networks, giving particular consideration to cross-border issues."
"In this context, I would like to draw your attention to the untenable situation of the Italian railway line between Savona and the border with France; a rail link connecting western Liguria with the Cote d’Azur."
"This single track – I repeat, single track – line is a bottleneck for freight and passenger rail traffic, causing substantial damage to the economy of the area, which is dependent on tourism, olive-growing as well as the production of flowers and fruit and vegetables."
"The single track also increases safety risks and such a shortfall in the rail system has repercussions on road traffic, with serious congestion problems and pollution in an area that is heavily geared towards tourism."
"There has been talk of laying a second track since the 1950s, when I was still a small boy."
"Since then, the situation has not changed and increases in the volume of traffic make it even more critical, almost unsustainable, due to the continual delays that are building up and also affecting the adjoining French section of the line."
"Relatively recent works have moved further inland some sections of the railway line – also single track – that runs right along the coast and is therefore subject to coastal erosion."
"This has worsened the state of affairs because it has caused further bottlenecks."
"I will conclude with the hope that, as part of revitalising the international networks in the European Union, a speedy solution will be found by 1 January 2006, the date set for opening the rail networks to all types of rail freight services."
"Madam President, I shall not get into the argument between the European Parliament and the Council about the pace at which rail transport is being liberalised, because, for everyone concerned, the objectives are the same, namely to turn Europe’s railways into a commodity providing large profits for predatory capitalist businesses such as BASF, Ikea and Connex, which is a subsidiary of Vivendi."
"Far from learning the lessons of the liberalisation in Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere, the reports by Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Sterckx in fact propose only that liberalisation be speeded up and made the norm."
"Not only international and national freight but also passenger traffic is from now on to be exposed to the laws of the jungle prevailing in the market."
"The proposed standardisation will take place only on the basis of the lowest common denominator, to the detriment of high safety standards and in such a way as to encourage social dumping, as in the case of road transport."
"This ultra-liberal position must therefore be rejected."
"To adopt it would be, on a long-term basis, to turn our backs on the prospect of putting in place a European public rail transport service."
"As an MEP, I shall not wait for the next disasters to be announced before joining forces at European level with rail users and railway staff to thwart these trends."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, thank you for the work you have done."
"I should mainly like to focus on the development of rail transport rather than safety, interoperability and suchlike."
"In the first instance, these seem to me to be excellent reports."
"The importance of this development of the railways to the environment and to safety is of course abundantly clear."
"The first rail package was aimed at opening up freight transport, particularly internationally, and set a specific date."
"We fought hard for that, and we actually agreed at the time that we would keep our hands off passenger rail transport until there was a separate document about it."
"In my opinion, Parliament is going two steps too far: firstly, in going ahead and talking about liberalisation of countries at internal level, and, secondly, as regards the liberalisation of passenger transport, in particular."
"If this is a lever for negotiations, I can understand it."
"In my view, however, we should drop it immediately and wait until the Commission makes a proposal following a detailed evaluation of the situation in a number of countries, particularly in the UK (privatisation), the Netherlands and several other countries. These are experiencing great problems as a result of splitting up companies."
"It already starts with deregulation; it already starts with the division of companies."
"As an industrial engineer, with knowledge of the way companies should be organised, I say that it is necessary to keep a firm hold on the maintenance of materials and other things, for example."
"We should go back to that."
"We should have an evaluation first, and then a debate on how to proceed with this kind of liberalisation."
"I wholeheartedly support the position of the Council in this connection."
"Madam President, the proposal before us is to complete the liberalisation of rail freight services, increasing competition in those Member States that have yet to liberalise their markets."
"In principle, some might view this as a positive development, since it could provide the UK with new market opportunities in other Member States."
"However, even my limited experience has taught me to be cynical."
"Whereas the UK market is largely open, according to single market principles, regrettably the same cannot be said for many other Member States."
"France, Belgium and Luxembourg remain solidly against completing freight liberalisation."
"The safety directive has introduced a European Railway Agency so that all national safety regulations henceforth can only be introduced by prior consultation and notification to the Commission, thus enabling the Commission to examine draft national rules and question them if it wants."
"So out of the window goes any possibility of introducing urgent Member States' legislation if national rail safety so requires."
"This, in my view, is yet another example of the nanny super-state, where Brussels supposedly knows best."
"Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs on the substantive, good work that they have done."
"The rail package makes a contribution to the liberalisation and modernisation of rail transport in Europe, even though work on this is not yet finished."
"New EU rules provide the railway sector with a new framework. Nevertheless, this sector needs to develop its own economic strength if it is to contribute to solving Europe’s traffic and transport problems."
"If it does not, other modes of transport will finish the job."
"The railways can still learn a good deal from them."
"First of all, I should like to express my opinion on the report by Mr Jarzembowski about the development of the rail network."
"In so doing I should like to thank him personally once more for his work as a rapporteur."
"He deserves praise for striving for the complete liberalisation of freight transport by 2006."
"In view of the comparatively international nature of this mode of transport, it is a logical development that this market be opened up quickly."
"As regards the European railway sector, there is still no genuine internal market in spite of efforts in the context of the common transport policy."
"The railways directive has not led to a complete opening-up of the market."
"The railways are still unable to compete with road, water and air transport in many cases."
"The amendment of the Directive on the development of the Community’s railways would, in my view, contribute to a positive development in this regard."
"In addition, there must above all be a change in attitude in the sector itself, too."
"The present rail package holds out the possibility of a genuine European rail transport market."
"For example, granting what are known as ‘authorised applicants’ (consignors and forwarders) the right to use the services of the railways is a step in the right direction towards a more efficient use of the infrastructure."
"The recent reports of forthcoming cooperation between the German, French and Italian operators of high-speed trains on the construction of train units are a signal that European cooperation is getting up steam; and now on electricity, too."
"The momentum currently existing with regard to the rail package is not unconditional, however."
"The European Council makes a more definite distinction than the European Parliament here between the liberalisation of freight transport on the one hand, and the liberalisation of passenger transport on the other."
"In my opinion, the liberalisation of freight transport is more important than that of passenger transport at this time."
"The liberalisation of freight transport must not fall victim to fighting between Parliament and Council on this matter."
"It is of the utmost importance that we have a complete rail package by the end of the year."
"I also hold the report by Mr Sterckx in high regard."
"Maintaining high safety standards, whilst preventing the protection of abuses on our own market, is a good combination of priorities."
"I also agree with the reports by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Savary."
"Madam President, the debate is very much centred on the notion of Europe being a continent."
"So far, we have ignored the reality that there are some parts of Europe that are not connected by a land bridge or indeed rail tunnel."
"I come from one of those islands, the island of Ireland that does not have a tunnel connecting the rest of Europe, or indeed a land bridge."
"Much of the debate, therefore, about opening up rail links and so forth to some extent goes over our heads."
"Having said that, we have a population of 4 million people, and we export 90% of our production."
"We need good internal links between our major urban centres, and we need good links to our major ports so that our goods can be shipped out effectively and efficiently."
"For that reason, I am quite keen on the idea the Commission recently mentioned – and perhaps the Commissioner might listen to what I have to say – in relation to 'motorways of the sea'."
"This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold."
"The other point I want to make is that rail internally, both on the continent of Europe and in Ireland, is important as a public service."
"It is not going to be possible to ensure the free and fast flow of goods and people around the continent, or indeed on the island of Ireland, unless we have fast, efficient, safe and comfortable rail services, not only to and from our major urban centres, but also to provide cohesion in those parts of our continent whether there is underdevelopment."
"The major financiers who would be interested in cherrypicking the key commuter belt rail services are not interested in providing rail services in the western corridor of the island of Ireland, for instance."
"But that is essential if we are going to provide any kind of proper spatial development to ensure that the population does not drift entirely to the eastern coast."
"These are aspects that need to be addressed."
"This is why I am quite keen on the idea of the European Rail Agency proposed in the Savary report, because there are a lot of other aspects in this rail debate which need to be addressed, both in terms of the commercial life of Europe, but also its spatial development and the development of cohesion."
"That, after all, is an objective of the Lisbon process."
"Madam President, by adopting the Jarzembowski report, Parliament, in collusion with the Council, would be pursuing its policy of demolishing the public service status of the vital sector that is rail transport."
"In the majority of European countries, the rail infrastructure has in large part been put in place with state money, that is to say with taxpayers’ money."
"Now that this infrastructure exists, a horde of private businesses is hurling itself upon this sector so as to be able to derive profit from it."
"Apart from the fact that it is a case of fraud and of collective funds being misappropriated and directed towards private groups, it also constitutes a danger for the future."
"The British experience has shown that, in order to increase their profits, private companies cut back on staff and make savings on infrastructure and maintenance, so putting passenger safety seriously at risk."
"This also leads to stations being closed and unprofitable lines being done away with, even if they are essential to the population to which they provide a service and which then has no choice but to use the roads."
"We reiterate our total opposition to the privatisations and to competition in rail transport."
"Public transport must remain a public service, the objective of which is to provide the best possible service to our populations."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in the realm of rail transport will not be solved by liberalisation but only by removing the obstacles to fair competition that are stacked up against the railways."
"We urgently need an end to social dumping."
"It is a scandal that the Italian Presidency of the Council is not putting the Markov report on its agenda."
"It is a scandal that road and air carriers are still not required to foot the bill for the social costs of their respective transport operations; we need an internalising mechanism along the lines of the Swiss model."
"The great demise of the railways, incidentally, is not confined to freight traffic."
"Are you aware that even a privately operated passenger service such as the Thalys high-speed link between Paris and Brussels is not profitable?"
"In fact, all European passenger lines are running at a loss today, and liberalisation will not change that."
"In other words, we need less ideology and more political action; we need investments in the infrastructure, financial compensation for anti-rail dumping on the basis of the model we have in the domain of renewable sources of energy, where we subsidise losses to compensate for the fact that producers of energy from non-renewable sources do not pay for their environmental impact, and, thirdly, an end to social dumping."
"– Madam President, the European Union has once again shown its support, in this joint debate on the second rail package, for the liberalisation of the railways in order to promote greater competition in this crisis-ridden sector."
"In this context, I feel that rapid liberalisation of the rail sector in all the Member States would favour this mode of transport as a credible alternative to rail and road transport, and as a means of combating the explosion in these sectors, which have disastrous effects on the environment and on regional planning."
"To my mind, this liberalisation can only be understood in the broad sense of greater competition in both the freight and passenger transport sectors, at both national and international levels."
"This liberalisation will mean that any Community rail transport company will have fair and equal access to infrastructure in all the Member States for commercial ends."
"As I have already had occasion to emphasise, however, we need to fight against a very widely-held prejudice: liberalising rail transport does not mean that safety standards cannot be stepped up."
"This rail package actually enables safety regulations to be toughened, in particular by harmonising working times and rest periods for train drivers and other train staff performing safety tasks."
"Since technology enables extremely high levels of safety, there is no good reason why legislators should be content to pass laws providing less protection for passengers."
"For instance, installing black boxes on trains is another safety measure that I completely endorse."
"Since these devices have proved to have clear benefits in the air and road sectors, in lorries and on buses, I cannot conceive of any justification for not applying the same technology on the railways."
"I insist that safety must have top priority, and would also like to express my support for the establishment of a European Railway Agency, which would permit a higher degree of interoperability and safety of the various trans-European networks."
"I cannot end this speech without levelling some harsh criticism at the EU’s new priority projects scheme, known as the Quick-Start Programme."
"With a view to stimulating economic growth in Europe through large-scale projects, the Commission has drawn up a list of 13 initiatives, seven of them linked to rail transport."
"It is regrettable that the list only benefits transport networks in the centre of the European Union, failing to include the Iberian TGV links between Lisbon and Madrid."
"Madam President, Commissioner, although it breaks with customary rail practice in Europe, we have accepted the idea of dividing the use of the railways between, on the one hand, those who run the rail network and, on the other, those who use the railways for transport purposes."
"We have accepted this as a worthwhile experiment, partly because it is not beyond the bounds of possibility – although this is by no means proven – that it will help increase the amount of goods transported, and partly because it will enable a more detailed comparison to be made between rail and road transport, with the latter having, from the start, been familiar with the dual approach being introduced by the Community to the railways."
"The same reasons have led us to oppose the ceaseless efforts on the part of the right to anticipate the possible parameters of passenger transport, the Commission’s proposal, the current wishes of the Council of Ministers and, above all, the Commission’s evaluation of experience, included by Parliament at first reading in the draft directive."
"This constant push on the part of the right towards anticipating liberalisation demonstrates what we have persisted in saying, namely that, for many, liberalisation is only a back door to privatisation."
"We have voted against such anticipation by rejecting Mr Jarzembowski’s report, and we shall continue to do so."
"In spite of the many and varied efforts made by Mr Sterckx, we have also voted against his report on safety."
"In spite of many major improvements, emphasised by my colleague Mr Savary, Mr Sterckx’ report does in fact ratify what has been accepted by the Council of Ministers, namely the subordination of safety to profitability."
"The fact that Europe – a little, a lot or passionately, depending upon the circumstances – contributes to making safety dependent upon profitability, even though experience clearly shows that liberalisation, by its nature, increases the risks, says a lot about the wayward liberal approach to European integration."
"Acceptance of this notion is all the more dangerous in as much as, once it has taken root in the railway sector, it will spread like a cancer to the other means of transport."
"For this reason, among others, my colleagues and I shall therefore also continue to oppose Mr Sterckx’ report."
"Madam President, I do not need to emphasise the importance of the vote on this second railway package and, above all, the importance of guaranteeing that this package is also soon adopted by the Council."
"We all believe that we need to work to ensure that there is the necessary shift of demand for and burden on certain means of transport, road and air in particular, to avoid congestion and problems caused by excessive use, and subsequent overloading."
"It is, to some extent, a question of moving from intentions to facts and to specific proposals, guaranteeing competitive prices, safety, reliability and, above all, the provision of the infrastructure and the investment needed to optimise the available alternatives, beginning with the railways."
"Although it is necessary, I must honestly admit that I never thought that the opening up of the market and the processes of liberalisation would, in themselves, be the sole answer, a kind of a shortcut to a miracle."
"They have to be subject to certain conditions: if we remove ideological pretexts and inflexibility, then we must recognise that they can help and facilitate these processes."
"On certain conditions, of course: without a doubt, all aspects of safety, professionalism and the social protection that have to be provided for in the processes of opening up the markets and competition, are indispensable, precisely to avoid competition being achieved to the detriment of these factors and guarantees; in the same way, it is also necessary to increase the provision of universal services and services of public interest in order, once again, to prevent competition from concentrating investment and management interests solely in strong market areas where demand is high, disregarding the situations where the supply of services is crucial, rather, for encouraging and driving forward development processes, in other words to respond to what are actually inalienable needs for both freight and passenger transport services."
"Subject to these conditions, there must be fixed deadlines for liberalisation, although not too short, because it is only under these conditions that it is possible to guarantee private resources are contributed to infrastructure investment projects."
"Otherwise, they could be destined to be delayed because of the chronic difficulties that we have, as we know, in raising the necessary public funds to complete these processes."
"We need to guarantee the principle of reciprocity in this context, as stated in the amendments tabled before Parliament, because we believe that this will avoid distortion of the market, which has already occurred in other liberalisation processes."
"I hope that adequate solutions can be found which take into consideration these principles and choices in our negotiations with the Council too."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we speak of the railways, we are compelled to refer time and again to the relationship between service provision and liberalisation."
"I must once more express my regret that we in Parliament have never managed to engage in a comprehensive discussion of this subject instead of focusing our deliberations on one mode of transport at a time, on the basis of the project under consideration."
"Had we been able to have such a discussion, I believe we could have broken down certain prejudices that rear their heads in every debate."
"As I see it, liberalisation is something that can only take place – and road transport, I believe, illustrates this very well – if we accompany it with supporting regulatory measures."
"These measures relate to safety, working conditions, the right to practise a trade and other factors, including technical interoperability."
"It is our task to make this happen, and what we have on the table today is, in my opinion, a considerable step forward which will enable us to discuss not only the liberalisation of rail transport but also accompanying measures that will meet the requirements to which I have referred."
"Must liberalisation mean social dumping?"
"Not in my view."
"Does it have to result in job losses?"
"Again, the answer is no."
"And does liberalisation mean less safety?"
"Not at all, as I believe is very clearly illustrated in Mr Sterckx’s report ."
"Britain is not a good example for us, and no one in this House would want to follow it."
"What we have tabled here relates to the very thing that was not done in Britain, namely proper preparation of the liberalisation process."
"And let me say to the Members from Belgium and France that jobs are already being lost at the present time."
"In my own country of Belgium, for example, the railways’ share of the transport markets is falling; in ten years the number of private sidings has fallen to a third of its former level; this means that the rail industry has not furnished proof of its efficiency, and as a result of this it has been gradually shedding jobs."
"Anyone who warns us that jobs will be lost and forgets that they are already being lost now, when the railways are still in the public sector, has not, to my mind, assessed the situation fairly and objectively."
"We have to grasp the nettle in our own countries too and acknowledge that our governments have been underfunding the railways and that we have not provided our rail operators with the resources they would need to organise tomorrow’s large-scale rail network."
"We must also recognise that the wage bills these institutions have to meet are far too high and that national governments must intervene here too in the first instance."
"I have no wish to become obsessed with dates, but I should like to point out that it would be bad for the railways and for our countries if we in this House did not set any deadlines, because we are convinced that tomorrow’s transport map will cover the whole of Europe, and this development must not be stopped in its tracks by special measures and special rules in the small countries."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteurs and the entire committee for their work."
"The harmonisation and liberalisation of rail transport in the EU is an important step towards the aims of transferring more transport from road to rail and creating an integrated intermodal transport system."
"In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, it is essential that the trans-European network projects affecting the eastern part of Austria should actually be implemented on schedule."
"This infrastructure is needed to preserve the quality of life enjoyed by the population of those areas and to ensure that they remain favourably disposed to enlargement."
"These are normal projects, relating to the rail and road networks and the Danube improvement scheme."
"One word on a topical issue: we all know that every Member State has its own particular set of circumstances and its own problems."
"May I therefore appeal again today to all those involved in the ecopoints negotiations to work out a compromise that is acceptable to all parties."
". Madam President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members who took the floor for their contributions. A number of different approaches were put forward."
"Everyone seems to agree, however, that this is the last opportunity to give a real boost to the rail sector. It is the last chance to make rail a competitive form of transport in the twenty-first century."
"It is being completed today by means of this second rail package. The next challenge will be to make rail a genuine alternative form of passenger transport also."
"We totally agree that a number of actors will emerge once the railways are fully integrated in the field, when a European railway network is in place and geographical integration a reality."
"Competition will then come about. This will result in better services, prices and quality and increased competitiveness."
"Funds are required to carry out the necessary technological changes in the years to come. These changes will secure the existence of a Trans-European network transcending current borders."
"In this connection I should point out that new proposals for amendments to the regulation give priority to this factor with regard to the Trans-European networks. You will nonetheless be aware that in the context of the financial perspective after 2007, I am proposing an eight or nine-fold increase of the funds allocated to these networks."
"I am actually proposing that in excess of EUR 4 000 million be set aside for this purpose each year. The rail sector will certainly be a priority then, along with the accomplishment of a Trans-European railway network, or to put it in other words, interoperability."
"We will be presenting the third rail package for passenger transport. In addition though, we shall deal with the whole issue of qualifications, as I mentioned earlier."
"It is important to maintain and build on this tradition. Indeed, it should be developed further and common criteria shared across the European network."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the House already helped to ensure the survival of the railways by supporting the first rail package. This second rail package will allow Parliament to make a further contribution to ensuring that our railways do not end up as relics of the past."
"Thank you, Mrs de Palacio."
"Madam President, I wanted to say this a minute ago, during the debate, straight after Mr Dillen’s speech. In it, he made a passionate plea for the ‘Iron Rhine’ railway connection between the port of Antwerp and the Ruhr area."
"I wanted to point out that, when, a year or 18 months ago, we discussed a Commission proposal to extend the TEN projects – a proposal which did not make it through in the end, and which has now been replaced by a new one – I tabled an amendment to include the Iron Rhine as a matter of priority."
"I just wanted to put on the record that Mr Dillen’s predecessors abstained on that proposal back then."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, one undoubted reason why Members are so attentive is that they know that this report deals, among other things, with Eurostat, though not with the secret bank accounts but with the quite respectable matter of a proposal for a regulation which would require the Member States to submit quarterly data to Eurostat concerning financial transactions and financial assets and liabilities for all units classified in the general government sector."
"The proposal regulates the compilation and characteristics of quarterly data on each Member State’s financing expenses and the timetable for their transmission."
"In the context of the Stability and Growth Pact, these are crucial data, because they are the basis of a stable euro."
"In the budgetary situation in which several Member States find themselves at the present time and in view of chronic deficits in excess of the 3% ceiling, these data assume even greater importance as a means of accurately measuring the extent of the problems with a view to taking appropriate remedial action."
"The French, the Germans and others are already all too familiar with this situation."
"My report contains an amendment with which we seek to alter two points in the Commission’s proposal."
"First of all, the deadline for the transmission of quarterly data for the central government, state government, local government and social security funds subsectors is shifted from 30 June to 31 December of this year."
"This is logical, because June 2003 is now in the past."
"Secondly, the Commission is to be given the right to grant a derogation, not exceeding two years, for the starting date of transmission of these data in exceptional cases."
"This extension was requested in the Council by various Member States, and particularly by the countries that will be acceding to the Union next year, since these States would find it difficult, pending adaptation of their national statistical systems, to deliver reliable data on time."
"Such an extension, however, is without prejudice to the aim of full transmission of all data by 30 June 2005."
"I move that this amendment be adopted, so that we can dispense with a second reading of this proposal for a regulation, otherwise the regulation, which is already overdue, could not enter into force in good time."
"There is, of course, the possibility that some people here might prefer to continue working with nebulous data in order to conceal their country’s true financial position."
"Nevertheless, the Italians would be delighted if they could add this to the list of regulations that have been adopted under their presidency."
"– Thank you for that very clear presentation, Mrs Lulling, we now know what we are voting on."
"We now continue with the vote."
"– That concludes the vote."
". This regulation seeks to impose on the Member States a requirement to forward quarterly data concerning financial transactions and financial assets and liabilities in the general government sector."
"The main amendment aims to put back the first transmission of data to 31 December 2003, to allow for the delay in approving this proposal."
"It also ensures a derogation of two years for any government whose ‘national statistical system requires major adaptations’."
"Nevertheless, this regulation is clearly part and parcel of the guiding philosophy of the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999. That philosophy seeks to gather statistical information in order to ascertain the best way of controlling and coordinating economic policies, a concept linked, over and above economic and monetary union (EMU), to the issue of the Stability Pact."
"In itself, however, having more statistical information is no bad thing."
"The way such information is gathered or used might be."
"Mr Purvis’s report has the virtue of gently putting an end to exceptional arrangements for Corsica, which there is nothing to justify."
"The French Government cannot, at one and the same time, conduct a merciless anti-smoking campaign and ask for the prolongation, in Corsica, of a privilege that helps promote nicotine addiction, particularly among young people."
"Nor do metropolitan tobacconists understand this schizophrenic attitude at a time when they are having serious difficulties surviving."
"In seeking to save 53 jobs, the French Government is making itself a party to the serious consequences of tobacco for our fellow citizens’ health."
"It is making itself guilty of the failure to assist those whom it has a duty to protect."
"That is why I shall vote in favour of Mr Purvis’s report."
"Part of a new initiative by the French Government, aimed at improving local economic development, the Commission proposal authorising France to prolong the application of lower rates of excise duty to tobacco products released for consumption in Corsica is by no means a privilege accorded to this French administrative department, a department that, unlike the neighbouring islands, no longer benefits, I am sorry to say, from the status of Objective 1 region."
"These specific arrangements, enabling the additional costs of cigarette production on the island to be offset, are, in reality, a response to the pressing need to safeguard a sector of activity that generates a lot of jobs."
"Indeed, tobacco products are retailed in Corsica by some 350 retailers employing an equivalent number of staff."
"Suddenly bringing the tax applied in Corsica into line with that in force on the continent would force half of the retailers on the island purely and simply to cease their activities."
"That is why I shall not follow the rapporteur who, in only taking account of the interests of the internal market and in deliberately ignoring the problems linked to island status, is proposing tax arrangements totally inappropriate to the situation."
". – On the whole, I support the derogations that are being put to the vote in favour of the so-called ‘outermost regions’."
"These derogations are justified on account of the endeavour to give those islands a starting position that is more comparable to the mainland, by compensating them for the inevitably higher costs of transport over long distances to the centre of the State of which they form part."
"That kind of derogation does not apply in this case."
"What is necessary to protect the Azores or Martinique is much less relevant in the case of Corsica, which is less remote."
"Cigarettes are produced on that island and the price is kept down for local consumers and tourists."
"The 32% tax is nearly half the rate applied in France, and also lower than the 57% minimum rate laid down for the EU as a whole."
"This derogation is a remnant from the regime of the Emperor Napoleon I – who hailed from that island – from 1811."
"Continuing this derogation until the end of 2009 is not in the interests of public health."
"I certainly do not begrudge the inhabitants of Corsica, who speak a language other than French, greater autonomy and even the right of secession, but I am not willing to buy their favour by keeping the price of an unhealthy stimulant artificially low."
". I voted against this report, even though I understand its aim of prolonging the application of a lower rate of excise duty on tobacco products released in Corsica."
"I voted simply on a point of procedure: I believe that the European Commission’s original proposal should have been considered first, since it is, of course, the result of proper deliberations in the course of negotiations with local businesspeople and representatives of the sector."
"I feel that, as in other cases such as this, the specific requirements of the tobacco industry in the area in question – Corsica, in this case – should be taken into account, without losing sight of the general principles as a result."
"The rapporteur’s proposal to initiate a gradual phasing out of the derogation scheme, in order to arrive at the same result by 2010, may theoretically seem reasonable, in terms of effectiveness. It would, however, conflict with the principle of allowing local industry a period of time because it is less competitive due to its production costs, which have been proved to be higher."
"Mr President, I should like firstly to express my pleasure at the fact that, after a long fight and a long journey, we have finally been able to make reason prevail and have saved the budget line relating to the prevention and combating of forest fires."
"Following the summer of fires that we have experienced, particularly in Portugal, I think it would have been the last straw – and no doubt a disgrace – if the European Parliament had not shown its solidarity with all of Europe’s foresters who are subject to these risks of fire."
"I should like therefore to thank all of our fellow MEPs."
"Unfortunately, there was no way around these disasters or of avoiding a resolution by voting in favour of which all MEPs have agreed to join with the representatives of the Southern countries with a view to saving this budget line."
"I hope that, beyond 2006, we shall be able to have a still more generous policy, for these EUR 9 million – although not to be sneezed at, especially when these credits are underconsumed – are probably not enough, given the formidable challenge of preventing fires in the Mediterranean forests and in those of southern Europe."
"We chose to vote in favour of compromise Amendments Nos 22 to 33 in the report concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus)."
"We are extremely hesitant about increasing the contribution of Community policy to forestry."
"We believe that the basic conditions within the EU are so different that it is questionable what added value such a Community policy would have."
"Nor should we ideally like to see fire prevention measures mentioned at all in this regulation, since such measures are out of place in this environmental monitoring programme."
"Moreover, they would be in danger of stealing a lot of resources from other monitoring areas."
"Fire prevention is instead a part of the EU regulation on rural development and should remain so in the future."
"The EU has no competence in the area of forestry policy."
"In spite of this, the programme adopted by the European Parliament means that the monitoring of forestry, biodiversity and forest fires is being centralised."
"We Moderates do not accept that the EU should be given competence for forestry policy by the back door."
"European forests cannot be compared with each other."
"Sweden and Finland at present account for 40% of EU forest production."
"In Sweden and Finland, forestry is the most important industry economically and cannot be a European matter."
"In these countries, we have a long tradition of looking after our forests in an economically and ecologically sustainable way."
"Our forests do not present the same biodiversity as the forests in southern Europe."
"That has to do with the natural basic conditions, because the climate is colder."
"We do not believe that there is any reason for centralising forestry."
"We are, however, able to support fire prevention activity."
"Unlike air and water, forests are not a cross-border issue."
"We Moderates will continue to protect the forests of Sweden."
"We have voted against the current report."
"We do not believe that a forestry policy needs to be developed at EU level."
"Issues concerning forest fires and how to fund the fighting of such fires are best dealt with at national level or through direct cooperation between the Member States affected."
". It is unfortunate that the compromise adopted on forest fire prevention and financing for the Forest Focus programme did not live up to the rapporteur’s original proposals, which we supported."
"Now, after the vote in plenary, the compromise has diminished the overall report, which contained deeper and more wide-ranging amendments on monitoring and developing forest fire prevention measures."
"As we know, the aim of the compromise adopted is to ensure fruitful negotiations with the Commission and the Council, but the fact is that the funding for the programme has now been slashed by EUR 6 million, whereas an increase of EUR 15 million was originally proposed."
"It is also unfortunate that the financing of prevention measures has fallen below the levels required and has no clear mandate."
"Bearing in mind the disaster of the summer’s forest fires and the need to ensure that there is enough funding to preserve the forest legacy of the European Union, the reservations of the Council and of some national groupings within the European Parliament are incomprehensible."
"This compromise is a far cry from the position adopted by the European Parliament in its resolution of 4 September 2003, on the effects of the summer heat wave."
"Fires have ravaged the dry regions of Spain, Portugal and the South of France, which have been the victims of this summer’s extremely low rainfall."
"Other regions, such as the Vosges, have also been victims of the heatwave."
"I am therefore in favour of including fire prevention in Forest Focus, even if, in my opinion, the best firefighting tool is still the regulation on sustainable development."
"An entire section of the regulation deals with forestry, involving an annual subsidy of EUR 450 million."
"In comparison, the Forest Focus budget seems very low. Following the COREPER compromise, only EUR 61 million have been allocated over four years to fund actions in the fifteen Member States."
"Spread as thinly as that, this sum will not be very effective in preventing fires."
"That will be all the more the case, given that measures designed to promote the harmonised collection, processing and validation of data and to improve the understanding of forests are to be added to fire prevention."
"Forest Focus should, in my view, not replace or compete with the regulation on sustainable development but supplement it by providing for the gathering of data on forests."
"In conclusion, the question arises as to the appropriateness of bestowing new remits upon a regulation that is already underfunded and overburdened."
"Are we really focusing on our forests?"
". The main question posed during the debate was this: should fire prevention be covered under the regulation on rural development, or should it be reintroduced into Forest Focus?"
"Fire prevention had actually been incorporated into the regulation on rural development in 1999 (see the chapter on forestry)."
"Our group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, rightly supports the rapporteur’s desire to include fire-fighting and fire prevention under the umbrella of Forest Focus, and to increase the relevant budget significantly."
"Although some Member States, especially in northern Europe, where the climatic conditions largely preclude the fire problem, have indicated their opposition to this reinsertion, the horrifying spectacle of last summer’s fires imposes on Members the duty of voting for this increase in appropriations and for a ‘fire capacity’."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report, which I feel is a satisfactory compromise, further assisted by the amendments tabled to it and adopted."
"Today’s vote was the culmination of a lengthy Parliamentary process. That process began at first reading, which took place in February."
"Once again, I would like to congratulate (and thank) Mrs Redondo Jiménez for her excellent and tireless work."
"I also welcome the great progress made in the positions of the Council and the Commission, progress which has allowed us to achieve a satisfactory compromise based on draft amendments supported by my group, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, among others."
"Those draft amendments will leave their mark on the final text of the regulation. Recalling the issues we have fought for hardest in the process of adopting this Forest Focus programme, they are: greater budgetary openness, respect for the principle of subsidiarity, and above all inclusion of the line on forest fire prevention."
"It would, of course, be incomprehensible if, after so many years of positive steps under the previous regulation, Forest Focus were now to neglect the field of forest fire prevention."
"More than that, in fact, it would be totally intolerable, given the striking lessons imparted anew last summer by yet another ruinous disaster."
"I wanted this regulation to go further, but, all things considered, and taking into account the need to avoid wasting the whole of 2003 on the delays and uncertainties of a conciliation procedure, I welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission have heeded Parliament’s reiterated demands in the most important areas."
"I have voted against the report because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the EU really does not have, or should not have, its own forestry policy."
"The purpose of the report is, therefore, in the first place to appropriate EU funds (EUR 67 million or slightly more than SEK 600 million) to Portugal and Spain in connection with the forest fires by which these countries are often hit."
"That is certainly a lawful aim, but it is scarcely a European matter to provide economic aid in relation to forest fires generally."
"The Redondo Jiménez report provides a precise account of the state of our forests but does not, unfortunately, propose practical solutions either for protecting them or for ensuring that they are monitored."
"As an elected representative of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region, I was appalled by the forest fires which, this summer, destroyed more than 60 000 hectares of land in France, mainly in the Var and Haute-Corse administrative departments."
"It turns out that the vast majority of these fires are of criminal origin."
"Penal sanctions against the arsonists and those behind such acts should therefore be strengthened."
"Everyone involved, all of whom have also agreed upon the need to step up prevention and to strengthen the protection of forests as a national heritage that we have to administer jointly, wants to see the criminalisation of these acts."
"We also believe that human activities carried on in our forests need to be considered a public service of general interest and that, given their non-profitability, they therefore need to be supported financially."
"Forest owners should also be offered tax breaks and financial incentives to encourage them to clear brushwood and carry out maintenance work."
"‘Private forester-firefighters’ could do this work."
"There we have a genuine environmental policy."
"I should like to conclude by asking a question : will France, like Portugal, be entitled to aid from the new European Solidarity Fund?"
"Mr President, we were in the future and you, Mr President, had become honorary President of the great Pensioner’s Party, which had 30% of the vote across Europe."
"You came up to me, as honorary President, linked arms with me and said: ‘Dear Mr Fatuzzo, you not only have to vote, and I advise you to vote, for Mrs de Sarnez’s report that provides for the Erasmus Mundus masters for cultural exchanges between young people, but you must also propose the foundation of the Fatuzzus Mundus senior masters – I repeat: – so that there can be intercultural exchanges between pensioners, who would dearly love this’."
"Will this remain a dream?"
". Following negotiations with the Council and the Commission, the rapporteur tabled amendments to her recommendation for second reading, in order to ensure that the Erasmus Mundus programme would be equipped to achieve its desired ends."
"This programme is an essential instrument for exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education."
"Any measure enabling it to be effectively implemented, therefore, deserves our support."
"Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses should be synonymous with quality."
"They should, therefore, be selected on the basis of the quality of the training on offer, as well as the hosting provided for students."
"One of the principal objectives of this programme is to promote linguistic diversity."
"While attending a Masters Course, students should have the opportunity to use the languages of at least two of the countries where the institutions involved in these courses are situated."
"The financial framework for implementing the programme is essential to its success."
"The Council agreed on a budget of EUR 180 million."
"This amount, however, is insufficient and that is why we support the request for appropriations totalling EUR 230 million."
"In proposing 250 inter-university European Masters with a quality label (‘Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses’) and with the support of the European Union; in awarding scholarships for 4 200 postgraduate students from third countries; or, again, in offering scholarships for 1 000 scholars invited from third countries to Europe, the stakes have been set high, and the budget should be commensurate with these."
"If, clearly, the budget made available for this new instrument must not in any way put a strain on the budgets for the existing programmes, it remains no less the case that the budgets initially provided for by the Commission (EUR 200 million) and by the Council (EUR 180 million) are far too niggardly to give full scope to this new instrument of exchange and cooperation within the field of higher education."
"Now, the stakes are high. It is, in fact, a question not only of forging closer links between the European universities but also of boosting the competitiveness of higher education provision by making it more attractive to students and teachers in the rest of the world."
"The linguistic stakes cannot be ignored."
"It is a question of emphasising both the importance of the EU’s linguistic diversity and the need for third-country students to know at least two EU languages."
". Although the European Parliament agrees with the Commission on this issue, it wants to increase the budget to EUR 230 million, compared to the Council’s proposal of just EUR 180 million."
"It should be noted that this programme goes beyond the standard Erasmus scheme, since it covers Europe and the rest of the world, as well as Masters and postgraduate courses."
"As we know, the underlying argument proposes to integrate European higher education systems to form a European education market, where postgraduate courses will have a particularly prominent role to play."
"On the other hand, we already know from our experience of other projects, particularly the traditional Erasmus programme, that less well-off students tend to be doubly discriminated against and alienated by these schemes, which fail to reimburse all the costs."
"My point is that the difficulties encountered in increasing the amount of funding for this programme prove that there is no intention of fighting such discrimination and that a set of conditions to which we object is going to be retained."
"What we really need to know is not so much which universities will teach courses like these as who will be taught on them."
"The amounts earmarked for scholarships and to the ‘quality of the hosting provided for students’, already mentioned here, still fall well below what is required in order to broaden the social base from which Erasmus students and teachers are drawn."
"That gives us cause for regret."
". I voted in favour of this report, because I believe that the priorities of a more mutually supportive European Union, one which is genuinely mindful of the needs of the rest of the world, should include enhancing the quality of higher education and promoting intercultural understanding through cooperation between Member States and with third countries."
"To that end, I feel it is crucial both to establish knowledge networks and partnerships which transcend the borders of the European Union, and to award multiple qualifications involving various higher education institutions in different Member States."
"The establishment of ‘Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses’ is hugely important. These courses will set uniform standards of achievements and excellence, with the European Union’s seal of approval."
"The importance of the Union’s linguistic diversity will be reflected in the need for third-country students to be familiar with at least two European Union languages. The proposal to increase the programme’s financial framework so that it can achieve its aims deserves particular support."
"Erasmus Mundus really does offer ‘a new vision of higher education in Europe’, by allowing foreign students to undertake a ‘European tour’. When existing exchange programmes come up for review, it is important that this new dimension of European higher education be taken into account."
"By adopting today a new instrument of exchange and cooperation in the field of higher education, we are sending out a positive signal to students and teachers in third countries in the rest of the world that we are outward-looking and welcoming."
"This Erasmus Mundus programme offers a new vision of higher education in Europe, enabling foreign students to make a ‘tour of Europe’ in two or three different universities, including those entered by competitive examination."
"Thanks to the title, ‘Erasmus Mundus Masters Course’, it will be possible for the training proposed by the European Union easily to be recognised in all countries."
"Students will therefore be guaranteed a warm welcome and high-quality training."
"We must make our higher education attractive."
"The promotion of linguistic ability, before and during the periods spent here by students and academics from third countries, must be strongly encouraged."
"We sincerely hope that the Council will put its weight behind the budget of EUR 230 million proposed for this programme, a budget that should be equal to the ambitions of the latter."
"Indeed, almost 4 000 students from third countries and almost a thousand academics should benefit from this programme between now and 2008."
"In my report on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, I drew attention to the Bologna Declaration of June 1999, to the effect that ‘[t]he vitality and efficiency of any civilisation can be measured by the appeal that its culture has for other countries’."
"I was in Paris Mr President."
"A night at the a cabaret, dance, topless dancers, with feathers as appropriate."
"Fantastic!"
"There, in the middle of these hundred dancers, the only male dancer appeared."
"I looked at him: it was Mr Mauro, who was dancing with the gracefulness of Fred Astaire and was singing with the voice of Frank Sinatra."
"Then, at one point, the music stopped and Mr Mauro, dancer at the turned to me and said: ‘e-twinning of universities: that is what my document will achieve.’"
"Could I vote against this report, Mr President, after Mr Mauro’s exploit?"
". It is to be welcomed that the Council’s common position on the Learning Programme outlined the same priorities as were approved by the European Parliament at first reading."
"The overall budget of EUR 33 million proposed for the programme by the Council, however, is not satisfactory."
"If there are insufficient funds, the successful implementation of the programme will be undermined, and it will be impossible to begin it in good time."
"The sum of EUR 44 million has now been proposed as a minimum appropriation. This amount is reasonable and adequate, bearing in mind the aims we want to achieve."
"The overall aim is to encourage the integration of the new information and communication technologies into European education and training systems, thereby enabling:"
"- greater intercultural dialogue;"
"- awareness of languages;"
"- development of lifelong learning;"
"- exchanges of good practice."
"I voted in favour, since this programme provides the impetus needed to achieve the knowledge-based society to which we aspire."
"We quite obviously want education and training systems to benefit from Information and Communication Technologies and, in short, from everything implied by the European Learning Programme."
"While the European institutions set great store, however, by programmes presented as being at the forefront of progress, the education of working class children, even at elementary level, is in decline everywhere in Europe."
"To take only France as an example, there is an increase in illiteracy and a decline in the ability to speak correctly and to do simple arithmetic."
"The reasons are simple: a shortage of funds and a lack of teachers, teaching assistants and various teaching support staff."
"Governments prefer to shower the employers with subsidies, while reducing the social budgets, including that for state education."
"If high technology is perhaps making a little progress in the classroom, state education is in decline for lack of resources."
"For that reason, a whole generation of children and young people from working class backgrounds and environments is being deprived of the minimum of education, not even to mention an education worthy of the name and commensurate with the wealth of the continent, for, in this area as in all others, it is the working classes who pay the price for the anti-social choices of governments serving only the privileged and affluent classes."
"This report enshrines the plan to pursue and entrench the policy of destructuring both training methods and the means of producing teaching and learning products (which now fall within the multimedia industry’s sphere of competence). This is happening in response to the so-called example gleaned from the experiences and policies of countries that have gone further along the path of privatising schools and of commercialising education."
"There, the companies that provide such goods and services are more experienced and have already accumulated considerable economic weight and cultural influence."
"This report’s support for measures that destructure modes of formal education, and in particular education, comes to the fore at various points."
"These measures combine with the under-funding of educational institutions to help dismantle public education systems. In addition, they pave the way for private organisations to supply informal educational methods such as distance learning, whose value as an educational qualification is meaningless, and also for the contracting of workers trained in such informal ‘education systems’."
"Doubts remain as to the composition of the Commission’s advisory committee, though it will, naturally, include ‘experts’, thereby circumventing governments’ representative authority."
"The rash of programmes such as Learning, Leonardo, Socrates, and so forth, tend to reduce the room for manoeuvre, the authority, of each Member State, each educational institution. These programmes reduce the purpose of education itself to a supporting role, or to being a means to some other end."
"I congratulate Mr Mauro on the legislative resolution on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council decision on a multiannual programme (2004-2006) for the effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in education and training systems in Europe (Learning Programme). I fully support this resolution, particularly regarding the need to encourage the integration of new information and communication technologies in education and training systems in Europe, thereby improving the quality of those systems and access to them."
"I would also like to emphasise that I believe the European Parliament’s efforts to increase the overall budget for this multiannual programme to be totally justified. This is the only way to achieve the programme’s objectives and ambitions."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that social cohesion and intercultural dialogue are among the European Union’s aims. If fostered and achieved, they will allow us to bridge the ‘digital divide’, which stems mainly from a failure to encourage lifelong learning, the speed at which technology is advancing and the economic (and also physical) difficulties of many citizens."
"That European dimension justifies more structured cooperation between Community programmes and instruments on the one hand, and, on the other, the actions of the Member States. I would make one exception, however: such cooperation cannot involve any interference with the freedom of Member States to determine the content of educational programmes, otherwise for dialogue between cultures will be replaced with a single mode of thought."
"The effective enhancement of goods and services, guarantees of effective dissemination and exchanges of good practice are reasons to support the rapporteur’s proposal to amend the quantity of budget appropriations for the multiannual programme, and will also make it possible to promote genuine integration of the new information and communication technologies in education and training systems in Europe."
"I welcome the support given to the creation of European virtual campuses and to the -twinning of European schools. More than political declarations or legal and institutional constructs devised behind the backs of nations and Member States, these measures will assist with the gradual construction of a truly pluralist European spirit."
"It goes without saying that I voted in favour."
"I was on holiday, bathing at the seaside."
"On the beach, I saw Mr Maaten, tanned, a great swimmer and a surfer, but still an MEP and a politician."
"At one point, in fact, he held a meeting, giving a speech to retired swimmers who had rushed in their numbers to hear him."
"He spoke about his directive, he said that he wanted clean waters, and everyone was listening to him."
"I, however, saw that he was glancing towards the sea where there were some beautiful bathers, buxom like the lifeguards in Baywatch, and his eyes were constantly following them."
"Then, I had a doubt: was he not calling for clearer and more transparent waters so that he would be better able to see the beauties that swim in these waters?"
"The suspicion persisted, but still I had to vote for the motion."
"We chose to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 76 and 19 and against, for example, Amendments Nos 5 and 7."
"That is because we believe that the definition of bathing water must be simple and clear and afford as little room for interpretation as possible."
"It is very unsatisfactory for legal certainty that the directive does not contain a simple and clear definition."
"Nor do we believe that an unmanageable number of bathing areas should be covered by the directive."
"Furthermore, we are opposed to extending the scope of the directive to include water activities in addition to bathing."
"That would place unreasonable demands upon the local authorities, which would then also have to take samples in connection with various sports, which might also have much longer seasons than the actual bathing season."
"Finally, we should like to see transitory contamination mentioned in the directive, but with a clear definition of what is meant by transitory contamination, together with a restriction upon the permitted period for such contamination."
"When the outcome of the vote was not as we had wished where these important points were concerned, we chose to vote against the proposal for a directive in the final vote."
"Water quality is an important environmental issue, and it was therefore important and commendable that the EU should have adopted a framework directive on water, 2000/60/EC."
"The framework directive establishes the general framework for protecting all types of water (water in rivers and lakes, together with coastal and groundwater)."
"It is not, however, important that the EU should have a directive regulating the quality of bathing water."
"That is an example of the EU’s being unnecessarily detailed in regulating matters that are not even cross-border in nature."
"We would instead emphasise the autonomy of local authorities and the Member States in this area."
"I abstained from voting on the proposal for a directive concerning the quality of bathing water."
"I do not think that this directive is really necessary, in any case not with such a wealth of detail."
"This is bureaucratic Europe in all its splendour."
"Does not the principle of subsidiarity exist to leave responsibility for the quality of bathing water to the national or regional authorities?"
". – Many in this Parliament believe that the EU should concern itself less with the protection of health at the workplace or with environmental pollution."
"That became clear earlier, in the course of the voting on my proposals regarding substances harmful to health, such as asbestos and solvents in paint."
"EU involvement is limited to exerting pressure for a reduction in the costs of health care, and to implementing the Stability and Growth Pact that is to support the value of the euro."
"Only when I pressed for far-reaching measures to counter the advance of the new disease SARS was there short-lived support for a more active policy."
"Today, we are talking about the quality of bathing water, which, at first glance, is the kind of thing that would only be a matter for municipalities and provinces."
"Now that many people are bathing and swimming in lakes and seas far from home, however, there is good cause to introduce international safety standards."
"It is notable that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is proposing to reject the report on this by the ELDR rapporteur, and thus also, of course, the Directive aimed at protecting the quality of the environment and human health against chemical and microbiological contamination."
"In addition, more amendments aimed at lowering the standards for contamination are being kept in reserve in case that fails."
"I have recommended that my group cast a ‘yes’ vote after these attempts at dilution have been rejected."
". Portugal is synonymous with a high-quality travel industry."
"One hundred and sixty-nine Portuguese beaches unfurled blue flags in 2003."
"There were 47 in the Algarve alone, including one riverside beach. These results prove the high degree of quality and commitment shown by local authorities in their management of the coastline, particularly with regard to basic sanitation, water supply and pollution."
"Apart from technical and scientific improvements in water management, it behoves us not to forget one recent development. Tourism has created new recreational activities for holidaymakers."
"Apart from bathing, there are now activities such as surfing, windsurfing and sailing. In the Algarve, these sports are becoming more popular all the time among young people."
"Although these new activities are practised further out from shore, I feel that they ought to be protected under the new regime."
"I would argue, therefore, that the definition of ‘bather’ should be extended to include not just swimmers in the strict sense but also those taking part in water sports."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to one more fact, gleaned from my own experience as a mayor."
"Health and water quality are important enough to justify a public information campaign."
"This, however, is the joint responsibility of the EU, its Member States, the regions and local authorities."
"Local authorities alone cannot shoulder the financial burden of ensuring that water quality remains high. That burden includes the financial losses suffered in areas where water quality temporarily falls below the required standard."
"I cast my final vote against this report on the European Commission’s document designed to update a Directive on bathing water dating from as long ago as 1976, no less. I agree with many of the amendments tabled in it, however."
"In particular, I agree with public information on standards of water quality, to be delivered via a simple and universal system of signalling, involving symbols. This would be implemented by the enforcing authorities and tourist information offices, and would include sites where urban waste water is discharged near the bathing area."
"With regard to the languages in which the information should be made available, on the other hand, it is unfortunate that the rapporteur did not pursue to its logical conclusion the principle he formulated in this connection. I believe it is essential to provide such information in a range of languages, not just in English and French."
"I also voted in favour of draft Amendment No 19, on the question of transitory contamination."
"There can be no doubt that the issue of protecting bathers is of fundamental importance to public health, and also to how well tourists are received in Europe."
"As I feel that the text is too intrusive and fails to show sufficient respect for the principle of subsidiarity, however, I was unable to support it overall in the final vote."
"Making the EU rules on bathing water more stringent and then extending them to cover water sports is symptomatic of an inability to leave things alone."
"Instead, these should be the local authorities’ and the Member States’ own areas of responsibility in accordance with the proximity principle, because it is only in a few cases that waste water gives rise to problems across the national borders."
"How are these ill thought-out, centralist and expensive EU rules to operate in purely practical terms, and how are they to be funded, in a country like Sweden with its 95 000 lakes and hundreds of miles of coast?"
"Together with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I have voted ‘no’ in the final vote and supported Amendment No 59 about rejecting the Commission’s proposal in its entirety."
"With a view to limiting the directive’s administrative and economic consequences for the Swedish local authorities, I have signed Amendment No 76, which was voted down: in order to be defined as such, the bathing areas concerned must have ‘more than 100 bathers a day for at least 20 days a year’ and ‘have been designated as bathing water by the competent authorities’."
"This morning, I flew to Strasbourg on the plane that leaves Milan Malpensa at 7 a.m."
"A little sleepy, I found myself in a car with Mr Napolitano and Mr Fiori, who like me were flying from Milan;"
"I half-closed my eyes and I had a kind of vision."
"What did I see Mr President?"
"I saw that we were in Europe in 2050: there were beautiful flowers everywhere, every colour under the sun, so much green; kind people, with kind hearts, there were no more wars; everyone lived happily amongst the flowers."
"I stopped a person who was passing by – and, what a coincidence, it was Mr Sacconi, the rapporteur for this report – who said to me: ‘See, despite everything that has been done in the past, the greenhouse effect has increased, it has grown and grown."
"The whole earth has become a hothouse full of flowers, like the type used by people who want to cultivate flowers, and, in this way, all humans have become better people.’"
"Therefore, I did vote in favour of this report, but I have a doubt, Mr President: would it not, perhaps, be better to let the greenhouse effect increase and let things take their natural course, even with the help of mankind?"
". The Commission’s proposal aims to establish a framework for a monitoring mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions, with a view to implementing the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"Of the many different issues at stake, it might be worth emphasising the following:"
"- measures which encourage a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in an objective, rational manner are much-needed and positive, but it is just as important to emphasise that reduction as a goal must not be mystified or made into a big deal;"
"- the Commission has stated its aim of attempting to establish the right conditions for creating an emissions allowance market, by means of a Community scheme for managing pollutant emissions."
"The Commission, moreover, is seeking to take centre stage yet again in overseeing the extent to which each country is meeting its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The European Parliament is acting, yet again, to stall these plans, ensuring that Member States retain their prerogatives in this area and in respect of their international obligations."
"In conclusion, no solution to the grave threat of air pollution can be envisaged without the necessary research into other sources of energy, such as renewable ones."
"This new debate on the monitoring mechanism of Community greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is in danger of being nothing but a further series of pious hopes if a proactive approach with an element of compulsion is not adopted on this issue."
"We have voted in favour of the amendments aimed at making the mechanism more coercive and rigorous, because the climate situation, as tragically demonstrated by the recent heatwave, requires more than half-measures."
"Over and above the simple regulatory aspect, we have, however, a duty to reflect upon alternative models of development and production."
"We cannot let the market impose laws and criteria that make production the be-all and end-all."
"We need, on the contrary, to make these issues the subject of a genuine choice reflecting the view of society as a whole and, therefore, to give some thought to an alternative transport policy in Europe, edging out road transport, which produces a lot of greenhouse gases."
"We need, by way of continent-wide public policies, to develop public transport for travel by rail, sea and river."
"We need to go a step further in ecological terms, both in the production process and in forms of consumption."
"Other energy choices are needed in the end, beginning with energy savings, an end to nuclear energy and the search for non-polluting and renewable energy solutions."
". I voted in favour of this report, which is part of the European Community’s strategy for complying with the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I would remind you that it was decided at Kyoto that the Union must reduce its gas emissions in the period from 2008 to 2012 by 8% compared with the 1990 levels."
"Adopting this monitoring mechanism, in the form in which it is proposed here, is a basic condition for complying with the targets the Union has set itself in terms of sustainability, first at Copenhagen and then at Lisbon. From now on, moreover, adopting the mechanism appears a more realistic possibility, and more workable in practical terms."
"It is quite true to say that it will only be possible to fulfil the commitments entered into at Kyoto if the information relayed by each Member State is complete, timely, transparent and comparable, and if national inventory systems are introduced at the same time."
"Good progress has been made, then, by tabling amendments to the analytical methods and cooperation procedures, introducing more precise (and reliable) provisions on the frequency of data submission, and requiring that only data which is of interest at Community level will have to be provided."
"In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the European Commission has undertaken to submit a Community greenhouse gas inventory to the Secretariat of the above-mentioned UNFCCC by 15 April each year."
"Mr President, I could not fail to vote in favour of this important report by Mr Lange on reducing emissions of gaseous pollutants."
"It is excellent, I had to vote in favour of it, but I have seen that, after the incident which took place in Parliament with Mr Schulz, the President-in-Office of the Council – Mr Berlusconi – does not miss an opportunity to listen to all the Members who speak in this House."
"After listening to and watching Mr Lange, Mr Berlusconi declared that he had prepared a film in which he saw him as the protagonist."
"Mr Lange was, however, luckier than Mr Schulz, because the film was a remake of ‘Gone with the Wind’, because of the resemblance between Mr Lange and Clark Gable."
"Oh, how I envied and I continue to envy Mr Lange who is to be part of this film, a remake of ‘Gone with the Wind’, as the new romantic Clark Gable!"
"Could I vote against it, Mr President?"
". Given the demands of sustainable development, which is one of our goals, and the widespread advocacy of ‘cross-compliance’ requirements in every sphere of the Union’s economic activity, determined efforts, such as those proposed here, are needed in order to reduce air pollution."
"I have always maintained that a European freight transport policy favouring railways and inland waterways, together with coastal shipping lanes, should be championed over main roads."
"It is important, furthermore, to set stricter limits for emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants from vehicles favoured under such a framework, especially barges and locomotives. In this way, these types of transport will become even more firmly established as the most beneficial and appealing of all."
"Finally, as the rapporteur suggests, I believe it is absolutely crucial to understand that we need more than just stricter limit-values if we are to achieve our air quality targets."
"We also need realistic test procedures, which will, of course, require the adoption of clear rules governing how operators gather and analyse information."
"Such rules are the only way to avoid distortions of competition, and they will come into force through the creation of an internal market based on genuinely sustainable growth."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"I am sure that Mr Lange will be delighted to know that he looks like Clark Gable."
"That concludes the explanations of vote.(1)"
"(2)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A5-0349/2003 by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004, Section III, Commission (C5-0300/2003 – 2003/2001(BUD))."
"- A5-0350/2003 by Mrs Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004, Section I, European Parliament, Section II, Council, Section IV, Court of Justice, Section V, Court of Auditors, Section VI, Economic and Social Committee, Section VII, Committee of the Regions, Section VIII (A), European Ombudsman, Section VIII (B), European Data-Protection Supervisor (C5-0300/3002 – 2003/2002(BUD))."
". – Many thanks, Mr President."
"I can tell you that the result we now have regarding the budget, following the vote in the Committee on Budgets, very much resembles the budget guidelines that we adopted at the start of this year."
"What have the main issues been up to now from the point of view of Parliament?"
"We want to make a success of the integration of the new Member States into the European Union."
"Enlargement must succeed, and that is why we have been saying right from the outset that the 25 countries must be dealt with in a single budget."
"Secondly, we have been saying that we want to do something about stimulating economic growth, in not only the new, but also the existing, Member States."
"I shall come back to that later."
"We have taken an important initiative as regards the development of SMEs in the new, and also in the existing, Member States."
"The third point is that we have to facilitate the integration of the new Member States with the existing ones as much as possible."
"As has already been said several times in earlier debates, this 2004 budget has a number of particular features."
"We are to present a budget for 25 countries now, when we all know that we shall not have a European Union of 25 Member States until 1 May next year."
"Hence, we shall be voting in December on a budget for 15 countries, with a technical annex for the ten new Member States."
"We shall then vote on a supplementary budget for those ten new Member States during next year."
"Another new feature of the 2004 budget is activity-based budgeting."
"We have discovered some more flaws in this, which we hope it will be possible to rectify in the course of this year."
"Particularly important as far as Parliament is concerned is that we are able to look into the extent to which the programmes are being implemented and what kind of evaluation techniques are available."
"By and large, we have voted in favour of an economical budget."
"The payment appropriations have been increased, including other payment appropriations, but, on the whole, I think that this result is suitable for presentation, even at a time when the whole of Europe is economising."
"I should like to say another thing about the various chapters of the budget; firstly, the agricultural budget, Chapter 1."
"We are of course awaiting the letter of amendment, which is due to be issued shortly."
"We hope that Parliament’s initiatives, which are reaffirmed in this budget and which were also put forward in earlier resolutions, will also appear in the Commission’s letter of amendment, to be issued shortly: namely the pilot projects, or preparatory actions, regarding the environmental indicators, funding for animal diseases, the development of better vaccines and the development of a quality policy for agricultural products."
"It will also undoubtedly become clear then what impact the more expensive euro has had on agricultural policy."
"In addition, the Committee on Budgets has voted in favour of a number of further points: we want more research into animal welfare, and we want more alternatives to tobacco-growing in the EU, among other things."
"As regards Chapter 2, the Structural Funds, we have increased payment appropriations in line with the figure the Council considered reasonable."
"We did this for two reasons."
"Firstly, the Member States think that they can spend a great deal more than the Commission proposes each year, and we wanted to accommodate the Member States."
"Secondly, we are concerned about the slow pace of implementation of structural policy."
"We think that increasing the payment appropriations will enable us to make improvements there."
"I hear you saying ‘Is it appropriate to increase the payment appropriations at this time?’"
"If we look at the amount of the increases in payment appropriations in previous years, I think that this is actually a very modest increase in comparison."
"Regarding Chapter 3, internal policies, we consider the promotion of SMEs in the new Member States to be the most important initiative."
"It is possible to do this with a relatively small amount of money."
"With EUR 33 million more than in the Council’s budget, and with an attendant multiplier effect of the order of 20 to 30, we can provide SMEs in Eastern Europe with a good deal more guarantees that they will be able to develop."
"At the same time, we shall tag a training programme for bank managers on to it."
"The chapter on internal policies contains another reduction in relation to the Commission, but an increase in relation to the Council, in respect of measures to be taken in connection with the ever increasing marine pollution."
"There is the European Maritime Agency, which of course has to do its work, but we have found it necessary to limit the appropriations proposed by the Commission, since there is no legal basis as yet."
"We hope that that will be put in place this year, however."
"This year, we also paid a great deal of attention to the agencies."
"More and more of these are appearing; and even newer ones are on their way."
"We want better parliamentary control over these agencies."
"This control over their work programme will be entrusted to the parliamentary committees, and even Parliament itself."
"We also want to pay more attention to the organigram of the agencies, in the same way as we take an interest in the organigram of the Commission itself."
"This is not a difficult thing to require of the agencies."
"We hope that we shall be able to find a solution to this for the second reading."
"A few more points need to be mentioned in connection with Chapter 3."
"In our opinion, the Council must take a decision as soon as possible regarding the seat of the agencies."
"Great uncertainty will reign until this has been taken."
"We believe that VAT fraud must be further investigated."
"The Info-Points Europe are a matter of great concern for Parliament."
"Owing to the new Financial Regulation, there is a possibility that some of these Info-Points will go bankrupt – will have to close their doors – and this whilst virtually everyone in Parliament is convinced that they play a very useful role."
"Finally, we are all familiar with the Eurostat problems."
"We have put 25% of the funds for Eurostat in the reserve pending the final report, which we anticipate towards the end of October."
"There has also been a great deal of discussion on Chapter 4: the external policies of the EU."
"The situation in Iraq predominates here."
"We are of the opinion that something must be done in Iraq."
"We have entered a provision of EUR 30 million in the budget, and we are aware that the Commission has proposed the sum of EUR 200 million, EUR 40 million of which, in all probability, will be paid out of the 2003 budget and EUR 160 million of which out of the 2004 budget, possibly using the flexibility instrument."
"In addition, the Committee on Budgets has adopted an amendment that envisages making EUR 500 million available for Iraq."
"We shall be voting on this next Thursday."
"The prevailing view is that, whichever programme is brought in for Iraq, it must not be at the expense of the existing programmes in Chapter 4: namely Afghanistan, the fight against poverty and so on."
"A further point regarding the Common Foreign and Security Policy is that EUR 5 million of the sum earmarked by the Council has been put in the reserve."
"We want a vigorous dialogue with the Council about the agreement that we recently concluded regarding the provision of information."
"We are aware that the Council may want a little more in this sphere."
"We shall pay this due attention in Parliament, but, first and foremost, we think that, if agreements are concluded with the Council, they must be carried out faithfully."
"We still have some doubts about this at the moment."
"I should like to discuss one last point in connection with the budget, namely administrative expenditure."
"The Commission requested additional staff, but this has only been half-honoured by the Council."
"Parliament takes a different view."
"First of all, we think that the Commission could well do with that staff, in principle."
"Before we say a definitive ‘yes’, however, we attach a number of conditions: the ones set out in the budgetary resolutions and in the resolution by Parliament itself."
"I can give you some examples: the number of vacant posts in the Commission must not exceed 4%, the new posts are to be allocated exclusively to citizens of the new Member States, the Commissioners must respect the code of conduct that they agreed at the beginning of their term of office – particularly with regard to ‘parachutage’, as we always call it – and, last but not least, the Commission must, in our opinion, give its full attention to the implementation of the budget."
"That last point still leaves something to be desired, however, especially regarding the pilot projects and the preparatory actions."
"We shall keep a close eye on this."
"Finally, I should like to thank my fellow MEPs, the Council and the Commission on this occasion, too, for the pleasant cooperation I have enjoyed up to now."
"I have tried to achieve a consensus as far as possible, as befits a rapporteur, and I hope that this cooperation may continue in future, too."
". Mr President, I would like to begin where Mr Mulder left off by first thanking all my colleagues too."
"I would particularly like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the staff for their support and their contributions."
"I would especially like to thank the chairman, Mr Wynn, for his support."
"This particular budget is for an historic year, 2004, which will see not only enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States, but also European elections."
"My main aim for this budget has been to equip all the other institutions to meet the challenges of enlargement and to ensure proper functioning after accession takes place."
"However, I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed that the economies of scale that I had hoped for as a result of enlargement have not been evident."
"I believe that enlargement has been used in some cases as an excuse by some institutions to create posts for which there is little justification."
"It is a pity, therefore, that the Council did not put sufficient emphasis on securing greater efficiencies."
"As I have said before, the Council has been quite generous to all the institutions in its draft budget and, as a consequence, Parliament has had to correct this position."
"I am pleased to say that my amendments, which were adopted, will lead to operational improvements and increased efficiency."
"One of my objectives for this budget was to improve transparency and to achieve greater accountability."
"In this vein, I am calling upon all the institutions to adopt measures which will lead to these objectives being fulfilled."
"To do this, we need to ensure that their policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly, especially in relation to reimbursement of travel and subsistence allowances."
"It appears to be an annual occurrence that one or other of the EU institutions is charged with wrongdoing or lack of control in relation to financial management."
"It is therefore important that every institution ensures that it has best practice and sound financial management procedures in place."
"When it comes to allowances, it is critical that there should be clearer rules governing reimbursement and action to be taken in cases of misdemeanour."
"It is imperative, in the interest of the credibility of all the other institutions, that this be done and that all the institutions act now."
"Furthermore, we need constantly to review our policies and management of systems to ensure that there is no scope for fraud, and I regret that we have not made the further progress we hoped for on the activity-based budgeting that the Commission adopted."
"I believe that all the other institutions need to follow suit, to ensure greater transparency and accountability."
"Let me give you just one example from Parliament."
"I spent quite a lot of time pushing for this internally and I visited the Swedish Parliament to look at their system, where they have made a great deal of progress."
"I have also looked into some of the smaller issues such as the car service for Members."
"We have looked at numerous proposals from the administration, some of which would have been very cost-effective."
"Yet unfortunately these proposals have had a very short life-span, because they were unacceptable to certain parties."
"It is because of this lack of transparency and accountability that we have a situation where a majority of the Committee on Budgets was totally against a pilot scheme for a Members' car service."
"The scheme proposed instead would reimburse Members an additional 50 euro a week for the cost of taxis."
"This is complete nonsense, because we already have an adequate daily allowance to cover such costs."
"However, I understand this is to go ahead despite the huge misgivings that I and many other Members have, because the Bureau has approved it."
"It comes from a budget line that is underspent."
"This sort of example of piecemeal decision-making does not really give a very good impression of Parliament and it is very damaging to the public standing of this House."
"If we had more transparency and accountability, decisions like this would be avoided."
"President, when I spoke in March, I expressed my reservations about the funding of political parties being included in Parliament's budget."
"My concern was that we would leave ourselves open to allegations of feathering our nests and being seen to be looking after our own political interest."
"These concerns appear to have been vindicated, since the funding of political parties has now been included in our budget and already the proposed amount has been increased from 4.2 to 8.4 million as a result of Mr Watson's amendment."
"Now there are moves to take this amount out of reserve and put it on the line, before we have a clear set of rules governing the deployment of these funds and a clear code of conduct."
"Do not get me wrong."
"We all want the European political parties to have the necessary means to function and to be independent of Parliament and the political groups."
"I want to take this opportunity to remind colleagues that the principle behind the statute for political parties was to enhance transparency, something which appears to have been forgotten by some groups in this House."
"They have tabled amendments that undermine this transparency and suggest that this money should be allocated unconditionally."
"I would urge them to withdraw these proposals so that we can put a clear set of rules in place and make the statute operational."
"Another controversial item, and one that has been raised here before, is the question of health insurance for former Members."
"My position on this is quite clear."
"I have said previously that I do not think it is a good use of taxpayers' money and I hope that the study that is undertaken will prove this point."
"Now I just want to say a couple of words about some of the other amendments which have been tabled, beginning with the WTO."
"I am extremely concerned about further extending Parliament's budget, which is meant to be purely for administrative purposes, to non-parliamentarians from other parts of the world."
"What this amendment is proposing is to extend funding from Parliament's budget to other participants at the WTO."
"We already have this line in the Commission's budget and, while I appreciate that there are administrative problems in obtaining some money from Parliament's budget and some from the Commission's, I do not think that is any reason to move it all together."
"I think it is right that it should stay in the Commission's budget."
"We just need to deal with whatever glitches and hitches appear in the budget."
"At the end of the day it would be quite cumbersome for Parliament to take it all on board, as this would also have internal implications for staffing and so on."
"With regard to the EPP amendment putting Council salaries into reserve, I think it is very regrettable that we have this proposal in front of us, I would like to remind Members that we have a 'gentleman's agreement' saying that we do not interfere with each other's budget."
"I do not really understand the motive or purpose of the proposal and I have heard no arguments or rationale in support of it."
"I do not find it very helpful at this late stage to put forward something like this and I would like to know more about why it is proposed to put this money in reserve."
"Finally, on the amendment on bicycles from Mrs Buitenweg, given what I have said about cars, I am all in favour and I think we should all get on our bikes now."
"Anyway, to conclude, can I say that one of our fundamental aims has been to bring ourselves closer to citizens."
"Can I say that I am extremely frustrated at the pace of progress with our information and communication policy."
"And I am even more frustrated at the Commission's efforts, which may result, I understand, in closure of many of the Infopoints."
"In my region of the West Midlands the ordinary person really has no idea of what we are doing in this House."
"We need to do more to make citizens aware of our work, to increase their interest in it and to increase their participation."
". Mr President, honourable Members, around this time next year, the European Parliament, having been elected by the people of twenty-five European states, will discuss the first budget of the enlarged Union."
"The debate will be conducted in twenty languages."
"Parliament will then have 732 Members, and it will be the last budget to be prepared by the Prodi Commission, which will by then comprise 30 members."
"The discussion of the 2005 budget could coincide with the debates on the financial programming for the period after 2006."
"At the same time, the Member States will probably be ratifying the new Constitutional Treaty in accordance with their respective internal procedures."
"The draft general budget before you today reflects the enormity of this challenge."
"The budget has been drawn up for a fifteen-member EU for the first four months of 2004 and for an EU with twenty-five members from 1 May onwards."
"Moreover, it is presented in a new form, based on the principle of activity-based budgeting, which enables us to discern the precise cost of the various Community policies."
"Under the present parliamentary proposal, the budget for 2004 would allow for financial commitments amounting to EUR 112.3 billion, as against the figure of EUR 111.9 billion set by the Council and the EUR 112.2 billion proposed by the Commission."
"So we are not actually dealing with very wide divergences."
"Of the aforementioned amounts, a sum of EUR 12 billion is to be earmarked for the ten new Member States."
"Of the commitment appropriations made in the 2004 budget, 79% cover the domains of agricultural policy, including support for rural areas, and of the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund."
"This represents a 13% increase on this year’s allocation to these subsections."
"Since the allocation to the Structural Funds is laid down in the financial programming for the 15-member EU and in the Accession Treaty for the new Member States, there are no differences between the Council, Parliament and the Commission with regard to the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund."
"In the domain of support for rural areas, however, you will be voting on Thursday to determine whether you propose that the amount laid down in the financial programming should be exceeded."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Interinstitutional Agreement should be preserved."
"As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, the Commission will present its customary amending letter at the end of the month to take account of the latest market trends."
"I do not intend to anticipate the content of that letter, since it still has to be confirmed by the Commission, but I can indicate that most of the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, which have been the subject of intensive discussion, will be adopted, particularly the proposals that additional funds be allocated to finance a study examining whether and how farmers throughout Europe could be at least partly insured against losses arising from epizootic diseases and that funds be earmarked for the production of environmental indicators, which are playing an increasingly important role, as you know, in the context of the agricultural reform process, and for examination of the possibility of introducing a European quality label."
"Scope is provided for more intensive research into marker vaccines against epizootic diseases within the resources allocated in the preliminary draft budget."
"Mr Mulder, you have convinced the Commission of the soundness of your proposals."
"I am confident that you will succeed in convincing the Council too."
"I should certainly like to add my own plea to the Council not to reject these proposals out of hand simply because they relate to compulsory expenditure."
"There would be no substantive justification for such rejection, nor would it be consistent with the prevailing spirit of constructive cooperation."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can certainly welcome wholeheartedly the restoration by Parliament of the 272 new posts requested by the Commission for enlargement-related tasks, which the Council had deleted from the establishment plan."
"On this point may I address a special word of thanks not only to the rapporteur but also to Mrs Gill and to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"You will initially enter these posts in the reserve, which I, naturally, see as less than ideal, but I can assure you that I shall do everything in my power to meet the prescribed requirements so that the funding for these posts can be released at the second reading."
"With regard to the administrative appropriations in the budget, I should like to deal with two more points. The first of these concerns contributions to European political parties, to which Mrs Gill has just referred."
"This expenditure will be included in the EU budget for the first time, now that the legal basis for its inclusion has, I am glad to say, finally been adopted."
"I believe that a good and transparent arrangement has been devised, but I am naturally critical of the statement that this expenditure is to be financed outside Parliament’s 20% share of the appropriation for administrative expenditure."
"The Commission, needless to say, will be willing to negotiate in order to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties."
"My second point concerns the new Financial Regulation."
"This successful product of our joint reforming activity entails many changes."
"These changes are reflected in the new division of the budget into policy areas, and associated with this is another new rule, whereby financial assistance in the form of grants from the EU budget to institutions, such as the Institute in Florence, to name but one, requires a legal basis."
"This means that it is no longer enough for these amounts to be entered in the budget; instead, there must be a legal basis for the authorisation of such grants, and they are also subject to the new conditions laid down in the Financial Regulation, which lays special emphasis on the need for transparent decision-making."
"Parliament has made painstaking efforts to discuss the Commission’s proposals on the budget headings under chapter A-30, which have been on the table since May."
"In the case of the Council, however, progress has been anything but satisfactory, and I wish to take this opportunity to appeal once again to the Council to make every effort to ensure that, at the next trilogue session, we are able to foresee when the relevant legislation can be adopted."
"I ask the Council to approach the implementation of the Financial Regulation with the same enthusiasm that it invested in its reformulation."
"As was the case last year, the Commission will inform Parliament in writing, in the first half of November, of its assessment of the feasibility of your proposed measures, especially the new pilot projects and preparatory measures."
"I shall ensure that due consideration is given in this assessment to the importance that your House attaches to these activities."
"There is another important respect in which conditions are set fair for the budget of the European Union, namely the fact that the budgetary authority is due to take a joint decision in November on the adjustment of the various support programmes, the so-called internal policies, in preparation for enlargement."
"There are, of course, very many important programmes – the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the YOUTH programme and the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE), to name but a few."
"May I express my gratitude to Mr Böge and Mr Colom i Naval for their efforts to coordinate the work of all the specialised committees, and I am naturally delighted that we agree with so many of their proposals."
"This close cooperation is another reason why I can truly say that it has been a great pleasure to work with you on the preparation of the budget for the enlarged Union."
"With regard to foreign aid, we face a new challenge in the 2004 budget in that it is our duty and our desire to make European aid available to the people of Iraq."
"We have spent EUR 100 million on humanitarian aid this year."
"Now it is a matter of playing our part in the reconstruction effort."
"We have addressed this point in our committees and in the trilogue framework, and it has also been discussed by the General Affairs Council."
"The Commission is proposing a further injection of EUR 200 million between now and the end of next year, over and above our humanitarian aid."
"But this aid cannot actually be disbursed unless the security situation improves, and the umbrella of the United Nations must be available for the implementation of projects."
"There are still various different opinions in this House on the appropriate amount of aid for Iraq."
"The Commission’s proposal has been carefully weighed up, and I should like to remind you that you are due to vote on this matter on Thursday, the day before the donors’ conference in Madrid."
"For this reason, I urge you, on behalf of the Commission and particularly on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Patten, to give the Commission a clear mandate by signalling that the European Union speaks with one voice on this issue."
"Let me close with a few figures on the volume of next year’s general budget."
"The Commission had proposed expenditure of EUR 100.6 billion, the Council has proposed EUR 100.1 billion, and you, in Parliament, will probably propose a volume of EUR 103.5 billion."
"The European expenditure-to-GDP ratio in this domain would therefore lie somewhere between 0.09% and 1.01%."
"There has never been so little divergence between our proposals in recent years, and I am certain that we shall iron out these small differences in the course of the budgetary procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to state the position of my group on the Mulder report concerning the draft general budget for the financial year 2004."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his hard work to achieve a consensus. The latter is always difficult to reach at first reading when all the parties involved are intent on promoting their own priorities."
"The rapporteur has done a good job. The draft now before us is supported by most of the House."
"My group endorses the draft presented today."
"We believe it is in line with the key tenets of our strategic position."
"It seems a moderate approach to the increase of payment appropriations has emerged from first reading."
"Account is taken of Member States’ need to comply with the Stability Pact and the requirement to absorb the balance."
"Account is also taken of requests by observers from future Member States. They would like an increase in payments, in line with the sums agreed at Copenhagen."
"Nonetheless, these modest figures for the increase of payment appropriations should become a threshold for Parliament."
"In principle, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not envisage further negotiations on subsequent reductions by the Council between now and second reading and conciliation."
"As regards the Mulder report, however, we retain the amendments consequent upon our group’s position."
"Firstly, there is the reference to the financial perspective after 2006."
"We can agree to an internal debate on this subject being launched by the current Commission, although we believe it is far too early for such a debate to be leading to decisions on the subject."
"Once the new Parliament and Commission come into being in 2004 it should fall to them to take the decisions."
"We call for provisions to this effect to be included in the resolution."
"Concerning the debate on the former A-30 lines, my group is very concerned that failure to reach agreement within the Council could delay adoption of the new legal bases."
"A Council proposal for conciliation on 24 November is required."
"Should the aforementioned agreement be delayed, there might be unfortunate consequences for organisations currently receiving subsidies from the Union."
"There needs to be some means of putting pressure on the Council. We are therefore retaining our amendment regarding the basic remuneration of the Council’s staff."
"I refer to the EUR 1 million in reserve. The rapporteur, Mrs Gill, is aware of all this."
"In addition, we call for the reference in the resolution to be stricter and more specific."
"Turning to Heading 4, all the groups have reached a most satisfactory agreement to safeguard the European Parliament’s priorities concerning geographical areas. The Commission’s preliminary draft proposal was inadequate."
"It contained two interrelated problems. Firstly, it distorted the very structure of the budget, creating an unrealistic margin."
"Decisions on allocations for the Union's external action cannot be taken solely on the basis of accounting criteria or criteria for budget implementation. The credits approved amount to political signals sent out by the Union to third countries."
"Secondly, the Council’s first reading took place on the basis of the figures in the preliminary draft proposal."
"Credits were further reduced, as if that were feasible. The wrong political signals were sent out, and no account taken of the European Parliament’s traditional priorities."
"I should emphasise that this House is sovereign. It is responsible and well able to reconcile political priorities with desirable levels of implementation."
"Thursday’s vote will be on a real margin, not on a virtual one."
"Lastly, I am sure the amendment will deal with the following issue, and that other speakers will speak on it at greater length and more eloquently. I simply wished to ask honourable Members to consider whether in the light of the United Nations resolution, the Union should actually offer to the Donors Conference that scant sum proposed by the Commission and agreed by the Council."
"In such a scenario, what would become of the Union’s political initiative if the only amendment tabled is rejected?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me thank both the rapporteurs for the work they have done this year."
"I believe that we have been able to incorporate in this Budget a number of things that not only consolidate what we already have, and make clear where our priorities lie, but also make it abundantly clear that, whilst retaining what has stood the test of time, we also want to demonstrate a flexible approach to the tasks with which the future will present us."
"Let me give as an example our desire to use more funds for the prevention of crises rather than for trouble-shooting."
"We want to combat the VAT fraud in Europe, so that the European Union’s receipts can be improved, and so that we do not have to extract from taxpayers money that other people should be honest enough to pay."
"Fraud stands at a high level, and that is something we want to combat."
"There is consensus on the need for us to take action to deal with it."
"We are preparing the European Union for demographic change and for the demands that this will bring with it; at any rate, we have taken this as our theme, and we want more and improved cooperation in the war on organised crime."
"This Budget reflects our desire to strengthen and support Eurojust and Europol."
"This European Union of ours will continue in future to be characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises, which, as they give life to the economy, we want to support and enable them to enjoy the advantages of the internal market and use them to the utmost."
"We will orient this Budget as far as possible towards savings."
"What this means is that our group has looked closely at the various areas with an eye to ensuring that what is demanded of the Member States – which are themselves currently having problems with their budgets – is nothing more than is unavoidable and necessary."
"We will stick to that line in each of the various categories, as it is clear to us that the multiannual financial framework that we have laid down following negotiations with the Council is not merely optional, but a fixed point of reference, and it sets the bounds within which we want to manoeuvre."
"In category 1B, then, we will not be advocating that the upper limits be exceeded, nor will we vote for it."
"All those in this House who want to do that must know that this resolution may well be only at first reading stage – and so it can be said that it does not count, as the counting is done at the end – but it does indicate whether or not we want to keep to the upper limits in this area."
"We will not, in any case give our support to any attempt to exceed the upper limits."
"In other areas, too, we want to ensure the targeted use of the money at our disposal, but also that we keep to what we have promised."
"We will make available the staff that enlargement requires."
"We will adjust the multiannual programmes in order that nothing of what they contain should be lost."
"We will also make sure that the Structural Funds contain sufficient payment appropriations for the candidate countries, to whom it will have to be made plain that this means that, next year or right through the period we have negotiated with them, they will get not one euro extra; there is only the possibility of certain obligations being discharged earlier."
"We will call for payments from the Structural Funds to be increased, for we believe that the existing backlog in payments must not be tolerated."
"We have to ensure that what has been announced and promised is actually kept to, and that we actually do whatever we can to help support the regions."
"We will therefore be asking for additional funding, which is also what the members of the Council, the individual Member States, will say that they want when asked individually."
"As soon as the Council meets as a body, it always has a problem with making sufficient funding available."
"So, although we will be calling for additional funding, that will – as you have said yourself – of course remain within the bounds of what is necessary."
"Commissioner Schreyer has said that there has never before been such a small difference between your and our proposals."
"The biggest problem is with category 4."
"As Mr Garriga Polledo has said, we have seen to it that our traditional areas are maintained, but this House has before it an amendment on aid for Iraq, in which EUR 500 million are asked for – EUR 500 million, even though we know from the most diverse published sources, especially the Commission’s own, that it will not in any way be possible to properly administer these EUR 500 million in Iraq next year."
"No administrative structures are in place, and there is nobody on the ground who can put the money to proper use."
"Even though there are no projects to which the money is to be allocated, this figure of EUR 500 million has been put before us, and a majority in the Committee on Budgets has even adopted it."
"To those who tabled this amendment, I say that, just as involvement in the war in Iraq split the European Union, so their amendment divides this House."
"They are not interested in a joint solution; rather, they want the EUR 500 million to serve as a warning that we could use it now, and want to be congratulated on doing so."
"The money must, however, be properly applied, as we have to demand it of our taxpayers, who know that it must also be found within the framework of the Financial Perspective, and that the framework of the Financial Perspective will not come up with the money."
"They are urging that the Financial Perspective be cancelled."
"That we will not do under any circumstances."
"We will be in favour of sufficient funding being made available, in which respect the Commission proposal is a very good one that deserves to be taken seriously, and we unreservedly endorse it."
"We will insist that these funds be used in accordance with a UN mandate."
"We will support Commissioner Patten in his line, we will see to it that the debate on how the money is to be spent focuses on helping people to help themselves, for Iraq must get help, but we have had to help others in the past."
"Afghanistan did not get more than this; it got less."
"Iraq has the potential to be a rich country."
"Giving it more than we gave Afghanistan would be criminal; it would be to treat with disdain the other regions of the world that we supported in the past."
"Under no circumstances will a single vote of ours support this amendment."
"– Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the budget, Mrs Neena Gill and Mr Jan Mulder, for their excellent and constructive work."
"My group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is proud that Mr Jan Mulder, who is one of our members, is general rapporteur."
"For that we particularly want to thank the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, with whom we reached political agreement on the matter at the start of this parliamentary term."
"I likewise want to say how highly I regard the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Terence Wynn, and the Budgets Commissioner, Michaele Schreyer, for their friendly and expert cooperation."
"Next year’s is a historic budget, because for the first time it is being drafted for a Union of 25 Member States."
"Formally it is being made legally binding on 15 Member States, but politically the budget is to be agreed this year to apply to a Union of 25 Member States."
"Secondly, the budget has been drawn up as an activity-based budget."
"This is something the ELDR Group has been consistently calling for for a long time now."
"In this way we can monitor with greater accuracy the costs associated with different policy areas, how administrative expenditure relates to operational expenditure, as well as general efficiency."
"This is a big reform, which at the same time emphasises the importance of personal accountability, and it will create a basis for later activity-based management in the Commission."
"The proposal in the wake of the debate by the Committee on Budgets contains many important areas of focus."
"I would like to mention a few of them."
"With regard to agriculture, the committee gave export aid for live cattle its own separate budget heading."
"This means we will be in a better position to monitor this controversial activity."
"I think the budget heading under which appropriations are being earmarked for the development of marker vaccines is especially important."
"Up till now the European Union has worked on the principle that, for example, animals should not be vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease, as this way one cannot tell whether immunity is due to the infection spreading the disease or the vaccines."
"It is clear, however, that vaccines also have to be used to achieve lasting prevention of animal diseases."
"Appropriations for rural development exceed the finance ceiling."
"Our group cannot support this amendment proposed by the PSE Group, as it does not accord with good administration."
"It is furthermore questionable whether these funds could be used because equivalent regulations on the subject of finance are already in force."
"We think it inevitable that Structural Funds payment appropriations will have to be adequately increased, to prevent outstanding commitments, or RALs, from growing out of control, as they have up till now."
"The biggest problem with the draft budget concerns the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Our group cannot support the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to spend EUR 500 million on assisting the reconstruction of Iraq."
"Instead, we are prepared to support extra financing of around EUR 200 million in addition to the EUR 100 million granted in humanitarian aid."
"It is our opinion, however, that the main share of this – EUR 100 million approximately – should be financed out of the flexibility instrument, as otherwise Parliament’s priorities would run into trouble."
"There is an argument within Parliament over aid relief earmarked for organisations and bodies."
"The ELDR Group strongly favours doing away with it as it is in contravention of the current Financial Regulation."
"At the end of the day, it is a sort of favouritism."
"In our opinion, the European Parliament is not a committee or an agency that deals with applications for assistance or grants."
"That is why we should abandon this system."
"With these observations we support the reports by Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I have followed the work of the budget rapporteurs, Mr Jan Mulder and Mrs Neena Gill, carefully on behalf of my group. I want to thank them for their diligence and the transparent way in which they have worked, even though our conclusions for next year’s budget are not the same in all respects."
"Our group would have liked Mr Mulder to meet us halfway in Category 4 of the budget so that our proposal for appropriations for Palestine and East Timor could have been adopted."
"The serious problems of the Middle East have had too little attention paid to them in the debate on next year’s budget."
"Not everybody in our group likes Mrs Gill’s proposal to take an appropriation from the budget to start support for European political parties using Parliament’s funds."
"Many in our group feel that support for European parties will only restrict democracy, not increase it."
"That way the big parties in the big countries could subjugate the small parties in the small countries."
"I would focus your attention on the fact that the Council deleted the clause in the regulations governing the parties which said that a European party could not provide funds for national parties in national elections."
"Now it can, and this means European taxpayers’ money will be spent on national election propaganda."
"On the other hand, we support the ideas put forward by Mrs Gill on the committee regarding how necessary it is to make the work of the European Parliament more efficient."
"For example, the excess on the allowances for Parliament’s car service this year must be looked into carefully, and next year we cannot introduce a new system for claiming expenses for the use of taxis without a decision made in plenary."
"We also have to make a determined effort to endorse the Members’ Statute, so that we can do away with a system that allows travel expenses to be claimed for no clear reason."
"Most of all our group criticises the EUR 500 million appropriation in next year’s budget for the reconstruction of Iraq passed in the committee by a vote by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"That is not solidarity aid for Iraq, but for the United States of America."
"The Right in Europe seems to be lying prostrate before the United States."
"It wants to share in the costs of the US oil war in a way that greatly exceeds the need for aid set at EUR 200 million, as proposed by the Commission."
"By this means, the Right wants to use tax revenue from the citizens of the EU to support America’s illegal war, America’s illegal occupation and the puppet government America has set up in Iraq."
"Our group is prepared to discuss the Commission’s proposals to assist Iraq, but we reject the PPE-DE Group’s political gesture to President Bush and his war coalition."
"Other representatives of our group will adopt a position on problems relating to the Structural Funds in their speeches."
"Mr President, I too should like to start by addressing the rapporteurs on behalf of my group."
"My compliments to Mrs Neena Gill, who has succeeded in placing the emphasis in the budget and in the resolution on value for money."
"I know how important it is for her and I share her vision in this."
"Likewise Mr Jan Mulder, who in the Netherlands would by no means be my natural ally, I should like to thank very much for the flexible cooperation we have had and the openness he has shown towards our proposals."
"Of course, I am prone to consider this a sign of openness and rationality, for the very reason that a great number of our proposals have actually been adopted."
"For this I thank him."
"I would however like to concentrate on a number of difficulties, because some do still remain."
"On Thursday we are voting on the budget."
"This is quite specifically about what we do and do not want to spend tax money on."
"But the PPE seems above all to want to play symbol politics, I really cannot interpret their proposal for 500 million for Iraq in any other way."
"The European Commission has investigated how much money the European Union can effectively set aside in Iraq."
"It was EUR 160 million for next year, not counting humanitarian aid."
"This does of course seem miserly compared with the billions from the United States."
"But Bush’s cheque also covers the troops on the spot and investments for companies."
"In its assessment for the absorption capacity the Commission expressly looked at the security situation in Iraq."
"All kinds of PPE pipe dreams are involved here."
"Because the more than tripling of the amount that the Commission is proposing must above all be a signal that the US has the situation under control, that things are really going fine in Iraq."
"But for the time being it is above all also a signal that the PPE is not really concerned about spending of tax money carefully."
"This big-heartedness stands out starkly against the PPE’s plans for Afghanistan."
"Because this is a country that is poorer than Iraq and with considerably fewer development opportunities."
"Here the PPE suddenly makes all kinds of new requirements for the spending of the money that are completely impractical."
"That you know."
"But the Afghans will be receiving as much as EUR 35 million less if the Commission fails to curb the drugs trade and to bring about a changeover to the cultivation of other crops."
"What is interesting is that the PPE, which usually harbours a somewhat natural suspicion of the European Commission, is now suddenly convinced that the European Commission can succeed where the United States has failed with the war on drugs in other countries."
"So here too we have an instance above all of symbol politics, but in this case with potentially dangerous consequences."
"The Greens are also sometimes criticised for playing symbol politics."
"I am talking for instance about our amendment with regard to the financing of the structural funds to say explicitly that no European money may be spent on projects that are inconsistent with European directives such as the Habitat Directive or the Birds Directive."
"Superfluous, the Committee on Budgets decided almost unanimously, because it is logical that you do not use tax money to contravene laws – and that I find logical too."
"Were it not that I can give you a whole list of projects in which in some cases even the court has judged that they violate European directives."
"I will just mention a few of the projects that receive money from the structural funds: the dam over the Odelouca River in the Algarve in Portugal, the Alqueva dam in Portugal, the Rücken bridge project in Germany, the Ebro basin in Spain, the Boyne estuary in Northeastern Ireland."
"In the last five years 529 breaches of European environmental legislation have been recorded."
"Let us in any event ensure that this is not happening with European tax money!"
"A moment ago, rapporteur Gill gave her support to my amendment for a few bicycles, so that parliamentarians can cover short distances cheaply and sustainably."
"This led to great hilarity, which to some extent is perfectly understandable."
"But of course you are not under any obligation to cycle."
"As I would refuse to throw away those EUR 50 a week, which come on top of our generous daily allowance, on a taxi ride, you do not have to get on your bike."
"But do give those who want to the chance to do so!"
"I said yesterday in the Committee on Budgets that in return for the support of this House for this amendment I would be glad to take the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets on the back for a test ride."
"I should hereby like to repeat this promise in public."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Commission, Mr Wynn and the Secretariat staff, excellently led, as always, by Mr de Feo."
"This budget, ladies and gentlemen, with which the Europe of 15 comes to an end, is historic because it brings us, at last, to a Europe of 25; furthermore, it can be seen as a pre-election campaign budget."
"The solutions that we found apply to everything and everyone."
"What I am concerned about in this case is what happens next, what I am concerned about is definitely the accession of ten countries."
"How will we cope afterwards?"
"We must start thinking about this today, endeavouring to revise the Financial Perspective, endeavouring to inject new resources, endeavouring to thoroughly revise our procedure, because there will, inevitably, be some complications when there are 25 of us debating matters rather than 15: we need to start today, now, and not when we find ourselves in a state of emergency or urgency."
"I want to stress this point because we could have serious problems, irrespective of the political line-up."
"There are three things I would like to focus on."
"Firstly, Iraq."
"There is a huge debate on the proposed amendment, but I do not see why there should be outrage."
"We have provided over EUR 1 billion for Palestine, we have provided over EUR 1 billion for the Balkans, we have also provided a lot of money, EUR 1 billion, for Afghanistan."
"I do not believe that appropriating EUR 200 million, and then asking the day after to increase this figure to EUR 500 million, is outrageous, unless we want to treat international crises differently according to our political assessments, which would not affect us politically but would affect the people in question."
"Secondly, I would certainly like to focus on investment in the TENs, which is important and which we must try to support because it means development and jobs."
"I would, therefore, like to thank you for supporting this amendment, but I would call, at this point, for even more resources to try to make TENs become a political instrument across Europe and not just a technical decision."
"Thirdly, one of the amendments tabled is extremely important, and I would ask all the political groups to take notice of it: an amendment regarding the accommodation centre for disabled officials, the centre."
"We are going to vote for the amendment and I would ask everyone to raise awareness on this matter."
"We will be proud of it and we will do ourselves credit, both now and in the future."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"To begin with some remarks about Chapter 4, the central discussion point."
"The Commission’s proposal to move support to Turkey from Chapter 4 to Chapter 7, pre-accession support, is of course premature."
"That country is not after all a candidate Member State with a concrete prospect of accession."
"Then the support for the reconstruction of Iraq."
"We find it embarrassing that members from the left in particular are unwilling to go beyond EUR 200 million."
"This is a mere pittance compared to the EUR 1.5 billion that Japan is voting and the 22 billion that the United States is setting aside on top of the expenditure that it has already incurred for the liberation of that country."
"The amendment by Mr Wurtz and others is nothing less than a slap in the face of every Iraqi who suffered for years under the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, the bloodhound who was openly acclaimed by Arafat and many Palestinians even after the extent of his atrocities had become known."
"Besides, Arafat channelled hundreds of millions into secret accounts."
"As long as that money goes to help terrorism we cannot tell our voters that the European Union is still the main sponsor of the Palestinian authority."
"As far as the Gill report is concerned, we agree with Mr Walter’s Amendment No 1."
"He rightly points to the need to coordinate the support of multilingualism, both here and in the other institutions, with actual need."
"The culture surrounding travelling and meeting expense claims at the Committee of the Regions continues to concern us greatly."
"The internal auditor must have sufficient assistance to do his job adequately."
"Finally, we ask the Council to honour the modest requests of the Court of Auditors in full."
"Prevention of new frauds requires not only sound financial management but also strong external control."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen – I cannot address the Council since it is represented only by very worthy officials, but I hope the absence of the Presidency is a good sign, meaning that the Council agrees with the provisions which Parliament is about to adopt and that we shall have an uncontroversial and therefore very simple second reading."
"I, too, should like to thank both rapporteurs for their work and acknowledge all those who have taken part in this collective effort."
"Mr Mulder deserves thanks for having, in particular, pointed out that this yearly exercise of ours is in danger of being reduced to political fiction, a string of good intentions and good proposals."
"We have become merely an expensive NGO, allowing ourselves to amend and comment on the budget and make recommendations which are then invariably not implemented."
"One just has to look at the billions of euro that we return to the Member States every year; regrettably, one just has to look at the total outstanding commitments."
"I have taken note of Commissioner Schreyer’s commitment to give us a practical answer right away, so that the 2004 financial year may be an historic one in this respect too, in other words so that there may, at last, be some similarity between what the budgetary authorities decide and what is then actually implemented with regard to the 2004 budget."
"Out of the great many positive and negative points to underline, I should like to focus on the question of the amendment on Iraq."
"Mr Walter has told us that his group, and he himself, do not intend to support this amendment."
"In addition, we have read in the newspapers that the German Government will not even be represented in Madrid, as, indeed, it was not at the European Council meeting."
"This is starting to become a habit;"
"I do not know whether it will be represented by France there too."
"There is, however, no doubt that, in view of the Security Council resolution and the new phase that is beginning, we now have the problem that Europe’s response is still the same as before the Security Council resolution, which – I repeat – is ushering in a new phase in which all the political groupings, or many of them at least, even the hostile ones, have modified their positions."
"I believe that we cannot stand still and send Commissioner Schreyer to the Conference with this tiny and, quite frankly, laughable sum for what I consider an important proposal, which, although it will wreck the Financial Perspective, is, at least, an attempt to achieve unity and a common policy, requiring support from the budget."
"That is why we shall support that amendment."
"Lastly, on the Gill report, I should like to underline what the rapporteur has said about the need to provide the citizens with more information, an area on which we are delighted to agree."
"I thank the rapporteur for having accepted this amendment aimed at strengthening the on-line information policy and arranging for all our debates to be transmitted to the citizens over the Internet from next year."
"Mr President, I would like to raise two amendments that were tabled by the PPE-DE Group but rejected in committee, which we have retabled for the plenary."
"The first has been mentioned several times already today, and that is contributions to European political parties."
"Here most of the items our group wanted were included in the final version of the paragraph, except that there is a reserve against the whole amount."
"We want to see that reserve lifted."
"We would point out that far from there allegedly being no code of conduct, there will certainly be measures to secure separation between types of expenditure – between information and political expenditure – and a code of conduct on the use of appropriations entered under this heading."
"We want to see that reserve lifted."
"It is evident that there will be no spending before June of next year, that is until after the elections take place."
"And we should trust in the good faith of people in the political parties in the European Parliament."
"The second item is the very small item of EUR 37 000, which relates to the creation of an A7 post in the Commission office in Washington."
"Again this afternoon we have heard several speakers who really are not particularly in favour of good relations between the European Parliament and the US Administration."
"This small investment will pay off extremely handsomely in terms of two-way cooperation and understanding, and I would urge that the majority of only one vote in committee should be overturned by a successful vote in plenary."
"The third point is not contentious."
"I urge the PPE-DE Group, as shadow rapporteur on the Gill report, to support the amendment tabled by Mr Walter, on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"This relates to the need for the verbatim proceedings to be looked at carefully again."
"First of all, I applaud the very speedy and accurate work done by Parliament's staff in producing verbatim versions of speeches in this Chamber."
"These are translated into the main languages within a few days, but it is unrealistic to expect that full verbatim translations should be produced in all the languages of the enlarged European Union."
"We need to achieve better value for money and to tailor the scarce interpretation and translation skills to best advantage."
"Individual requests, as called for in the amendment for particular needs, must surely be the way forward."
"The European Union needs to use the latest technology available to meet these needs."
"I appreciate that there will have to be an authorisation and monitoring system, but this will show the real needs of people and deliver the flexibility we should aim for."
"In this way we will be responding to the wishes of European citizens, instead of producing mountains of paperwork that destroy forests and also stand the chance of not being read."
"My final two points are again on the language items, firstly regarding full controlled multilingualism."
"In Amendment No 4 we are calling for the adoption of specific measures by the Bureau and 'the evaluation of the report by the Committee on Budgets on the basis of a working document drafted by its rapporteur'."
"This is a very important matter."
"It would involve the Language Centre in Luxembourg and a greater focus on teleworking."
"My final point concerns taking account of the extended multilingualism of the new Parliament."
"We need to make sure that we have proper, concrete measures introduced to help the accession countries find their way around more easily than we were able to a few years ago."
"Mr President, in the light of some of the matters that have been discussed in this debate, I have to keep reminding myself that this is the first reading."
"One of the problems is that the debate is concentrating on what we have voted in committee already and what we may well vote in plenary on Thursday."
"The final outcome may be the same; then again it could be different in certain areas, such as category 1(b), where in committee we voted for a figure above the EUR 83 million margin for the less favoured areas."
"My friend and colleague, Mr Walter, has made the point that there may be a change in the vote of his particular Group, in which case there would not be a qualified majority and therefore the problem would be solved."
"However, if it did secure a qualified majority, let us not forget that this is the first reading and the question could be resolved in due course."
"Much has been said about the one issue that is dominating category 4: namely, what is to be done about the funding of Iraq."
"Whether we adopt or reject the amendment for EUR 500 million, let us not forget that – as I keep saying – it is still the first reading."
"On the issue of Iraq, it is also worth mentioning that the Council for the first time has invited Mr Brok and myself to go to Madrid for the donors' conference, an extremely generous and welcome offer."
"Unfortunately, neither of us can go, but we will be replaced by Baroness Nicholson from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Mrs Jensen from the Committee on Budgets, so we will at least be represented."
"As Chairman, it is my job to respect the committee's position, not to oppose it."
"I realise that I am the servant of the committee and I try to reflect what we have voted."
"Then again, after the vote in the plenary, it is my job also to reflect that position."
"When it comes to the EUR 500 million, there is confusion in my mind."
"I know what we voted, but I also know what has been said."
"For instance, when Commissioner Patten addressed the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets – Mrs Schreyer sent her apologies, she was at another meeting at the same time – he made it clear that EUR 200 million was, in the Commission's opinion, the maximum that could be utilised, based on the assessment of needs."
"At the Brussels summit last week, which I followed with great interest, not one Member State asked for any amount above the EUR 200 million."
"When Commissioner Patten made his proposals, he made the point that this was the figure he would be taking to Madrid for the donors' conference."
"I also heard this morning – whether it is true I do not know – that the US congress had rejected President Bush's amount for aid for Iraq."
"They have cut it in half, saying that half the amount could be provided as grants, but the other half would have to be in the form of loans."
"This information needs to be checked, but it is what I was told this morning."
"If we do not vote the EUR 500 million, and EUR 200 million is the final figure that the Commission settles upon, Commissioner Patten has also said that should that funding be spent rapidly and efficiently, then the Commission would come back with a supplementary and amending budget."
"I would ask Mrs Schreyer if she can confirm that."
"It is essential to know – before the vote on Thursday – whether, if the EUR 200 million is agreed by Parliament and then spent quickly, the Commission will come back and provide more money next year, based on needs."
"Let us not forget that if the EUR 500 million is rejected then our position is EUR 30 million."
"Then, of course, we would have to look at the proposal for the EUR 200 million and I would hope that, if the EUR 500 million is rejected, we do not decide that EUR 30 million is the amount to which we are totally committed."
"I would hope that all the political groups opt for the maximum of EUR 200 million, albeit spread over two years."
"Let us not forget that a codecision agreement is still needed and that the Council will also have to agree to that figure."
"Then comes the hard bargaining during conciliation as to where the money will come from."
"If we are naive enough to believe that it will all come from flexibility, then we will have some long nights in conciliation when the matter has to be negotiated."
"Mr President, as several people have said, this year is of course the first time that we are working with a budget designed to be activity-based, the idea being that the budget should be far better at reflecting the political priorities and that it should also be easier to see where we are investing our money."
"I think, however, that we are failing fully to notice the improvement this year, because, as has been seen from today’s debate, we still of course have the budget divided up into areas of expenditure and we still have to keep within the fixed limits for these areas of expenditure. This means that the budget work is still a very technical exercise in which it is easy to lose sight of the political choices."
"It is of course important, among other things, that we see the agencies’ – the decentralised agencies’ – budgets in the context of the political priorities."
"It is of course true to say that we in the EU are acquiring more and more decentralised agencies, each individual one of which is to fulfil tasks with high political priorities, such as food safety or the approval of medicines."
"We must beware that establishing the decentralised agencies does not lead to unduly high expenditure for the EU, but we must of course also ensure that these agencies have the financial frameworks to enable the tasks in actual fact to be carried out. That is why it is important for us to have obtained the activity-based budget."
"I also very much agree with Mr Mulder’s demand that we acquire greater transparency and the ability on the part of Parliament to control the agencies’ budgets."
"I have a couple more individual points to make."
"I should like, where this year’s budget is concerned, to emphasise that, in connection with enlargement, we have appropriated more money to guarantees for loans."
"This may strengthen the European Investment Bank’s and the European Development Bank’s work on developing the banking sector in the new Member States, and I believe that, in return for very few resources, we shall obtain a very large dispersal effect and shall be able to obtain considerable economic growth, in the way we have heard about during the hearings in the Committee on Budgets on the work of the two banks."
"Last but not least, I hope we can find a solution to the problem of the information offices, or what are known as Info-Points and Carrefour centres, which, as from next year, have had their subsidies cut back because of problems with the Financial Regulation."
"I hope that we can find a solution and that the Commission will help us find a solution."
"Mr President, the 2004 budget will be the first budget for the enlarged Europe."
"It is a good opportunity to welcome the ten new Member States, even if it remains the case that the drastic conditions of membership have imposed shock treatment upon their populations."
"I wish, however, to stick to one question at the present time: is this budget equal to the challenges that the EU should now be taking up in the interests of a fairer world, characterised by greater solidarity?"
"It is permitted to have doubts and worries."
"I am thinking in the very first place of Palestine."
"What is Europe’s ambition faced with the deterioration in the conditions of life in the occupied Palestinian territories and with the extent of the destruction of the basic infrastructure, in particular that funded by Europe?"
"One amendment by my group therefore requests the Commission to assess the growing needs of the Palestinian population and to create a specific budget line for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the territories administered by the National Palestinian Authority."
"That, I think, would be a strong political signal at a time when Sharon’s policy is aimed, above all, at delegitimising the claims to a Palestinian state, without which, however, no peace will be possible."
"In the same spirit, my group is pleased about the introduction of an amendment by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, designed to guarantee aid to the people of the Western Sahara and to make sure that it is not interrupted."
"Aid to Iraq will constitute one of the important points of the budget."
"The issue of credits for the country’s reconstruction enables us, once again, to send out a strong political signal. Is the basic problem, however, that of the amount of the aid, whether it be EUR 200 million or EUR 500 million?"
"I do not think so."
"The urgent issue is to put an end to the occupation."
"Political aid, enabling the Iraqi people to recover their sovereignty and freedom of action as quickly as possible, is a prerequisite of their being able themselves to put figures to their needs and to organise the means for satisfying them."
"Let us not in fact be fooled by the hidden face of American aid which, for its part, is in any case calculated in billions."
"The Bush administration’s desire is, firstly, to open the door to the US enterprises that, as announced at a recent meeting, are already poised to do business in Iraq."
"It certainly intends fully to exploit the legislation that at present authorises foreign companies to acquire 100% of the shares in the various sectors of the Iraqi economy."
"Is that the way in which it will be possible to satisfy the country’s huge needs?"
"In saying that, I am thinking of the whole range of collective services, from the water supply to electricity, taking in education, social services and health."
"I do not think that is the way."
"The idea that the funds should be administered by the American Federal Reserve therefore remains unacceptable."
"The Commissioner speaks of the need to improve security in Iraq."
"As long, however, as the sovereignty of the Iraqi people is scorned, none of the problems will be resolved."
"The vote on the last resolution, 1511, of the Security Council witnesses to a symbolic Franco-German climb-down on this subject, symbolic of European nervousness in the face of American pressure."
"The EU would, however, benefit by speaking up more clearly in favour of strict respect for the interests of the Iraqi people, so that they might regain their dignity as quickly as possible, and in favour, at a budgetary level, of a multilateral fund of special allocations in which the United Nations would finally have its rightful place."
"In this connection, the voice of the Iraqis needs to be heard."
"The Iraqi people must, as quickly as possible, play a part in the reconstruction and democratisation of their country."
"Europe would benefit from being a partner in the process and a party to it."
"Mr President, I should like to add my tribute for the huge amount of work that has been put into the process of the budget so far by the rapporteurs, coordinators and indeed the chairman of the committee."
"I welcome much of the output of the committee so far."
"In one of the smaller budget lines they proposed an increase for town twinning."
"I would invite the Commission to put an end to the annual skirmish on this subject and accept that this is a budget line that is relatively small but very keenly felt, appreciated and depended upon by many Community organisations."
"On agriculture and rural development, I support the idea of increasing aid to less-favoured areas where agricultural production faces very serious and particular challenges in economic terms."
"I would like to encourage, in general, moves to boost rural development to get a more appropriate targeting of available resources in rural areas from EU funding, while ensuring that the incentives are there in order to encourage the rearing of livestock and the growing of crops by the most natural methods possible."
"On fisheries, I am very disappointed that the Council seemed so unwilling to fund adequately its own CFP reform programme."
"I am particularly disappointed that Parliament's proposal to provide an additional EUR 150 million to address some of the serious economic and social consequences of the current crisis in white-fish- dependent areas has been blocked by Member States, in particular the UK Government."
"I agree with those who have commented upon the idiotic proposal to award ourselves additional taxi allowances outwith the budgetary process."
"I do not see how that particular idea is going to help the reputation of this establishment or make a contribution to activity-based budgeting."
"Mr President, I would like to address one particular aspect of the draft general budget for 2004 in so far as it relates to the work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, of which I am a member."
"I should also like to compliment Mr Mulder on his work."
"In relation to agricultural expenditure, I fully agree that more emphasis must be placed on the environment, food safety, traceability, animal welfare and consumer information."
"All these aspects will come to the fore even more in the coming years through the recently-reformed common agricultural policy."
"Our consumers expect European agriculture to deliver on these multifunctional aspects, and our farmers are prepared to do this."
"We know that there are extra costs involved vis-à-vis our trading partners, but it is a price the European taxpayer is prepared to pay for peace of mind."
"This is what we mean when we refer to the European model of agriculture and rural development."
"It is well worth defending, particularly in the context of the WTO."
"Animal welfare is an area that concerns all in the sector."
"To those colleagues who are seeking to eliminate export refunds for live cattle, I would ask them again to consider the trade implications of what they are suggesting."
"The proper forum for dealing with this issue is the WTO, where the EU must ensure that there is a level playing field."
"'Unilateral trade disarmament' is unacceptable."
"We cannot stop supporting our farmers while the Americans and others continue with their export-enhancing schemes."
"I am as interested in animal welfare as the next man, as indeed are all farmers, and all those involved in the live export trade."
"It is in the financial interests of the producer and the exporter that the animals arrive in tip-top condition."
"There will always be demand for live cattle exports."
"If we in Europe do not take up market opportunities in the Middle East and elsewhere, our competitors from Australia and New Zealand will ship their animals half way around the world to meet that particular demand."
"Mr President, since I only have very little time, I shall concentrate on three points: subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the administrative expenses of the Environment DG, and Natura 2000."
"In my opinion, the draft budget anticipates the reform of the common organisation of the market in tobacco, planned for 2005."
"As for the overall reform – the talk now is of totally decoupling aid and no longer of simply adjusting the current system – this should not take place before 2005."
"Tobacco cultivation remains a distinctive sector of activity, affecting 110 000 families and generating 400 000 seasonal jobs."
"Reducing or abolishing tobacco subsidies would entail the disappearance of small family businesses dotting the European landscape and would open wide the doors of the European market to American producers."
"It would be undesirable in terms of the environment and of national and regional development, and it would be bad for the health of our fellow citizens, who would not stop smoking because of such measures."
"As for the administrative expenses of DG 11, these are increasing exponentially, rising from EUR 58 million in 2002 to EUR 83 million in 2004."
"That is a huge rise of 43% in two years."
"All that to increase the number of civil servants responsible for noting breaches of environmental legislation."
"If these breaches represent 45% of current business, it is because the Community regulations are unwieldy, ill adapted and difficult to implement."
"As in the case of Natura 2000, they are contrary to the will of the people, as France pointed out at the Environmental Council in June 2003."
"That being said, is it necessary to create a technical assistance department endowed with EUR 3 million, which would sort out neither the difficulty of implementation nor the funding after 2006?"
"In our view, this department would be a source of further confusion for people, who already have difficulty making sense of all the roles devolved to each level: Community, national and regional."
"Does not, however, the Commission wish, in this way, to have a stranglehold on the implementation of this Habitat directive, which does not fall within its competence?"
"Because of all these issues, we shall not vote in favour of this budget."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, changes, or new features, have clearly been added to the European budget for 2004: it has been described as a budget for a Europe of twenty-five, with a new nomenclature, based on activities, objectives and targets."
"This does not necessarily make the budget easier reading when, for example, we have 215 activities instead of the distinction previously made between administrative and operational expenditure."
"Furthermore, we will soon also have the new feature that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure will be removed and, one of these days, we will see the budgetisation of the European Development Fund (EDF)."
"When that day comes, however, will we in this House still be able to complete a discussion on the matter in two hours as well as take a vote on EUR 100 billion’s worth of spending?"
"There is, therefore, a deficit in budgetary democracy, ample proof of which is the fact that this Chamber is completely empty!"
"There are also other budgetary deficits, first of all in the reliability of the forecasts."
"There are the figures for outstanding commitments: between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion of unused appropriations each year, and this is a problem, especially when, on top of this, we do not have enough money to give to beekeepers, sheep farmers, fishermen, and so on."
"There is also a deficit in budgetary justice: year after year – this is a truism – Europe has its winners and its losers and they are always the same people!"
"The Spain of Mr Aznar, who preaches to the whole world about budgetary balance, receives royalties worth EUR eight billion every year and without this income Spain would enjoy no budgetary balance at all."
"At the same time, other countries that form a majority, pay up – France and Germany, for example."
"In France, we lose between EUR 2 and EUR 4 billion every year, which is the equivalent of one TGV line every year!"
"Something is clearly wrong!"
"There is also a deficit in the hierarchy of budgetary priorities: it is all well and good to earmark EUR 200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq, to give another EUR 200 million to Afghanistan, and EUR 240 million to Turkey to cover pre-accession costs, but should these really be priorities when the whole of Europe has only EUR 600 million in 2004, with which it can build the equivalent of a few kilometres of TGV line?"
"Should we be spending EUR 640 million on Afghanistan, Turkey and Iraq – which nobody forced us to destroy – when we cannot even build high-speed rail links or major transport networks?"
"The budget contains a perversion of solidarity, which in turn reveals a fourth deficit; a deficit of coherence."
"This is a Europe that, at Lisbon, stated its desire to be the number one world power in the field of knowledge, which Nikita Khrushchev wanted for his country as long ago as 1960, in order to beat the United States."
"This is a Europe of Erasmus Mundus, which wants to be a global university, a Europe of major works Pericles, a Europe of universal external policy, a Shiva with one thousand arms, in Cotonou or Mercosur, in Asia, in South Africa, ‘everything but arms’, for the poor and even for the rich."
"And yet, this Europe of global dimensions has a truly provincial budget of EUR 100 billion, in other words, one per cent of its GDP, and this percentage is not increasing."
"Given the contradiction between these global ambitions and this laughable budget, the question is raised as to where the truth about Europe lies."
"The answer is to be found in the budgets: year after year, Europe churns out impressive-sounding speeches which, in reality, fall considerably short of what is needed."
"Madam President, we have indeed been set challenges by our two rapporteurs, but I would like to focus on three issues in particular: enlargement, Commission reform and, last but not least, Iraq."
"I fully accept, as does my Group, that the major goal for this budget as set out by Mr Mulder is enlargement."
"From the outset we wanted to ensure that a full budget will be available for the new Member States, and that the commitments will be effectively implemented."
"We still realise, however, there will be many difficulties ahead as regards the day-to-day running of an EU with 25 Member States, particularly where translation and interpretation are concerned."
"This leads me to reform."
"In my Group we believe that as far as the reform of the Commission is concerned, we really need to make sure that there are signs that something has changed since 1999."
"We have therefore put the 272 posts in reserve."
"One of our main conditions is that an assessment be carried out of the changes that have occurred and the action that still needs to be taken."
"The Eurostat affair and the issues concerning whistleblowers and the position of OLAF show that the Commission is slow to tackle things."
"We would like to see the latter issue raised as a separate discussion on the basis of an oral question in the November part-session in Strasbourg."
"As other speakers have highlighted in this afternoon's debate, it seems to our Group that Iraq is the major issue for our budget in 2004."
"I thank those who have had the courage to speak in favour of our amendment."
"There are three reasons for this: first, for us, this is a major political signal to the outside world that Europe is prepared to play a significant role in humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Iraq."
"Although Iraq is different from Afghanistan, we have given EUR 1 billion to Afghanistan over a five-year period, and, if we take into account the Commission proposal, we have given EUR 200 million to Iraq over an indefinite period."
"However, I read in – presumably one of Mr Wynn's favourite newspapers – that the Japanese Government has pledged USD 5 billion over several years for Iraq's reconstruction in contrast to our EUR 200 million."
"Second, in the light of last week's unanimous vote in the UN and 's revelation that the US has agreed to allow a joint UN Development Programme/World Bank agency to administer the funds, it is now easier for us in Europe to think of allocating more funds for Iraq's reconstruction."
"It should be recognised, Mr Walter, that certain countries will be less enthusiastic because of their position on the war, but I understand that the page has turned, and that those who are forward-looking in our Parliament – and indeed those who support America in its hour of need – will be supporting the PPE-DE Group's amendment."
"Lastly, we believe that this particular amendment is not incompatible with financing other areas, and will not affect existing funding – the amendment itself mentions this."
"Mr Wynn, you commented that the Commission proposal is not based on assessments, it is based on availability."
"We believe that the monies will be needed for 2004."
"You also mentioned that this is a first reading."
"We should actually be able to vote our amendment quite within the bounds of the financial perspective and should our amendment fall, we as a Group will, of course, reserve our right to consider whether the Commission's proposal is the right one."
"Therefore, in this budget we want to prepare the Union for enlargement, we want to make sure that reforms of the institutions are carried out, but above all we want a Europe which is going to play its role in the world."
"That is why we ask the House to support our amendment earmarking EUR 500 million for Iraq."
"– Madam President, this is the last budget this Parliament will approve and therefore perhaps the last one many of us will vote on."
"I therefore believe this is a good time to assess our budgetary work throughout this legislature and I confess that my assessment is not wholly favourable."
"We would like just to focus on positive aspects, such as the improvements in the budgetary procedure, the functioning of our own Committee on Budgets and the achievement of the first review of the financial perspectives since 1993."
"But we must not forget that the proportion the budget represents in relation to GDP has been reduced, and this is clearly insufficient in view of the Union’s objectives, and paradoxically, each year there is a surplus of appropriations as a result of poor implementation."
"I believe it is the duty of both the Commission and Parliament to express its opinion on the future financial perspectives so that the next Commission and the next Parliament can use them as a basis for their considerations."
"Despite its miserly size, the Union’s budget appears all-encompassing and I thank the general rapporteur for his cooperation in fitting in all our various requests."
"We note that everything from the protection of hazelnut cultivation to a pilot project for helping victims of terrorism has been included."
"I would like to stress that the regulations on COMs and on the Structural Funds must be complied with and the budget is not the correct stage of the procedure to amend them."
"Now, if there is one star issue, one objective, ladies and gentlemen, in this 2004 budget, I believe it is preparing the Union for enlargement, for the integration of 10 new States and, based on my experience of having been myself an observer in a candidate country – some years ago now – my prediction is that the integration will be a success."
"I would add my thanks, in particular, to Parliament for its tenacity and ambition, since the Council’s first reaction was more worthy of obsessive accountants than of politicians aware of the historic challenge facing us: the greatest and most difficult enlargement ever undergone as part of the project of European integration."
"The Council tried to have everything tied up, refused to review the financial perspectives for several months and has also refused to include the 25 from 1 January."
"I believe that would have been a political gesture worthy of consideration."
"Nevertheless, in an almost unprecedented display of frivolity and political demagoguery, some people have tried to cast a shadow over this central objective of the budget by presenting an unjustified amendment which would add EUR 500 million to the appropriations already planned for Iraq."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have approved, and on Thursday we are going to approve in plenary session, EUR 100 million in humanitarian aid for that country."
"The European Commission is asking for, and can only justify, EUR 160 million for 2004 for the Community contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq."
"I can guarantee that many millions of European citizens who opposed this illegal war, which did not have the support of United Nations, do not understand why the European Union has to provide anything other than humanitarian aid in Iraq."
"I can guarantee that it will be very difficult for me to explain this to my citizens – very difficult – and the only way I can understand this amendment is as a reflection of a desire to clear a bad conscience after having supported an illegal war."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no justification for this."
"The only thing we can justify – now there is a United Nations Resolution – is to contribute to what the Commission is proposing to us in a reasonable manner."
"Furthermore, I would also like to ask – and I know that Mr Salafranca is about to speak – where the honourable Members from the European People's Party are going to get it from."
"From Latin America?"
"From Asia?"
"From Africa?"
"From the Mediterranean?"
"Where are you going to get it from?"
"Because you are perfectly aware that there are no appropriations anywhere, even by stretching the flexibility instrument to its limits."
"I would therefore ask you to be responsible and aware and to withdraw the amendment, in order that we do not make fools of ourselves and so that the European Union may have a budget which makes it capable of dealing with enlargement and which brings peace."
"Madam President, on the eve of the donor conference on Iraq, I, as the budget rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, would like to endorse the Commission’s realistic proposals to release a further EUR 200 million for the reconstruction of Iraq on top of the EUR 100 million of humanitarian aid previously promised."
"Anyone in favour of more European money for reconstruction must go and argue and must knock on the doors of the Member States."
"As a matter of fact, it surprises me that countries that at the time were very enthusiastic advocates of a military intervention in Iraq are today willing only to release very limited funds or even no funds at all for its reconstruction."
"It is plain cynical to have to conclude that certain donors want to advance loans to Iraq as if the debt burden of the Iraqi people were not already high enough."
"The conditions laid down by the European Union for a financial contribution for reconstruction are a ."
"The central role of the UN must be strengthened."
"The European money must therefore only be deposited in a new Trust Fund to be set up by the UN and the World Bank."
"Secondly, the aid must not be spent exclusively on large-scale construction projects that are made to measure for companies that have good relations with the White House."
"Thirdly, I am also arguing for 35% of the annual credits to be used for elementary health care and primary education."
"Whatever, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy does not wish to see funds for the reconstruction of Iraq being at the expense of other commitments of the Union, such as those with regard to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Latin America."
"Failing to make good on agreements made would seriously harm the credibility and the reliability of our foreign policy and for me that is far more important than the political rearguard actions in this Parliament."
"Madam President, the 2004 budget is an expression of the anti-grass roots, autocratic policy of the European Union."
"For yet another year, a budget is being presented which strengthens big business and the expansionist imperialist policy of the European Union."
"The restriction on the budget items to less than 1% of Community GDP, especially in a year in which it is being called upon to fund not 15 but 25 countries, with enhanced convergence requirements, throws into relief the picture of the promotion of plans to restructure, privatise and liberalise the markets and of the indifference towards the needs of the workers, the poor and the small and medium-sized urban and rural classes, who are being called on to pay the price of the crisis."
"The general guidelines for the European Union budget for 2004 consist of cutting spending for the Structural Funds and limiting funding for the CAP so that the repressive and aggressive European defence and security policy can be funded on the pretext of fighting terrorism and addressing immigration and creating and funding repressive mechanisms, such as the European army, police and border guards, the central personal records system and so on."
"The murder of Palestinians by Israel is being funded under the agreements and the invasion of the USA in Iraq is being funded and legitimised."
"The austerity imposed on the workers and working classes in order to serve the interests of the monopolies is being continued under the Lisbon philosophy, with more intense exploitation, violation of workers' employment and insurance rights, rising unemployment, the destruction of the environment and the continuing commercialisation of health, education and social welfare."
"The pompous statements on economic and social conversion are categorically refuted by this budget, which presents no substantial redistribution of income to the less developed areas and the working classes suffering from unemployment, underemployment and poverty."
"Quite the contrary!"
"Any convergence happening is happening downwards, dragging even broader sections of society into poverty and penury."
"The cutbacks in Community spending on agriculture, within the framework of the philosophy of the WTO and in agreement with the USA, come within the anti-farming framework of the partial reform of the CAP."
"At the same time, restructuring is being imposed and pressure is being exerted for alternative crops, such as for tobacco cultivation and other Mediterranean products in which the European Union has a deficit, while genetically-modified organisms are being promoted under pressure from the Americans and its multinationals."
"The budget is funding the extermination of small and medium-sized farming."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against this budget because, instead of resolving, it will create new problems for the workers, farmers and small enterprises in the regions and instead of contributing to peace in the world, it promotes war and the imperialist hegemony."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to draw Parliament’s attention, as the budgetary authority, to two lines of financial aid which are different to those mentioned recently."
"The first is the line for projects of common interest for the trans-European transport networks."
"The Treaty of Maastricht gave the Community the task of contributing to the creation and development of trans-European infrastructure networks for transport, telecommunications and energy."
"These networks fall within the framework of the general objective of social and economic cohesion."
"In this regard, on 9 October the Commission presented to the Council of Ministers its new proposal containing a statement of projects of European interest."
"It is a very ambitious proposal, but it does not have the necessary resources."
"I am therefore proposing in an amendment that priority must be given to sea and river transport, rail and cross-border connection projects, but, above all, to those projects to which the Member States are already committing significant resources."
"For the latter, please refer to the Van Miert report, presented on 30 June 2003, because there are many other projects which have been on the table since the Essen European Council in 1994 and today, nine years later, they have yet to be dealt with."
"I therefore suggest that the Commission should demand the cancellation or even return of the aid allocated to an action in the event that that action has not been completed within 10 years of its approval."
"Nevertheless, the Commission would have the power not to apply that time limit in the case of an extraordinarily large project or an unexpected delay."
"Secondly, tourism will soon be the European Union's most important service industry."
"The World Tourism Organisation expects the number of tourist arrivals to double, to approximately 720 million a year in 2020, and the 9 million people for whom it provides work will increase by between 2 and 3.5 million, to 12.5 million jobs."
"We therefore proposed that resources be allocated at European level to assist the promotion, monitoring and assessment of an ecologically and socially sustainable tourism policy, which, however, was rejected."
"I trust that, in the future, the Constitutional Treaty will consider this activity as a Community objective, because it affects all of us, service providers and users."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a couple of points arising from the Budget for 2004 that I would like to single out."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether it really thinks it makes sense, now, at the beginning of the new year, to cease to provide funding for the Euro Info Centres, the Carrefours, or, indeed, town twinning."
"I find myself wondering even now whether the Commission really thinks it has such a good image in the eyes of Europe’s people that it can afford to do without the few who are working for Europe in these areas."
"I really am slowly coming to wonder about that."
"The fact is that we, not only in our capacities as MEPs, never stop trying to advance these things and to motivate them, yet the Commission does nothing about making immediate arrangements for the funding of these bodies to be continued."
"This, I think, is where it should do something as soon as possible to enable us to fund – let me say it again – the Euro Info Centres, the network of Carrefours, and also town twinning arrangements."
"If you no longer have the people on your side, you will soon be very alone, and the Commission will find that far from pleasant."
"Let me take up another issue, that of the agencies."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats proposed that 10% be put in reserve for these, and thank God that was accepted."
"This is about making it possible for the agencies to be monitored."
"We have seen all this happening before in many other areas. We will see to it that adequate controls are ensured in the agencies in the future."
"Let me add something political."
"Up to now, I have assumed that category 3 exists to fund internal policies."
"There are already over ten agencies in this area, and I really am slowly losing the desire to fund more and more administration using the parts of the Budget that are actually meant to be for political activities."
"This category is for funding policies rather than red tape, and that should be set out clearly."
"There is only one thing I would wish to add to the great deal that Mr Elles had to say on the subject of Iraq."
"It is that those of our fellow-Members from other groups who are already calling for a supplementary budget should be honest enough to vote in favour of our amendment and thus enable us to have sufficient funds available for the whole of 2004 and not have to ask for additional funds in six months’ time."
"I do believe that a true and transparent budget involves it being specified at the beginning of each year just how much money is available."
"For my final point, I would like to address myself to the Council."
"Last November, we expended a great deal of effort, between first and second reading, on negotiations towards extending Parliament’s right to be consulted on the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I am disappointed by the way that three Council Presidencies have told us that this resolution would, at last, be activated if we were to give EUR 10 million for the Police Mission."
"Let me make it perfectly plain that what this boils down to is that either we agree to something, or the negotiations are stalled."
"It really is a pretty poor state of affairs if the Council thinks it can wrest something from us by making promises in respect of something that has already been agreed."
"I would also like to point out that our group has always called for funding for this Police Mission."
"I do not actually have the time to thank the rapporteurs, which is what I wanted to do, but I will do it all the same."
"Thank you very much!"
"– Madam President, with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation, the subsidies of the former Part A and some of them from the former Part B of the Budget, which did not have basic instruments, required those basic instruments to be adopted in order to be implemented."
"To this end, the Commission presented seven basic instruments which are currently under discussion in five parliamentary committees."
"The initial objective was that they would be approved for the action programmes to enter into force from 2004."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for the seven proposals, I can only deplore the Commission's delay in presenting them, because this means that the various Parliamentary committees involved are also working behind schedule and against the clock, and this makes it difficult for us to respect the strengthened cooperation between committees which is applicable for this procedure."
"Furthermore, we must also remember that some of the proposals pose particular difficulties, as in the case of pre-allocations, amongst other things."
"In addition, if we bear in mind that the various competent working groups in the Council are also significantly behind schedule, as well as the difficulties we are expecting in terms of reaching a consensus between Council and Parliament – four of the proposals involve the codecision procedure – we must recognise, as realists, that the outlook is not very encouraging and that it may, therefore, be very difficult to fulfil the compromise which Parliament and the Council reached in the conciliation of 16 July so that these legal bases could be adopted before the end of 2003."
"The Committee on Budgets, by means of the Mulder report, requests, Commissioner, that the European Commission provide for the implementation of exceptional transitional measures which allow subsidies to be allocated during 2004, as laid down in the presentation of its proposals."
"Regardless of the final result, therefore, in the basic instruments relating to the issue of pre-allocations, at first reading the Committee on Budgets has maintained the pre-allocation in the corresponding lines for the 2004 budget, as was done in previous years."
"All this will allow the various associations to be able to benefit from subsidies in 2004 under the same conditions applicable until now."
"Above all, however, the rapporteur believes that, if we can have a transitional period, we will be better able to prepare the negotiations for the conciliation procedure with the Council, as well as the second reading, and not once again be slaves to the timetable; otherwise, not only will the rigour and responsibility required of this institution be prejudiced, because we are legislating, but, in particular, so will the action programmes and their beneficiaries."
"– Madam President, I will make a few comments in relation to heading 4."
"I have always argued that the tasks of reconstruction, rehabilitation, pacification and democratisation in Iraq must not be the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but that they fall within the competence, or should fall within the competence, of the international democratic community."
"Moreover, this Parliament, Mr Colom i Naval, will decide democratically on the amount it wishes to allocate to this priority, and the Committee on Budgets has already decided on it."
"Our political group believes that this contribution must be as ambitious as possible, but also that it should not prejudice other geographical areas."
"This has been stated in the resolution approved by this Parliament, Madam President."
"Mr Elles has already explained quite correctly how this priority can be funded without prejudicing other geographical areas."
"Further to that, I would like to point out that the plan to reduce other policies does not originate from this Parliament, which has increased external action, but was the niche prepared by the Commission precisely in order to fund this priority of Iraq."
"Madam President, I would simply like to make a clear demand and draw the Commission’s attention to the fact that this Parliament wishes to fully exercise its budgetary competences, and I would like to refer specifically to a decision which has been taken by the Committee on Budgets in relation to a fund for regional solidarity between Europe and Latin America."
"The European Council has established very clear conclusions on the situation in Bolivia."
"This Parliament is going to hold a debate tomorrow and adopt a resolution and, therefore, Commissioner, I would like to remind you that this Parliament wishes to fully exercise its responsibilities as an arm of the budgetary authority and behave like a Parliament which debates, which rejects, which ratifies and rectifies, and which does not wish to be – as Mr Dell’Alba said – an NGO or an accountant, but which wishes to fully exercise its responsibilities in accordance with its competences, according to the Treaties."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say something about the general lines on the agencies, which I have agreed with the general rapporteur in my capacity as permanent rapporteur on the agencies’ budget."
"Apart from one small change, we have, in dealing with this year’s agencies budget, followed the Commission proposal and have, as a rule, reinstated the Commission’s preliminary draft budget in order to take into account the agencies’ increased requirements in consequence of enlargement."
"It should be noted in this regard that some agencies have done very well out of this, whilst the reinstatement of the preliminary draft budget has meant that others have not received the funding they need in order to successfully complete the tasks allocated to them."
"We must nonetheless hold fast to the principle that it is the budget that determines activities and not the other way round."
"It is not acceptable for the administrative boards or managers of agencies to exceed their budgets without obtaining approval for this from the Commission or the budgetary authority."
"As regards the agencies’ establishment plan and Mr Mulder’s proposal concerning it, I would like to point out that Parliament, being part of the budgetary authority, must get better at monitoring the agencies’ personnel policies, to which certain principles must apply."
"Firstly, and as a rule, the agency must, when recruiting staff, use the procedures generally customary in the EU."
"Secondly, when recruiting specialised staff, who can only be allocated to higher grades, approval must be sought from the budgetary authority in each individual case."
"Thirdly, agencies must not grant established official status without the budgetary authority’s permission."
"The object of this is to enable us to eventually get some sort of grip on the expansion of personnel and the inflation of costs."
"As the Member States have already announced their intention to set up even more agencies, we can see even today that this will go beyond the scope of category 3."
"I would ask the Commissioner to join with her fellow-Commissioners in giving some thought to whether it might not make sense to establish a category specifically for the agencies, enabling control of them to be improved and made transparent, and also guaranteeing Parliament’s right of co-determination."
"– Madam President, first of all, I, too, should like to thank Mr Mulder for the work he has done with such great balance and commitment that it has achieved a substantial consensus within the Committee on Budgets."
"The 2004 budget is very much a continuation of the 2003 structure."
"The main objective for next year is to provide sufficient funds and a sufficiently well-structured system to cope with not only the challenge of enlargement but also the new responsibilities that an enlarged Europe will have to take on on the world stage."
"I should like to focus on just a few points, because many things have already been said."
"I would mention, in particular, the support that Parliament is reserving for the reconstruction effort in Iraq, especially after the recent UN vote; the confirmation of its commitment to Afghanistan and the reaffirmation that ongoing programmes must be supported and maintained, despite the current difficulties; and the principle whereby aid to developing countries should be precisely targeted, especially in the case of priority objectives such as combating poverty."
"I therefore feel it is essential to ensure that the Tacis, LRRD and MEDA programmes are preserved, and I see a need for a new instrument to update the policy of proximity and to put it into practice."
"Lastly, I would mention the protection and promotion of children, especially those who are victims of wars and natural disasters."
"Finally, I should also like to thank the Commission, which has, once again, been extremely open to working with the Committee on Budgets, and I hope that, by next year, we will have succeeded in this challenge."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, members of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, the Budget resolutions are about setting down in figures the policy that one wants to implement; it is about turning one’s own political priorities into a proper structure of figures that will stand up."
"This year, my group, that of the Party of European Socialists, has again been successful in playing its part in this."
"We agreed, early on in the year 2000, that we would make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, with qualified full employment and greater social cohesion."
"This, the Lisbon objective, is our guiding star, and we must not lose sight of it even when we are fighting over the many minor lines in the Budget."
"It is precisely there, among these rather minor lines, that we find expenditure on our action plans, ‘Europe 2002’ and its offshoot, ‘Europe 2005’, which are meant to prevent regions and people from being left behind by the headlong developments in our information society."
"In this regard, it is also important that we should have sufficient funds available to be able to promptly and effectively integrate the new information and communications technologies into Europe’s education and training systems."
"Not only does Learning, a multiannual programme, work towards social cohesion and towards bridging the digital divide, but it also improves opportunities for lifelong learning and enhances the European dimension in education, and that is something we need."
"We need people to be innovative and mobile, people who are capable of putting the new technologies to work in innovative production processes."
"Innovation creates new jobs, most frequently in small and medium-sized enterprises, support for which needs to be further stepped up."
"We know that small and medium-sized enterprises employ over half the EU’s workers, that they produce something like half the total turnover in the European Union, and that they are innovative and geared towards growth."
"All this adds up to sufficient reason for a Social Democrat like myself to keep harping on about the importance of support for SMEs, whether this be by implementing the lines for action from the Charter for Small Enterprises, by helping SMEs to put new technologies to good use, or by improving their financial environment."
"In all this, we have to pay particular attention to the very small firms, the micro-enterprises, even though the Commission is proving to be a bit clumsy about this."
"The fact is that they make up the majority of our businesses."
"Our average SME employs five people."
"From this moment on, we need to make greater efforts towards achieving the targets we set ourselves in Lisbon, indeed much greater efforts in view of our having twenty-five, rather than only fifteen, Member States, from May next year."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, and the rapporteur, Mrs Gill, on the excellent work they have done."
"I am convinced that the 2004 budget is going to contribute to the success of the Union’s most crucial enlargement and, despite what we have heard here this afternoon, I also maintain the hope – because that is the last thing we lose – that in terms of the budget we will reconcile the profound differences we have suffered in relation to the action in Iraq."
"I would like to say something on another fundamental issue, however: immigration."
"Immigration is no longer a national issue, and has become a European issue, including the most dramatic aspects of it."
"It is essential to dedicate more resources to this political priority."
"We need to improve border control, combat illegal immigration effectively, which leaves victims on our coasts almost every day, and we need countries of origin and transit to manage migratory flows effectively while respecting human rights."
"We therefore unreservedly support the increase in resources for programmes such as ARGOand we welcome the new programme of financial and technical aid to third countries in this field."
"Madam President, I believe it is very appropriate in this debate to stress, as other Members have done, that the 2004 budget creates a line intended to introduce elements of European solidarity into assistance for the victims of terrorism."
"This pilot project recognises in a special manner this group of European citizens and sends the political message that the Union is listening to them and is showing solidarity from a budgetary point of view as well."
"Finally, Madam President, the draft 2004 budget takes the Council's traditional approach of austerity and expenditure control."
"We agree that this budgetary policy must contribute to healthy and stable growth."
"Only if we are rigorous, if we opt for quality spending and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, will we reduce the gap between us and our most direct competitor, the United States."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, Council Representative, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to thank our two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the method they have used and for the quality of their work on this new budgetary framework."
"This has enabled us to vote on a budget for twenty-five countries, taking up the traditional budgetary priorities and Parliament’s constant concerns, relating specifically to our core traditional policies, but also to the concerns that we have been expressing for years on the subject of micro-enterprises, citizens’ information and policies of justice, security and solidarity."
"Having said that, the problems raised by the draft budget that the Council submitted to us do not bode well for the future, in particular the historically low level of payment appropriations: less than 1% of GDP, the likes of which we have to go back more than seventeen years to see."
"The Council, which is obsessed with the health of national economies, is acting like an accountant but certainly not like a manager and even less as if it had a vision for the European Union’s future."
"The discrepancy between the codecision agreements and what has been included in the budget, the discrepancy between the projects for economic recovery, the project for a knowledge-based society for all twenty-five countries and the reality of the budget sap the credibility of the Union as a whole."
"So what has happened to the spirit of Lisbon?"
"The EU budget does not match our ambition, or our expectations."
"This year, two headings fail to comply with the financial perspective."
"First, EUR 83 million too much has been earmarked for rural development, which highlights the needs created by the CAP’s new approach."
"Nevertheless, observing budgetary rigour, I propose that we give up this surplus and prepare better for the 2005 financial year."
"Let me now turn to external policy, where the problem is quite different. The Commission has made proposals for the reconstruction of Iraq that are reasonable and acceptable in budgetary terms."
"What is the point, then, of the proposal for EUR 500 million, apart from reviving splits that have cost us so much credibility on the international stage?"
"All Europeans should quickly find the path of realistic wisdom and mutual respect."
"Lastly, I wish to recall the importance for Parliament of policies for communicating with the citizens."
"The serious incident between the Commission and Europe’s information bodies weakens this policy and demonstrates the difficulties that the Commission has in respecting the priorities set by Parliament."
"The new financial regulation must not be called into question, as it allows for greater transparency in relations with the bodies that receive European subsidies."
"Having said that, the implementing arrangements endanger three hundred essential information organisations."
"It is therefore obvious that a solution must be found to ensure that their work can continue."
"This serious incident nevertheless warrants one fundamental observation: why did the Commission not warn us in time?"
"Like any administration, it has a duty to inform political representatives."
"This course of action was not taken even though it was stipulated in the confidence pact concluded during the implementation of the administrative reform."
"We voted in favour of giving confidence; we gave you the resources and in return we expected the promised effectiveness for the implementation of our political choices and particularly of our entire budget."
"This is an essential requirement if we are to be able, in future, to develop real policies of growth and solidarity and policies for the future in the context of an enlarged Union that wishes to succeed for the benefit of all its citizens."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder, for the excellent work they have done."
"We look forward to the continuing cooperation that we have had, both inside and outside this House."
"Secondly, I would like to mention that our committee wishes to maintain all its amendments at this stage, especially those relating to Eurostat."
"I would also like to welcome the PPE-DE Group's proposal for an oral question to the Commission for the November Strasbourg part-session about the appalling information flow in Eurostat, the problems involving whistleblowers, the audits that lay untouched in Eurostat and the lack of political responsibility in the Commission."
"We would also like to ensure that our amendments on the Committee of the Regions are maintained in the light of what we have just read in the OLAF report in the confidential reading room."
"The report says that, in the case of printing contracts, the investigation revealed systematic and flagrant incompetence within the Committee of the Regions."
"As regards the Financial Controller, the most threatening aspect for the Committee on the Regions seems to be the endemic culture of unprofessionalism and improvisation, where lack of transparency is preferred to openness, for instance in reporting facts to OLAF."
"The Committee of the Regions will have to answer some serious questions."
"If we had known those facts when the amendments concerning it were tabled, my committee would have made them more forceful, not only cutting some of the Committee of the Regions' budget, but putting a substantial additional amount into the reserve."
"We are also very keen to see the amendment tabled by Mr Bösch on the live export of animals adopted and I know that our rapporteurs are working actively to achieve that."
"I finish as I started by thanking the rapporteurs."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin, of course, by congratulating our rapporteurs, Mrs Gill and Mr Mulder."
"What I would like to say to you is this: we have on the table the last budget to be adopted in this Parliamentary term, and our minds are turning more and more towards the multiannual financial framework which will guide our budgetary policy in the medium and long term."
"The report ordered on this issue by President Prodi gives us some cause for concern, as, of course, does the crucial question of economic and social cohesion."
"The overriding feature of the budget of any federal state – which is increasingly what we want our budget to be – must be its redistributive function."
"In a democratic, politically coherent and socially responsible Europe, such redistribution can only be achieved if economic and social cohesion is the central aim."
"That, moreover, is the case in those Member States which have a more federal structure, such as Germany."
"The Sapir report is based on the premise that there is a conflict between cohesion and growth. To us, that premise seems ideologically motivated and unsound."
"Good cohesion policies are, by their nature, good economic growth policies, just as bad cohesion policies are also, by their nature, bad economic growth policies."
"What is worrying about the way the Community budget works at present is precisely that budgetary redistribution sometimes redounds to the benefit of more central countries or regions, and even large companies or multinationals."
"That tendency can be seen in product sale subsidies and export refunds."
"These are the areas which should be reviewed more thoroughly; these are the mechanisms and distortions which the next financial framework must tackle, and which must continue to act as the ultimate guiding principle of the Community budget."
"Madam President, I would also like to offer the rapporteurs my heartfelt thanks and with regard to social policy I would say that a number of problems do still remain."
"I am pleased that Mr Mulder’s programme for small and medium-sized businesses in Central and Eastern Europe can also be used for health and safety."
"I hope that he will confirm this, because otherwise the value of the programme is less than I had thought."
"I believe that fortunately this is not the case."
"So much for my first point."
"My second point is that of the celebrated 500 million."
"I have EUR 10 here in my hand and perhaps I can give them to the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Then they can offer them to the Conference in Madrid, they are just as much a pittance as the 200 million that they are willing to give at the moment."
"It is of course very bad that we say to a country that is in such difficulty, a country that in theory could be one of the richest countries in the world and that perhaps one day will be again, that we say to it: ‘No, we can give you 200 million,’ – although money is always given back by the European Commission at the end of the year – ‘More is out of the question and anyone who asks for more is behaving irresponsibly.’"
"Then it seems we are concerned with bookkeeping and not really with the resolution of problems."
"Sure enough, we can also put up EUR 10, then we are being even more responsible and then perhaps everything will be fine."
"However, I believe that we are then failing in our duty, that we are then acting as bookkeepers and not as politicians."
"However, we are meeting here in this Chamber as politicians and therefore we must also talk about the actual problems."
"It may of course be that there is some other reason, but we must be prepared to reveal what it is."
"I would very much like to hear what it is."
"Madam President, unfortunately, I could not resolve the problems of the Structural Funds with EUR 10."
"However, in all events, I must say, Commissioner, to start with this issue, that we in the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport consider that the Committee on Budgets has moved in the right direction as regards category II, the budget for the Structural Funds, by basically replacing the amounts set out in the preliminary draft budget and sometimes going higher."
"This was also our position when we gave our opinion on the budget and consequently there is no need for me to refer to this further."
"As far as transport is concerned, while I welcome the fact that the amounts in the preliminary draft budget for transport safety have been replaced – and for us the question of transport safety is a matter of absolute priority – I wish to say that we disagree with Amendment No 553 by the Committee on Budgets, which refers to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)."
"Here, in an effort to limit appropriations horizontally as far as personnel are concerned, I think that problems are being created for the ‘take-off’ of this agency, which needs to operate efficiently and quickly at European level, so that there is one contact for these issues with the Federal Aviation Administration (FΑΑ) in the United States."
"I think that the Committee on Budgets has gone further than it should have done on this specific issue."
"One last comment on the trans-European networks."
"We welcome the fact that the levels of the preliminary draft budget have been increased by 5 million for commitment appropriations and 52 million for payment appropriations."
"We would like to hope that these sums will be taken up."
"We would also like to believe that the Member States will honour the undertakings they have made, including recently at the last European Council in Brussels, to make the question of the European networks an absolute priority."
"Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposed a number of amendments to the budget."
"One main concern was with regard to the resources allocated to the various agencies and institutions that carry out statutory duties on our behalf or provide data and statistical information."
"We cannot demand that, for example, the European Environment Agency provide environmental indicators to enable us to link common agricultural policy reforms to the achievement of environmental goals if their budget is not adequate."
"Last year Parliament voted to allocate resources to help address the continuing health problems in the Republic of Belarus as a direct result of the Chernobyl incident of April 1986."
"Radiation affects 23% of the territory of Belarus."
"In the Gomel Oblast, which is contaminated, there are 2 million people, including 500 00 children."
"Rates of sickness have increased dramatically."
"For example, the number of children who suffer from thyroid cancer has increased fivefold."
"Most of the children were not even born at the time of the incident."
"In July I visited Belarus."
"I visited hospitals where they were trying to treat the casualties of the problem."
"I saw equipment that was 20 years out of date – radiotherapy equipment that was Soviet built and was broken down, with spares unavailable."
"Even if spares were available the government could not afford to repair them."
"They do not have access to the iridium sources needed for this equipment to work."
"So what have been the priorities of the European Union in the last 12 months in terms of spending?"
"We have spent EUR 180 million on the ridiculous pilgrimage to Strasbourg; we have wasted EUR 60 million on the Committee of the Regions – a talking shop that nobody listens to;"
"EUR 5 million have been nicked by corrupt officials in Eurostat."
"How much have we spent solving the health problems in Belarus?"
"Not one penny."
"We are told that the Commission intends to commission a study."
"That is not good enough."
"We need to address the problems in a country that is going to be on our borders in July next year."
"Madam President, I would also like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, on the way in which we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been able to work with him."
"We are not satisfied in every regard, but we have made good progress."
"We have a clear message for the Council."
"Because the interim reform of agriculture policy has very far-reaching consequences for the European countryside."
"Now that this reform is a fact it seems as if the Council, witness its draft budget, does not understand what the said reform actually means for farmers and country people in the European Union."
"What is being asked is that the countryside and agriculture be more market-driven and that more countryside policy lead to more dynamism in the countryside."
"If the European countryside wants to survive this reform, then it is advisable to use the money available more appropriately."
"After all, to give just one example, the average European dairy farmer alone gives up some EUR 6 000 in income per year."
"In my own country it is double that: EUR 12 000."
"Nor will the enlargement of the European Union have its intended effect."
"A new, longer external border makes the risks of epidemic animal diseases such as foot and mouth, swine fever and fowl pest greater."
"Add to this that the food safety, animal welfare and the environmental requirements in the European Union for the producer are the highest in the world, then we must have all hands on deck to structure the 2004 budget so that allowance is made for both the consumer and the farmer."
"Given the high ambition level of the European Union, a small consumer supplement on a number of products, such as milk and meat, would for that matter be very easy to defend."
"Madam President, as rapporteur for the agriculture budget I have on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development submitted the following change proposals for the treatment of this first reading."
"To begin with we would like to see more money being set aside for the LEADER programme."
"The same goes for the SAPAR programme, extremely important for our new Member States."
"We would also appreciate the introduction of a new budget line for the LEADER EAST programme."
"In addition, we want EUR 23 million extra for control and prevention."
"We would also like to see EUR 6 million extra for promotion payments by the Member States, in particular to give the market-driven policy more substance."
"In addition, EUR 1 million extra for promotion payments by the EU."
"With regard to the information supply for the amended agriculture policy, we would like to see 3 million extra being set aside."
"And in the area of animal diseases in particular we would like EUR 12 million extra to be set aside for veterinary measures and animal welfare and public health measures."
"We would also like EUR 18 million extra to be set aside for the animal diseases emergency fund."
"Madam President, when the previous budget debate was held in plenary at the end of September, I expressed concern about the reports on the irregularities at Eurostat."
"The Commission has since presented reports on the activities, but it is, however, unfortunate that these do not make clear what has happened and who is responsible."
"It is essential, in this connection, to emphasise the important role played by Eurostat in monetary union."
"The European Central Bank depends upon reliable statistics in order to be able to take its decisions on monetary policy."
"It is therefore extremely important for the irregularities to be investigated without delay and for correct procedural routines to be devised, so ensuring that Eurostat’s activities are focused upon producing statistics."
"I also believe it is time we began to conduct a more general debate on how the EU budget is really used."
"I should like to draw attention to some of the recommendations presented in what is known as the Sapir report, which observes very correctly that the EU budget is out-of-date."
"Expenditure, income and procedures are incompatible with the present and future situation."
"The report proposes, among other things, that the costs of agricultural and regional policy must be considerably reduced and that funds must be set aside from the budget in cases where they can create basic conditions for employment and growth."
"Everyone seems to agree about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises for economic growth."
"Action should also be taken to benefit such enterprises."
"In the future enlarged EU, it will be necessary drastically to cut back on agricultural aid, to reform structural funds and to create room for growth through private enterprise."
"Both the issue of Eurostat and that of how the EU budget is to look in the future are about credibility."
"If people are to have confidence in the EU, it is of fundamental importance that their money should be neither misappropriated nor squandered, but used in a sensible way that benefits people and development in the EU."
"Madam President, I too would like to add my thanks to Mr Mulder for the way he has carried out his work as budget rapporteur this year."
"I will be supporting the budget proposals for 2004, but with a certain amount of reluctance, and I will certainly be supporting amendments to them."
"In particular, I commend the amendments proposed by the Committee on Culture and ask Parliament to think of those organisations such as the youth parliaments and the Youth Orchestra, which do wonderful work for young people but need their funds to be paid in a prompt and efficient manner, something which is not always the case."
"I would particularly commend the remarks by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, and the Commission must get the legal base in order so that those funds can be paid next year promptly and on time."
"I think I am the last speaker from Parliament before the rapporteur and the Commission and I just want to make three fundamental points."
"The level of the European Union budget, at just over 1% of Europe's GDP, is about right."
"When I started my political life an elderly gentleman said to me 'always remember that when you put your hand up to vote for expenditure, you are actually putting it down into my pocket'."
"One penny in the pound is acceptable, one cent in the euro, but no more."
"Secondly, the Commission must get its accounts in order."
"All the good work done by European Union programmes is totally destroyed by these regular accounting problems."
"Is there not a single Commissioner prepared to accept responsibility for this and do the decent thing?"
"All the while they do not do so, the European Union is the loser."
"Finally, we must have proper democratic control."
"Last year, for instance, the budgetary authority voted EUR 3 million for Euronews."
"I heard only yesterday that to this day not a single cent of that money has been given to Euronews, which is one of the best ways for citizens in the European Union to find out about European affairs."
"I fear that the Commission could not care less whether Euronews fails."
"Worse than that, it is ignoring the budgetary authority, which it should do its best to respect."
"– Madam President, we have heard various speakers on behalf of the committees, and I would like to know why we have not heard from all of them; for example, there is no speaker listed for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"I would have thought it would be normal procedure for a speaker from each committee to be given the opportunity to put forward his committee’s opinion."
"– Mr Rübig, I take note of your comment but, as you know, all Members who have spoken were entitled to do so because they had put their names down to speak or because their groups had put their names down."
". Madam President, I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate and I thank you all for the encouraging words and sometimes also for the disapproving words."
"That is part and parcel of normal debate."
"It will be clear to you that I cannot respond to everyone."
"I would like to touch upon the main points."
"I am in any event pleased with the comments of Mrs Schreyer, who says that in comparison with previous years the budget on which we are about to vote is one that shows the smallest increase in comparison with the proposals of the Council and the Commission."
"I very much appreciate her remarks about the acceptance by the Commission of initiatives with regard to agriculture."
"This I find a good thing."
"Once again I hope that the Council too will adopt them, but to be on the safe side this Parliament has amended all the preparatory actions and all the pilot projects in both category I and category III should the Council reject the actions in category I. I can only recommend: try to finance it from category I. The margin is greater here than in category III."
"Mr Garriga and Mrs Dührkop have expressed their concern about the progress of the codecision procedure on the A 30 lines, etc. I share this concern."
"I hope that come the end of the year we do not find ourselves in a situation in which we have serious difficulties about how to continue funding these projects."
"I think that it is of the utmost importance for the reputation of the European Union in general and in the interest of everything that we fund that these programmes continue."
"Nor do I think that we should make legislation in haste."
"It seems to me that the Commission would be wise to reflect as soon as possible on the possibility of a transitional period, so that we can in any event continue with the funding of those projects that we have funded in the past."
"As regards the issues touched upon by various speakers, I would wish, as rapporteur, to adhere to the maintenance of the financial perspectives as they have been agreed."
"I can only express the hope that when we vote, certainly where category 1B is concerned, we do not exceed these financial perspectives."
"I do of course agree with Terry Wynn, who says that this is only the first reading."
"Nonetheless, I think that even in the first reading we must adhere to this principle as far as possible."
"Mr Dover, he is no longer in the Chamber, expressed doubts about the need for the many languages in the European Union."
"This is a recurring theme in many speeches."
"I think that we must simply comply with the Treaty."
"Mr Terry Wynn has, I think, given an excellent account of the problem, both as regards category 1B, about which I have already spoken, and as regards the Iraq question."
"I think that we must simply await the result of the vote and decide what we are going to have to do on the basis of it."
"Mr Ferber and many others also spoke about the importance of the info points, I have already talked about them myself."
"In this matter too I think that the Commission must come up with proposals quickly, so that we do not cause these info points any irreparable damage, because they are highly regarded by the European public."
"Even with new financial regulations we need to take measures so that we can continue with them."
"As for Mr Kuckelkorn, so far I have been pleased with the satisfactory level of cooperation with regard to the agencies."
"I hope that this remains so in the future too."
"Two points about these agencies, on which a decision will probably be made on Thursday: putting 10% in the reserve and talking about the organisational charts of the agencies."
"I hope that everything can be worked out in close cooperation with both him and the agencies, so that we can resolve this whole issue before the second reading."
"There is no intention to make unnecessary difficulties, but a Parliament does need to exercise its democratic powers properly."
"Mr Bartho Pronk, he is no longer in the Chamber, but I can confirm that the guarantee funds for small and medium-sized businesses will also apply to those small and medium-sized businesses that are concerned with health and safety at work."
"There is nothing to prevent this."
"Finally, Mr Goodwill, who was wondering about us giving the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen extra duties without making new resources available to it."
"There has been close consultation with the agency and it feels that it would be able to perform these extra duties within the draft budget handed over by us."
"So if they themselves say that, then who am I to give them extra money?"
"That is why I have come to this viewpoint."
"I am hoping for continuing good cooperation with each and every one of you and once again can I express my thanks to everyone who has contributed to this debate."
". Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by again thanking Mr Mulder for his kind words."
"I think it likely that we will be able to continue to enjoy excellent cooperation at the next stage of the Budget procedure."
"I would like to respond briefly to Mr Perry’s comments on the way our accounts are kept."
"Our accounting is consistent."
"Year in, year out, the Court of Auditors confirms to us that the accounts accurately reflect the receipts, outgoings, assets and liabilities as at the end of the year."
"We are modernising it, but this accounting is consistent."
"As several speakers have mentioned the Infopoints, let me reiterate that it is not the legal basis that is at issue here."
"Rather than being an issue identical with that of the A-30 lines, for which a legal basis appears to be needed, these are information channels, in respect of which the Commission has a prerogative."
"There are various aspects to this, and I know that the committee is discussing them."
"I have to point out to you that there are thousands of Infopoints that function without loans from the Commission’s budget, and we must indeed not forget them."
"The other question will be dealt with by a group of Commissioners in preparation for the next meeting of the Inter-Institutional Group on Information."
"If I may turn to the A-30 lines and the basic acts, I would like in particular to return to what was said by various speakers, notably by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, who has the hardest of tasks here in attempting to show the committees how urgently necessary this legal basis is."
"The Council’s failure to put sufficient emphasis on this issue is something that I find unacceptable."
"We simply have to bear in mind the timeframe involved."
"If an intermediate solution were now to be decided on, only for the Council to say, ‘marvellous, now we don’t need to do anything’, then we would very soon be facing a situation in which Parliament would be meeting for the last time before the European elections without there being a new legal basis in place."
"I also think that the attitude exemplified by some elements in the Council, who say, ‘These grants are in Parliament’s interests’, to be absolutely wrong."
"It is also, quite obviously, in the interests of the Member States that the grants to such bodies as the Institutes in Florence and Bruges – to name but two – should be secured."
"To do so is, after all, in the common European interest, and that is why it is also in the common interest that these legal bases should be established as soon as possible."
"Let me conclude by returning to the very important issue of aid for Iraq."
"The splitting of the European Union into two camps over whether or not there should be military intervention put us in a difficult position."
"We are agreed, though, that we want to help the people there not only with humanitarian aid, as we have done this year, but that we who belong to the European Union also want to play a part in reconstruction."
"At the moment, however, our actions are subject to imponderables."
"Who in this House can say what the situation will be in – for example – six months’ time?"
"As things stand, the situation is that the United Nations itself removed its personnel from Iraq a number of weeks ago, so someone will have to implement on the ground whatever aid we decide on."
"What matters, after all, is that what we do is realistic."
"Our commitment to Afghanistan, Mr Elles, was for five years."
"What we are trying to do right now is to make a commitment up to the end of this year, and I urge you not to lose sight of that fact."
"If the EUR 500 million amendment were to be adopted, what commitment should the Commission make in Madrid in view of the Council’s talking at the same time in terms of EUR 200 million?"
"If you do not want to make cuts in category 4, the money would soon end up having to come out of an expanded flexibility reserve, and that requires a joint decision."
"That would mean that the Commission would be unable to make any firm commitment in Madrid, and so I ask you to reconsider this."
"Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, asked me a specific question about the possibility of a supplementary budget."
"I can tell him that it is likely that there will – as a direct consequence of the Member States’ hesitancy – be another donors’ conference, possibly next year."
"I would therefore ask you to consider whether it might not be possible for Parliament, at the present first reading stage, to make, by means of a motion, a declaration on the 2004 Budget in which it calls upon the Commission to present a report on the implementation and evaluation of this aid halfway through next year."
"If a different security situation and the resolution of other political issues then makes it possible for aid to be provided on the ground, it will be possible to consider adopting a different resolution on the amount of money involved."
"For the moment, I really do ask you to give the Commission a clear mandate for the donors’ conference and to make it abundantly clear that, where aid is concerned, the European Union and its Parliament now speak with one voice."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
". Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, support for Iraq? 160 million, 200, even 500 million are being mentioned as if they were nothing."
"Whatever it ends up being, I want to make it very clear here that the funds for development aid must not be drawn on for this!"
"Combating poverty is the main aim of European development cooperation, this is what the money must be used for."
"In my opinion the reserve and the flexibility instrument are the proper sources for the European contribution to Iraq."
"As rapporteur I have made out the case for the modification of the nomenclature of the budget lines for development cooperation with Asia and Latin America."
"The majority of the people living below the poverty line of 1 dollar still live in these two regions."
"These budget lines must come under development cooperation and not under external relations."
"It is a matter of activity-based budgeting here and not of the internal structure of the Commission as a basis for the breakdown of the budget."
"Another point is the know-how in the EU delegations."
"If the level can be boosted here through training and extra investments, not only will we achieve the target figure of 35% for the social infrastructure in developing countries, but we can also ensure that at least 20% of this can be spent on primary education and health care."
"In its answer of 2 October 2003 (P-2694/03) the Commission confirms reports of discrimination in Germany against firms from other Member States."
"In the meantime, the Federal German Government has postponed the introduction of the motorway toll indefinitely."
"In the light of this new development, can the Commission state whether the working party in its current form (comprising representatives of the Commission, the Federal German Government, the road haulage sector and Toll Collect) will continue its work, so that, should a new date be set for the introduction of the toll, a comprehensive report on the difficulties affecting the operation of the system and opinions on a possible breach of the Treaty can be made available."
"Should the working party not be allowed to fulfil its remit, will the Commission, on the basis of the facts as they stand, then open infringement proceedings against Germany with a view to requiring the Federal German Government or the operating firm to demonstrate that all remaining discriminatory aspects of the system have been eliminated?"
". Mr President, I would like to point out that Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of tolls, based on the distance travelled by goods vehicles, proposing a fixed average price of 12.6 cents per kilometre."
"On 6 March, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of reimbursement of tolls – reimbursement, partial at least, or payment – based on special charges, which could allow payment of up to a sum of 15 cents on average."
"The Commission must assess whether the notified measure is compatible with the common market and conforms to the applicable Community legislation."
"Given the doubts raised by this measure, on 23 July 2003, the Commission decided to begin a formal investigation, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, so that Germany and other interested parties could make their observations."
"On 27 August 2003 the text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and the Commission is scheduled to make the final decision by the end of the year."
"The Commission believes that the system of tolls could be discriminatory if certain technical problems are not resolved before it is introduced."
"The Commission and the German Government, therefore, created a working group intended to examine the technical problems raised by the introduction of the system of tolls, and this group is demonstrating that it works well."
"I would also like to point out that the Commission has asked the German Government to ensure that the installation of tolls hinders the free movement of traffic in Europe as little as possible and that, if problems arise once it is in operation, the Commission would take the appropriate measures."
"In any event, however, I would like to say that we in the Commission have acted in defence of the Treaties, and that, since the end of August and the beginning of September, we have established channels of cooperation with the German Government which are operating in a more than satisfactory way."
"Commissioner, I also emphasised in the various questions that the Commission acted appropriately on this matter."
"My concerns merely lie in the fact that the toll has been postponed indefinitely and that this working group, which you have already put in place, has also helped us to show that shortcomings have arisen and that this has also led to discrimination between various Member States."
"My question is, therefore, whether the working group will be able to continue its work in this transitional phase."
"If it will not, will the Commission open infringement proceedings?"
"I think that it is clear that the toll system in principle is not being called into question, rather that, amongst other things, the control apparatus, which will be used to collect this toll for Germany, is a system that, firstly, has shown technical shortcomings and, secondly, will not be available to all businesses."
"That is enough, as far as I am concerned, to continue this investigation, that is to say, the monitoring."
". I would like to say that there has not yet been any discrimination, amongst other things because the toll is not operational."
"What I would like to point out is this: it is the German authorities themselves who have decided that the date for the toll to become operational will be delayed, as a result of the non-compliance of the industries in the consortium with which the construction of the equipment and the implementing of the system had been agreed, and in view of the faults detected."
"The German Transport Minister, Mr Stolpe, has repeatedly assured me – and the facts bear him out – that this system will not become operational until it is operating normally, with no problems and with no discrimination."
"That, then, is what I am taking into account."
". – Mr President, Commissioner e Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, we know that transport is a delicate issue."
"I would, therefore, be interested to know what the situation actually is regarding the inquiry into the legal bases, that is to say the current legal bases according to the and the provision for the intended legal bases, for example, the infrastructure costs directive as well as vignettes, toll, road pricing, ecopoints – in fact, the whole caboodle."
"In my view, it is very important for the strategy, and for its implementation in the Member States, that we keep the argument right to the point and that we try to bring the current and future measures into line."
". Mr Rübig, there is currently a set of rules, known as Eurovignette, which establishes the criteria according to which payment can be established for the use of certain infrastructures, that is to say tolls."
"The problem is that we believe that this Directive is not sufficiently clear or complete and, for example, does not provide for the possibility of cross-funding of alternative infrastructures, an issue which appears to be essential if we are to establish adequate infrastructures within the European Union."
"We have therefore made a proposal on a legal basis, the legal basis for transport, which is approved by a majority and does not require unanimity."
"It is true that the current Eurovignette Directive has a different legal basis, the fiscal legal basis; it is therefore considered a tax, while in the proposal we are now making, what we are proposing is a payment for the costs incurred as a result of the use of an infrastructure."
"Furthermore, we can maintain that legal basis, which is the one for transport, because we are talking about a payment for the use of an infrastructure, provided that the money received in this way does not enter the State’s accounts, because if it enters the public accounts, the administrative budgets, whether of the State, of the Autonomous Community or of a region, we would automatically be returning to the fiscal legal basis and it would therefore require unanimity."
"Therefore, Mr Rübig, I believe it is essential that we preserve what is laid out in this proposal: to link that income to the use of the infrastructure, to the maintenance of infrastructures and the transport sector, and not to link this income to public income, the income of administrations, because in that case, I would repeat, we would have to opt for a different legal basis and we would have to approve it unanimously, and I do not know if that would be the best approach if we really want to achieve a modification in the Eurovignette Directive."
"Following my questions to the Commission concerning travel through Bulgaria and the information I sent regarding events in September 2001, I myself travelled along the main transit routes in Bulgaria and Serbia and Montenegro from 6 to 8 September, where I was able to confirm that the complaints passed on to me were well-founded."
"I learnt from transit travellers that foreigners are often asked to pay EUR 5 to customs officials."
"When travellers do not comply with this demand, officials threaten to keep their vehicles waiting at the border for a long time."
"I was able to see for myself how police and customs officials imposed arbitrary and unjustified fines and charges of between EUR 70 and 200 per vehicle after carrying out unnecessary checks."
"This behaviour is in stark contravention of the rules and procedures which the EU expects applicant countries to observe."
"Can the Commission clarify this situation and say what action it has taken to address the problem?"
". Mr President, Mr Ceyhun, the Commission is aware of the events that you describe in your question."
"These are events that, I am sorry to say, we are not just aware of in Bulgaria but also in many other countries in this world, and I think that you know as well as I do why these events occur."
"Nevertheless, we must remember that the behaviour of police and customs officials, as described in your question, is illegal; it also constitutes a criminal offence according to Bulgarian law and must be punished."
"The Commission has had regular and in-depth discussions with the Bulgarian Government about these issues and has pressed for measures aimed at resolving them."
"I must, however, mention that the Commission is not in any way able to open investigations in individual cases and in any case this is the responsibility of the national authorities."
"In my view, the problem of corruption at a border crossing or in transit is a question that, as well as being considered in terms of the rule of law, must also be considered in terms of fighting corruption."
"In its cooperation with Bulgaria, the Commission gave particular priority to both of these questions."
"What I would like to say is that I believe that the whole criminal justice system in Bulgaria needs to be radically reformed and this belief is shared by the Bulgarian Government."
"It was difficult to achieve this and it has not yet been fully achieved because to do so required a change in the constitution, which has been blocked for many years."
"During a visit to Bulgaria this summer I intervened in a very unconventional way to try to overcome this blockade."
"My attempt was successful, and the constitutional change has now been adopted so that all obstacles to the necessary judicial reform have been removed, and the Commission is holding further talks with the Bulgarian authorities on widespread support for it."
"Furthermore, in cooperation with the Commission, the Bulgarian Government has drawn up an action plan to fight corruption, which will now be gradually implemented."
"This involves radical reform of toll and police management and tighter control measures."
"The Bulgarian Government has pledged to ensure that all citizens have access to an efficient complaints procedure."
"The measures that were implemented last year have, in the meantime, led to 218 disciplinary procedures against customs officials and 212 actions against police officials."
"To date forty customs officials and forty-seven police officers have been sacked."
"The Commission will continue to follow future development in this area and make full use of the instruments that we have available in order to make sure Bulgaria adheres to international standards and to help Bulgaria to do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner erheugen, I would like to mention that the Bulgarian authorities have in the meantime apologised to me, as I myself experienced this with my German passport."
"I would now like to put aside this question because I believe that you will continue to work in this area and that this problem will be resolved, if at all possible, before 2007."
"The development of electronic commerce has boosted the advertising and sale of pharmaceutical products on the Internet without a doctor's prescription, often endangering the lives of people who obtain the products (as in the case of a 24-year-old man in Britain)."
"Even though it is well known that the approval, advertising and sale of pharmaceutical items is controlled by strict regulations in the European Union, the international nature of the Internet makes it possible to circumvent those regulations."
"Does the Commission have any information concerning the extent of the legal electronic sale of pharmaceutical products in the European Union?"
"Does it have any information on the total supply of pharmaceutical products through the Internet with and without an electronic prescription, within and outside the EU?"
"Will it study the phenomenon in cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, the World Health Organisation and the FDA so that measures can be put forward aimed at averting the danger to health and preventing fraud against the public?"
"Will it conduct a European campaign to raise awareness and inform consumers of the risks posed by the sale of pharmaceutical products on the Internet?"
". – Community legislation on medicines strictly regulates their authorisation, their placing on the market, and their classification."
"The same applies to their advertising."
"Nevertheless, the supply of medicines to private individuals, in other words the sale to the public by a pharmacist, is not regulated at Community level under pharmaceutical legislation."
"As a result, the sale of medicines to private individuals through the Internet is not covered by European pharmaceutical legislation."
"Sales of this nature fall under national provisions, which must be seen in the context of the ‘general principles’ of the Treaty, in other words, Articles 28 to 30 on the free movement of goods."
"The Commission does not, therefore, have accurate figures on the scale of legal electronic sales of medicines in the European Union."
"Nor does it have figures for the total quantity of medicines supplied through the Internet within the European Union and beyond its borders, with or without an electronic prescription."
"This issue could also be considered in light of the Directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts, which lays down that, in order to guarantee a higher level of consumer protection, Member States can adopt or uphold stricter provisions, providing that these are compatible with the Treaty."
"These provisions include, should this prove necessary, banning the marketing on their territory, by means of a remote contract, of certain goods or services, in particular medicines, in compliance with the Treaty."
"The issue of the compatibility of national measures with the Treaty, in other words Articles 28 to 30, is currently the subject of the DocMorris NV and Jacques Waterval case, which is pending in the Court of Justice."
"The issue mainly concerns looking at the proportionality of national measures of this nature and the justification for them, in order to protect human health and life."
"The sale of medicines through the Internet raises issues of health protection and legal issues and improving the information available to patients is precisely one of the key elements of the recent Commission communication entitled ‘A Stronger European-based Pharmaceutical Industry for the Benefit of the Patient – A Call for Action’."
"The Commission has committed itself to looking into setting up a realistic and practical framework for informing patients about prescription medicines."
"By the way, the Commission intends to set up a European health portal which could address these issues."
"It should, however, be noted that it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to inform consumers about the dangers of buying over the Internet and to monitor these activities."
"The Commission can, therefore, only act in a very limited set of circumstances."
"Commissioner, I am of course sorry that we do not have more specific details to show us the extent and gravity of the problem."
"Allow me, therefore, to tell you that the turnover from the electronic trade in pharmaceutical products exceeds EUR 5 billion, while we do not know who is selling the pharmaceutical products."
"Inquiries conducted into the matter have shown that they are people engaged in criminal activities."
"Similarly, we do not know the place of origin of the pharmaceutical products, because they often do not come from places such as the USA or Canada, but from India or Brazil, with the result that the composition and content of the pharmaceutical product are very harmful and bear no relation to the indications. There is also a circuit of counterfeit, fictitious medical opinions, which result in a threat to the life of the person accepting the pharmaceutical product."
"This too has been observed in Great Britain."
"Unfortunately, in 2003 alone, more than 600 British subjects purchased pharmaceutical products over the Internet."
"Do we really have to allow this advertising, especially when it concerns young ages?"
"The pharmaceutical products which have the greatest market penetration via the Internet are for the overweight."
"So they concern very young ages."
"I think that, irrespective of national legislation, we absolutely must take steps at Community level also."
"The Commissioner has taken note of the honourable Member’s statement, which is not a question."
"We will proceed to the second part of this Question Time. Two Commissioners will reply, starting with Mr Byrne."
"On 1 July 2003, the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs said in Parliament that he had asked his services 'to consider the development of standards for meat preparations that would limit the amount of water that can be added to such products and the use of animal proteins for the purpose of bulking."
"My intention is to analyse the work that has been undertaken by my services, to determine what further work can be done.'"
"Now that a good four months have passed since that Parliamentary debate, can the Commission inform us of the current situation, including the practical measures it has already taken to protect consumers and increase their awareness of such meat fraud?"
". Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Staes for tabling a question on adding water and protein to chicken meat."
"This issue was debated during sitting of 1 July 2003, so it is now an opportunity to inform the House about the present state of play."
"I would first like to say a few words on the background to this issue."
"As you know, the Irish and UK authorities have revealed fraudulent practices designed to artificially increase the weight of poultry-meat by adding water and protein to other ingredients."
"The process is used to retain a large quantity of water, up to 40% or indeed, even as high as 50%."
"That is the reason why I have asked my services to do all they can in order to improve this unfortunate situation."
"In line with the proposal made by the UK authorities, my services have been working on a Commission directive in order to highlight, on the label, the presence of added water in such products."
"A draft has been discussed with experts from Member States and stakeholders."
"It provides a requirement to include 'with added water', and the percentage of water added, in the name of the product itself."
"However, I remain of the opinion that labelling products to which water has been added is only the second best solution if water has been added only to increase artificially the weight and therefore to mislead the consumer."
"The practice of adding water to food in order to cheat the consumer is despicable."
"I have therefore again asked my services to examine whether there is any possibility of banning this practice under current Community law, and that work is being undertaken at the moment."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer."
"I would like to ask a few supplementary questions."
"So far there has been talk of these practices from the Netherlands happening in Ireland and the United Kingdom."
"Is there now any view of whether these practices have taken place in other Member States as well?"
"In the debate on 1 July you announced that there would be more cooperation between the Member States and the Commission to tighten the controls on fraudsters."
"What steps have you now taken in this regard?"
"You have already answered a number of other questions I was about to ask."
"But on 1 July you also announced that you would be developing standards for meat products."
"As regards the presence of water, you have answered that."
"But what about the presence of other proteins, ‘chicken meat’ that contains beef or pork proteins?"
"What is the state of play on that point?"
"Can you offer any prospect of a total ban on this practice?"
"Because I think that the last part of your answer is absolutely right: really this practice is totally unacceptable and there should be a total ban on these practices."
"Do you have any idea of when such a ban might be issued and whether it could be issued?"
". Investigative work is being undertaken in conjunction with Member States."
"I am in a position to say to you that this practice appears to be continuing. Therefore there is continuing concern in Member States and at Commission level."
"A number of steps have been taken in relation to this, not only at an investigative level."
"I have also asked my services to conduct a detailed legal analysis of the current legislation in place dealing with this kind of situation."
"In particular, I have asked for an analysis of Council Directive 71/18/EEC: the belief is that piece of legislation bans the inclusion of water and hydrolysed protein for the purpose of retaining the water."
"That is currently under legal analysis."
"It is my intention, when that analysis is complete, to prepare a Commission communication for presentation to the Member States."
"It is rather early, at this stage, to give you further detail on the ongoing investigation and analysis of the legal position and the legislation already in place, but I hope to be in a position to do so in the relatively near future, and to present a communication that will be available for discussion in Parliament in due course."
"– Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, in connection with the study dealing with the evolution of rules pertaining to meat products, it is also possible to investigate the restrictions which relate to the mechanical separation of meat and bone matter."
"For example, this restriction, which forbids the mechanical separation of meat and bones, sounds quite crazy as far as poultry are concerned."
"Of course I understand that this is necessary for beef to prevent the spread of BSE."
"I have heard, however, that the Commission is planning such a ban for poultry too."
"That would mean significant costs for broiler production, for example, and it cannot be regarded as a rational move that the mechanical separation of poultry meat and bone should also be totally banned."
"Can you tell us if the intention in this communication that the Commission is to issue is also to deal with the rules on meat products on a broader basis?"
". The communication that I have spoken about is designed to deal with the situation that was raised by Mr Staes in his question, that is, focusing on the issues of the retention of water in meat products – in particular in poultry – and the inclusion of hydrolysed protein so as to retain the water in the product."
"That is the purpose of this communication."
"In relation to the other issue you raised, all I can say is that we currently consider all issues relevant to food safety."
"I cannot give you an answer at the moment as to whether the particular point you raised is one of those issues, but it is something that I can deal with."
"If you would like to write to me on the subject, I will give you a more detailed response."
"I should like the Commissioner to tell us two things."
"Firstly, is he considering specific limits for the percentage of water which can be added?"
"I understood that we were looking now at an upper limit of around 20%, instead of the 40% and 50% we sometimes see."
"Secondly, does he realise that the perpetrators of this scam said on British television that they have foolproof ways of disguising the fact that protein not of the origin advertised could be added to the product?"
"Will he ask the EFSA or a similar body to investigate how these methods have continued in the way they have?"
"They constitute consumer fraud and a public health scandal."
". I have to say to Mr Whitehead that I do not approve of the procedure whereby water is retained in a product for the purpose of bulking it out, increasing the weight, so that consumers are misled into believing they are buying more protein than they are actually buying."
"It is a clearly misleading practice designed to defraud the consumer."
"I do not, therefore, have any ambition to put in place an upper limit for the inclusion of water which, even at 20%, has the effect of misleading the consumer."
"On the question of whether this protein can be disguised or not, this is also part of the ongoing work."
"But what I am focusing on at the moment is the capacity of the Commission to bring forward a proposal founded on any legal base that may currently exist."
"In other words, is there legislation in place at the moment that can be interpreted in such a way as to lead to the banning of this particular activity?"
"That is the focus of my attention at the moment."
"These other issues, as you rightly point out, are of importance also, and we will address them in due course."
"A new trend has swept through discotheques, bookshops and night shops in Belgium over the last few months: cardboard sheaths have appeared, into which cigarette packs may be slotted, thus concealing the health warnings on such packs."
"Directive 2001/37/EC(1) stipulates that, as from 30 September 2003, health warnings must cover 30% of the front of cigarette packs and not less than 40% of the back."
"The aim of those who designed this product is quite clear: they wish to conceal the health warnings with colour sheaths and, eventually, with commercial advertisements."
"Has the Commission been informed of this practice?"
"Does it also realise that this is a booming market affecting twelve of the fifteen Member States?"
"Does it intend to take action, together with the Member States, in order to put a stop to a trade which is in blatant contravention of the spirit of Directive 2001/37/EC?"
"Or will it, at the very least, undertake to consider possible legal action?"
". The Community is pursuing a coherent and comprehensive tobacco control policy through legislation including contents, packaging and labelling of tobacco products."
"Although it has been able to develop robust tobacco legislation, it faces challenges every day, ranging from litigation to the incorrect implementation of provisions of this legislation."
"The honourable Member asks whether cardboard covers into which cigarette packets are put in order to hide the health warning, are against the 'spirit of the directive'."
"This issue is bound to be considered in the context of implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive."
"Article 5 of this directive requires that the content of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields should be printed on the cigarette packet and each unit packet of cigarettes must carry general and additional health warnings covering at least 30% of the front and 40% of the back surface, aimed at informing the consumer about the risks of tobacco use."
"One of the main purposes of the Tobacco Products Directive is to alert consumers to the health effects of tobacco use through clear and visible health warnings."
"In this respect, the directive provides that these texts must in no way be hidden, obscured or interrupted by other written or pictorial matter or by the opening of the packet."
"If the cigarette packet and the cardboard cover are sold separately, it could be argued that this is not in direct contradiction with the provisions of the directive which concerns the sale of tobacco and not the sale of cardboard."
"If the cardboard cover is purchased voluntarily by the consumer, this then is an individual decision made by the consumer who has no doubt noticed the texts and the health warnings and, presumably, does not like to see them."
"So, in this context the purpose of the directive of informing the consumer about the health effects of tobacco use has been met."
"However, where the cardboard is promoted directly or indirectly by the cigarette manufactures themselves and, for example, is given free of charge in tobacco shops, even where it is proposed or sold separately, this might affect the sale of tobacco which falls within the scope of the directive and jeopardise its useful effect."
"It could then be seen, as the honourable Member suggests, as going against the spirit of the directive."
"The Commission is aware, for instance, that in some cases these cardboard covers are on sale at government-licensed tobacco shops, and brochures advertising them are sent to the tobacco shops by the same distribution companies that bring the tobacco."
"It is up to the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure the correct implementation of the directive."
"The Commission urges the national authorities in charge of its implementation to be vigilant in that respect."
"The Community has a powerful legal instrument which needs to be implemented correctly."
"The Commission will analyse all practical issues emerging from the implementation of the directive and will report to Parliament before the end of 2004."
"If I have understood the Commissioner correctly, there are two key aspects to this matter, of which one is the potential desire to provide this free packaging when tobacco is sold."
"I believe – I am not speaking in my personal capacity but on behalf of several Members, who have waged this fight side by side with the Commissioner throughout the work carried out on this proactive and important directive – that we are talking here about vital issues, and this is something that needs to be said!"
"Our position is therefore to say that we find it extremely hard to accept this sort of legal fatalism."
"Not all being legal specialists but not, equally, being naive, we are fully aware that a legal solution – and we hope that one exists – will be extremely difficult to find."
"It is nevertheless also very hard to accept that these small objects, which some people see merely as items of fun but which are completely unacceptable, and which affect and even defeat the object of our directive, are sold in quantity today: 50 000 per day and that is only one brand, Commissioner!"
"This is a fashionable item more or less everywhere in the Member States."
"In my question I refer to twelve States, but the problem certainly occurs in all the Member States and the candidate countries."
"I therefore believe that some serious legal work needs to be done."
"We must find a solution, all the more because the Commission proposes, and we support it in this battle, to go further by including photographs."
"These will make the fashion more appealing and will further speed up the process of selling the products and the desire to cover up the reality."
"What can we do if that happens?"
"As to the second aspect, are the manufacturers themselves including this packaging?"
"In most cases, they are not, but in some, it is the manufacturers of lighters that offer these products, which is not far off."
". I fully agree with the implication of the question you ask and the last part of your question is directed to whether the tobacco industry itself is involved in this, or indeed the retail outlets themselves."
"As I indicated earlier, there seems to be some evidence that government-sponsored tobacco shops may be engaged in this exercise."
"The extent to which these products may be sold or given free of charge in conjunction with the sale of tobacco is an issue that must be addressed and resolved, particularly in the context of the implementation of the legislation which comes within the powers of the Member States themselves."
"However, if there were two completely separate and distinct transactions, one the purchase of cigarettes and the other, in a different shop in another area, the purchase of a package such as this, where an individual is free to do as he wishes with his packet of cigarettes, it seems to me that in such cases, we are reaching the point where regulation becomes more difficult."
"But, as I said earlier, the fact remains that the purchaser of the cigarette package will have been aware, and it will have been brought to his notice, that this information is contained on the packet of cigarettes."
"The photographs you refer to may also be included, if the Member State in question chooses to print them on the packet of cigarettes, though it is not compulsory to do so, and to that extent information is imparted to the consumer in the way intended by this legislation."
"So to that extent the legislation is not circumvented."
"But there are issues involved here."
"One is to ensure the proper implementation of the legislation and the other is to ensure that we do not intrude upon the freedom of the individual to do whatever he wishes with his own property, even in circumstances where we would not approve of it."
"The Commission will be aware that in 2001, the European Parliament voted for a maximum overall limit of eight hours or 500 km to be placed on the transport of animals to slaughter or further fattening."
"The Commission's Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concluded that ‘welfare tends to become poorer as journey length increases … hence journeys should be as short as possible’."
"In light of the above, will the Commission, despite not having included a maximum overall journey limit in its proposed Regulation, now support such a limit if Parliament again calls for a maximum overall limit when adopting its Opinion on the proposed Regulation?"
". On 16 July the Commission adopted its proposal on the protection of animals during transport."
"This amounts to a radical overhaul of the European rules on animal transport."
"The Commission is aware that Parliament and some Member States had called for a limitation on journeys of eight hours or 500 kilometres."
"However it should be crystal clear from the relevant scientific advice that the Scientific Committee did not recommend specific time limitations for the transport of animals as a tool to improve their welfare."
"The Commission’s proposal takes full account of the opinion of the Scientific Committee and a full range of consultations that took place with stakeholders."
"The Commission decided that the best means to give effect to the outcome of this process was to propose travel times that would coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers."
"Consequently, one of my principal aims – the effective enforcement of enhanced animal protection rules – could be achieved in a much more straightforward way."
"Tachograph evidence would be used to verify compliance."
"I am looking forward to Parliament’s views on our proposal, as well as speedy progress in the Council."
"It would be inappropriate to enter into speculation about any particular scenario in view of the respective roles of our institutions as set out in the Treaty."
"I am actually somewhat disappointed, because there seems to be a big difference between the rules for drivers of trucks transporting animals all the way to the Middle East, and the conditions that the animals themselves are kept in."
"The Commission's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare concluded that levels of animal welfare drop as journey times increase."
"As you mentioned, Commissioner, Parliament's position was eight hours."
"With a journey time of nine hours, a rest period of twelve hours, another nine hours of travelling and another twelve hours as a rest period you could just keep on going: you would have a situation where animals could be transported right around the globe and back again."
"This may continue until the animals are dead."
"This is completely unnecessary."
"It is quite clear that we are supposed to be striving to create an incentive where the animals will be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin."
"We must get rid of these excessively long journeys, particularly where animals are being transported to places as far away as the Middle East."
"I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time, rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest."
"That is not sufficient to ensure the animals' welfare and the scientists have actually pointed this out."
"I would hope that the Commission will take this on board."
"In the long term, we must consider the welfare of the animals and create incentives to reduce the need for long-distance transport."
"You will not do that, Commissioner, by creating a situation in which it can continue."
". I note the honourable Member's comments and note also the fact that she is the shadow rapporteur for the animal transport legislation."
"I am also aware of the fact that Parliament has yet to appoint the lead rapporteur – no doubt this will be done very soon."
"A report will then be made available in the usual way."
"The issue will be presented to the House for discussion, and whatever amendments are tabled will be addressed by the Commission in the usual way."
"We shall then be in a position to have a full debate on the issues raised."
"In the meantime I have taken note of what the honourable Member has said."
"In considering this legislation, would you bear in mind that a certain flexibility is certainly desirable?"
"For example, if you have a rigid nine hours or eight hours with rest periods thereafter, you may be within sight of the ultimate destination."
"In such cases, it is certainly better to allow an hour or two extra driving rather than a 12-hour rest period followed by a further one or two hours' driving."
"I appeal to you to consider a certain flexibility in the application of any legislation related to animal transport."
"."
"I note the point made by Mr Purvis, it is a view he has expressed to me before."
"This is one of a number of issues being considered by the Presidency in its response to this legislation."
"Of course, under the usual procedure that applies to the enactment of legislation, these and other issues will presumably form part of the consideration of the proposal by Parliament and by the Council in the form of amendments designed to find the appropriate way forward."
"It is not for me at this stage to present any further proposals, but rather to respond to any amendments that might be tabled by the House or indeed by the Council of Ministers."
"Finally, I have noted the point that you have made and no doubt we will discuss it at a later time."
"I also have concerns about the proposal on animal transport."
"The UK currently has a derogation from EU law whereby the export of horses and ponies from the UK to the continent for slaughter is prohibited."
"As you know, the UK has a number of semi-wild herds of ponies in the New Forest and Dartmoor."
"As I understand it, the proposal on animal transport that you have recently published will force the UK to lift that derogation and allow the export of hundreds, if not thousands, of horses and ponies for slaughter to France, Belgium and Italy."
"I think that is an absolutely shocking proposition, given that Britain is a nation of horse-lovers and given the particular cultural values which British people attach to horses and ponies."
"Will the Commission be able to support the amendment that I plan to table in the Environment Committee which would allow the UK to prohibit the export of horses and ponies from the UK for slaughter or further fattening?"
". I am aware of the issues that you raise."
"There are, however, some factual errors in the point that you make."
"There is no derogation in place at the moment."
"The derogation that was in place was removed in 1995."
"It would therefore be incorrect to suggest that the current draft legislation under consideration does anything to change the situation from the ."
"Having said that, this morning I discussed this very issue with your colleague, Mr Parish."
"I am aware that there is concern in the UK about the issue."
"I have expressed my views on that and I am sensitive to the points that have been made."
"Those views will, I understand, achieve some publicity in the press in the UK tomorrow."
"I have asked my services to look at this particular point to try and achieve an outcome that you might like, while at the same time ensuring that the rules of the operation of the internal market are not damaged."
"So, the issue is under consideration."
"In June 2001, on an initiative by Sweden, the Member States' Health Ministers decided to call on the Commission to draw up a Community strategy to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol."
"At the present time, we are witnessing increasing regular consumption of alcohol and an increasing amount of 'binge-drinking' among young people in certain Member States."
"The links between starting young and heavy alcohol consumption, drug abuse and crime are an established fact."
"Alcohol-related problems are also severe in several of the accession countries."
"What progress has the Commission made in drafting a global Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related damage and in setting a timetable for the various measures?"
". I fully share the concerns of the honourable Member on this important question."
"Alcohol is one of the most important health determinants in the Community."
"I should like to assure you that the Commission, in further developing the Community public health strategy, will also focus on reducing alcohol-related harm."
"The Community adopted two important documents on alcohol policy during the Swedish presidency in June 2001."
"The Council conclusions of 5 June 2001 on a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, referred to by the honourable Member, and the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents (2001/458/EC)."
"One major step in preparing these documents was the Stockholm Conference on Alcohol and Young People in February 2001."
"It has to be emphasised that, besides being an important health policy issue, alcohol is also a controversial and politically sensitive issue both at the Community level and in the Member States."
"A Community strategy must be carefully planned in co-operation with the Member States."
"It must also be evidence based."
"Hence we have to assess the different measures as well as the different situations in the Member States."
"The adoption of the new public health programme has provided the Commission with an efficient instrument in preparing the strategy."
"First, a report on alcohol is going to be completed by the end of 2004 under the health information part of the new programme."
"This report will deal with the economic and social costs of alcohol, including issues of promotion of alcohol, protection of children and young people."
"Second, hopefully from the beginning of next year, we will create a network of expert organisations to support the implementation of the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, and to develop further a Community strategy on alcohol foreseen in the Council conclusion referred to by the honourable Member."
"The Commission has recently created a working party on alcohol and health, where the Member States' representatives discuss different aspects of alcohol policy in the Community and, specifically, how the Member States are implementing the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people."
"The working party will also allow us to monitor the situation in the new Member States."
"A Commission report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people is due to be presented at the end of 2005."
"This report will consider the extent to which the proposed measures are working effectively and the need for revision or further action."
"The Commission is also exploring with the WHO euro-region and the Member States the possibility of holding a conference on alcohol and health in 2005 as a follow up to the Stockholm Conference in 2001."
"The results of this conference, together with the report on the application of the Council recommendation on young people and alcohol, will allow us to define the strategy, which will reflect the situation of the larger European Union."
"In making progress at Community level, we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling these phenomena."
"An integrated approach to combating alcohol-related issues needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators."
"Effective enforcement of existing national legislation on issues ranging from drink-driving to age limits could make a significant difference."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I interpret this as indicating that this work will now be entering a more intensive phase and that it will result in a good many practical measures."
"So far, we have unfortunately seen the Commission more readily adopting measures to increase, rather than reduce, consumption."
"The latest example was seen as recently as last Monday."
"In a so-called justified opinion, the Commission demanded that Sweden repeal its ban on the private import of alcoholic drinks via independent intermediaries, that is to say without the purchaser having to go via the state retailing monopoly."
"Through this measure, the ability to monitor the age of purchasers would all but disappear, and it would become considerably more difficult to deduct the correct alcohol tax."
"In the light of this, I should like to put a further question to the Commissioner: if we are to formulate a strategy on this important public health problem, would it not be appropriate for different parts of the Commission to work towards the same objective?"
". The Commission does not have any ambition to increase the consumption of alcohol in the European Union or indeed in the Member States, and nor do its policies seek to achieve that."
"As I have indicated to you, the measures that are being undertaken by my Directorate-General and by others in the Commission, seek to achieve a situation whereby there will be a reduction of binge drinking in particular, especially among young people."
"This phenomenon exists in a number of Member States, not all Member States."
"It is, however, an issue for the Member States themselves."
"It is a national competence issue and it would be wrong to look to the policies of the European Union either to encourage or discourage alcohol consumption."
"We can only act in the light of the competences that are available to us at European Union level: this issue is the primary responsibility of each individual Member State, and some Member States have a bigger problem than others."
"Those Member States that have a bigger problem should ensure that they put in place policies at national level to try to resolve this situation."
"Although we have exceeded the 30 minutes of questions, we will put a final one, if the Commissioner will allow us."
"The Commission’s Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare published a report in 1998 that concluded 'force-feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds'."
"Would the Commission agree that to allow such a cruel practice to continue in the European Union is a disgrace particularly at a time when we are trying to convince the rest of the world that we have good welfare standards in our livestock production systems, and when can we expect a Commission proposal to phase out force-feeding?"
". I thank the honourable Member for raising this important subject and affording me the opportunity to outline the Commission’s thinking on the matter."
"The honourable Member currently refers in her question to the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concerning welfare aspects of the production of foie gras in ducks and geese."
"This report was adopted in December 1998 and covers a wide range of issues including : the origins and distribution of foie gras production; the practice of rearing and force-feeding: the behaviour of ducks and geese; the consequences of force-feeding, in particular welfare indicators; socio-economic aspects of improving the welfare of animals used in the foie gras industry; and research."
"The scientists did not look at the issue of force-feeding in isolation, but as part of the full range of factors involved in producing foie gras."
"Nevertheless, in recognising that force-feeding of birds, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds, the Scientific Committee went on to make a number of recommendations."
"The main aim of the recommendations is to improve production practices so that avoidable suffering can be mitigated."
"Thus, according to the scientists, the objectives would be, in order of priority: to reduce mortality and morbidity rates; to decrease the amounts of pain and distress that all endure in the process; and to allow the animals to engage in normal behavioural activities."
"The report makes clear that it is very important for the further development of foie gras production to introduce alternative techniques that do not require force-feeding in an intensive way."
"My services have drawn the attention of the industry to this report."
"As a consequence, the industry is studying and researching better production techniques that are more welfare-friendly."
"In addition, I would like to draw to the honourable Member’s attention the two recommendations in the framework of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes."
"They concern specifically the protection of ducks and geese kept for the production of foie gras."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission actively participated in the adoption of the recommendations."
"These recommendations provide for welfare considerations for the breeding of ducks and geese and, in particular, for the phasing out of small individual cages for ducks."
"The recommendations reflect the necessity to reduce the most intensive form of farming, as recommended in the report of the Scientific Committee to which I have already referred."
"The Community, all Member States, and most of the acceding countries are party to this Convention and, as such, are expected to give effect to the recommendations."
"In particular, parties to the Convention will have to report the status of the implementation of these particular recommendations to the Council of Europe after 1 January 2005."
"The Commission will closely follow the implementation of these recommendations, which provide for significant welfare improvements."
"Commissioner, thank you for that response."
"As I am sure you know, this is an issue of great concern to a lot of people across the European Union, and they will want to know that we are tackling it with a great degree of urgency."
"I would like to bring to your attention Council Directive 98/58/EC – the general farm animal welfare directive – which states that 'no animal shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner (...) which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury'."
"Given that the mechanical force-feeding of ducks and geese does exactly that, will the Commission please state whether it is satisfied with the application of Directive 98/58/EC in France and Belgium in particular?"
"Directive 98/58/EC also allows for Community measures to ensure the uniform application of Council of Europe recommendations."
"Given that Germany and Denmark, together with Poland, have already prohibited force-feeding, will the Commission now come forward and propose an outright ban on so as to harmonise EU legislation in this area?"
". All the scientific advice I receive in relation to this issue focuses on the manner in which the force-feeding takes place, that is, the circumstances surrounding the force-feeding."
"Whether the birds are kept in cages, for instance, and the other circumstances and conditions in which the birds are kept."
"It is important to emphasise that there is no scientific advice available to us to the effect that the force-feeding itself, as distinct from the conditions under which the animals are kept, is contrary to animal welfare."
"That is the clear advice I have in relation to this issue, and I give that response to you for your consideration."
"In those circumstances, I am satisfied that Directive 98/58 is being properly implemented."
"I believe the Commissioner is wrong about force-feeding itself not causing unnecessary suffering or injury and not being in breach of the directive on farm animals, as Mrs Lucas mentioned."
"If you stick a funnel down a goose's throat and force-feed it with maize, there is no way that you are not causing suffering or injury."
"It is ludicrous to suggest that it is not causing injury."
"Secondly, the Israeli supreme court has actually ruled that force-feeding is illegal – and that in a country where they had quite a large production of through force-feeding."
"Other countries too have ruled that it is illegal."
"The European Union should do the same."
"You are denying the reality of the situation if you say that force-feeding does not cause unnecessary suffering or injury."
"Looking at the directive, as Mrs Lucas has said, the only thing we can do is impose a ban on this type of feeding of animals."
". The clear advice that I have in relation to this issue is that the traditional methods of feeding ducks and geese for the production of foie gras are not contrary to animal welfare considerations."
"The real issue for concern, and the focus of attention of all the scientific evaluation on this issue, has been related to the intensive farming, intensive production and the intensive force-feeding of the birds in that way."
"The ban you mention is not on a welfare basis but rather on an ethical basis, which is a different issue."
"What we are considering here is the question of animal welfare and the treatment of animals and birds in these circumstances."
"I take note of what you have said."
"This is an issue that will be discussed at a future time."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon, Mr Byrne."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 42, 43 and 44 will be replied to in writing."
"We will move on to questions to Mr Bolkestein."
"In their report to the Commission, Commissioners Bolkestein and Patten state that the US has failed to provide them with sufficient guarantees regarding the protection of the personal data requested by the US authorities on passengers travelling to the US with European airlines."
"The interim decision of 5 March 2003 nevertheless remains in force, under which European airlines are permitted to transfer personal data on their passengers to the US authorities."
"When will the Commission lift the interim decision of 5 March 2003, given that it is clearly in breach of Community legislation on the protection of citizens' personal data?"
". The Commission would like to start by clearing up a misunderstanding that seems to underlie this question."
"At present there is no decision and no agreement."
"There is therefore nothing to abrogate."
"There is an American law which requires airlines flying to or from the United States to provide access to their passenger name records."
"Most airlines are complying with this."
"That is understandable in view of the fact that there may be negative consequences for these airlines and for their passengers if they do not supply the data to the United States."
"February's joint statement brought with it a US commitment to work with the Commission towards achieving a so-called adequacy finding regarding the level of data protection provided by the United States."
"The honourable Member is right, the Commission does not consider that the American arrangements amount to adequate protection."
"That in itself is not yet a reason to stop the process."
"Instead, the Commission is energetically pursuing the process with the aim of persuading the United States to improve its arrangements so that an adequacy finding can be made and a proper legal framework for passenger name record transfers can be provided."
"The Commission, as I told Parliament's relevant committee on 9 September 2003, is working to a deadline of Christmas 2003."
"I fear that the Commissioner's ‘understandable’ is worse than an agreement."
"In other words, what we have here are tolerance and the concealed assent of the Commission, and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular, to an infringement of the legislation of the European Union, especially the directives on data protection."
"Consequently, Commissioner, my question is: have you taken account of the resolution passed by the European Parliament's plenary a few weeks ago on combating this situation?"
". In reply to the supplementary question, perhaps I may once again explain that the Commission is in active negotiations with the Government of the United States."
"I was in Washington early last week, and during my stay I had discussions with Mr Tom Ridge who is the Secretary for the Homeland Security Department, in other words the man in charge of seeing to it that the United States is a secure and safe country."
"The legislation of the United States requires all passengers going to the United States to have their personal data sent on before their arrival."
"Quite apart from what the Commission thinks, airlines and, where necessary, computerised reservation systems, supply that data."
"That is not strictly in compliance with European law and, therefore, the situation is not good."
"European law is laid down in the Data Protection Directive which, incidentally, has not yet been transposed into the national legislations of a number of Member States."
"Anyway, it is a directive and should be policed by Member States, not by the Commission."
"Once again, this is not a good situation."
"We need to decide whether there is adequate protection of the data in the United States, that is the so-called 'adequacy finding'."
"As I told the relevant parliamentary committee in the first half of September, I cannot as yet conclude that there is adequacy on the other side of the ocean."
"Therefore the legally precarious situation continues to exist."
"Once again that is not good."
"The honourable Member said that there was a secret arrangement."
"There is nothing secret about anything at all."
"The situation is of doubtful legality, but the Commission is in discussions with the American Government to try and rectify."
"On my last visit to Washington I managed to achieve some limited progress towards an agreed solution, but we are still very far apart."
"I said to Parliament that I set a deadline of Christmas to resolve this situation."
"What will happen I do not know."
"Hopefully, we shall reach an adequacy finding later on during the near because our negotiations continue."
"If that is not the case, I shall tell Parliament that there is no adequacy and, therefore, propose that we engage in a bilateral negotiation with the United States."
"That would, of necessity, amount to a derogation from the data protection directive."
"There is also another legal instrument in the form of the computerised reservation system regulation."
"That is a regulation and, therefore, the policing of that regulation is in the hands of the Commission."
"My colleague Mrs De Palacio is more specifically responsible for that."
"Articles 6 and 11 of the regulation say that the Commission may be required to stop data flow if that data flow is not compatible with the regulation."
"But may I draw the attention of honourable Members to the fact that stopping the data flow, as I said earlier, may have dire consequences for the airlines involved."
"It may mean that all passengers have to queue up for three or four hours in Washington, New York or wherever in order to give the data required by the Americans, or that airlines are fined so many dollars per passenger or their landing rights actually suspended."
"These are no mean consequences, and I would remind the honourable Member of the possible consequences that stopping of the data flow would have."
"Having said that I understand Parliament's concerns."
"They are my concerns because I am interested in upholding the law."
"We are working to that end."
"I was in Washington last week."
"We shall continue and I shall report to Parliament as soon as I have something more substantial than at this moment on how far our American partners are prepared to go."
"According to national legal practice in some Member States it is illegal to relabel parallel-imported pharmaceuticals so that they bear the name used by the trademark holder in the importing country, if the pharmaceutical concerned can be sold in the importing country under the same name as it was marketed under in the exporting country."
"This rule applies regardless of whether the parallel importer can show that, when the product is not renamed, the importer is deprived of 25% of the market owing to rules on the substitution of pharmaceuticals and doctors' prescription habits."
"In the Commission's view, is it consistent with the provisions of the Treaty on the free movement of goods and with Court of Justice case law concerning parallel imports of pharmaceuticals for national courts to justify their ruling that the above practice is illegal on the grounds, for example, that the lack of access to the market is solely a commercial obstacle which importers must seek to overcome by means of (in principle unrestricted) marketing which targets prescribing doctors (despite the fact that parallel importers do not have access to Drug Master Files or equivalent scientific/technical data, and regardless of whether the price of the pharmaceutical is regulated by rules on the dispensing of medicines)?"
". In answer Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, I should like to point out that a parallel importation of a medicinal product is a legal form of trade within the internal market, based on Article 28 of the Treaty."
"It is also subject to the derogations regarding the protection of human health and life and also the protection of industrial and commercial property, provided by Article 30 of the Treaty."
"The European Court of Justice has ruled that the derogation to the free movement of goods, justified on the grounds of protection of industrial and commercial property, is only admissible for the purpose of safeguarding rights that constitute the specific subject matter of the property."
"The specific point of a trademark is, in particular, to guarantee to the owner that he has the exclusive right to use that trademark for the purpose of putting a product on the market for the first time."
"Accordingly, Member State legislation protecting industrial and commercial property rights may not be used to oppose the importation of a product that has already been lawfully placed on the market in another Member State by, or with the consent of, the proprietor of that right."
"In certain circumstances parallel importers are forced to relabel parallel imported medicinal products in order to have effective access to the market of the importing Member State, especially when the use of different trademarks by the proprietor contributes to the artificial partitioning of the markets between Member States."
"Partitioning of the markets would still exist if the importer were only able to sell the product in parts of his market."
"The court has ruled that repackaging and relabelling is not necessary if the parallel importer merely wishes to secure a commercial advantage."
"According to the jurisprudence of the court, relabelling is considered justified if it is objectively necessary."
"In any case, this is to be assessed on the basis of circumstances such as those mentioned in the question – circumstances prevailing at the time of the marketing of the parallel imported medicinal product in the importing Member State."
"It is for the national courts to determine in each specific case whether it is objectively necessary for the parallel importer to use the trademark used in the Member State of import to enable the imported products to have effective access to the market."
"As regards the national measures mentioned in the question, should more information on the specific circumstances become available to the Commission, these special circumstances will be assessed in the light of the jurisprudence of the court."
"My understanding of what you said is that, if I can obtain more information on this specific case, I can come to you to resolve it or refer the matter to a national court."
"These are the two solutions."
". If Mrs Riis-Jørgensen has more specific details concerning any particular case that has come to her attention, the Commission would very much like to learn of it and will follow it up in the light of the case-law of the courts with the appropriate action."
"The Commission will be grateful to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for bringing those circumstances to its notice."
"The Commission is currently examining the question of whether the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is compatible with Community law."
"The Commission knows that the Spanish Government set up the state company ‘Infraestructuras del trasvase, Sociedad Anónima (Trasagua)’ to plan and implement the Ebro water transfer(2) of the National Hydrological Plan and likewise knows that in August 2002, Trasagua awarded the tender for the Ebro water transfer environmental impact studies(3), totalling EUR 1 705 524, without having published this tender in the European Union’s Official Journal(4)."
"The Commission has already informed us that it was investigating this case, and now that a reasonable length of time has elapsed, we would ask:"
"Does the Commission believe that Trasagua enjoys the status of ‘public law body’ in terms of the Directives on public markets, set up, funded and controlled, as it is, by the Spanish Government, and therefore is subject to Directive 92/50/EEC(5) on coordinating the adjudication of public service tenders?"
"Does the Commission believe that Trasagua should have published the tenders in question in the European Union’s Official Journal?"
"Does the Commission believe that Spain failed to comply with Community law in not publishing these tenders?"
". The Commission has investigated the complaints it received in connection with the public service contracts awarded by the company Trasagua and has come to the conclusion that this entity must be regarded as a public law body within the meaning of the community directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public service contracts."
"The Commission therefore takes the view that the provisions of the public service contract directives are applicable to this entity when it awards a contract falling within the scope of these directives and that the environmental impact assessment contract referred to by the honourable Member should have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union."
"In a letter to me dated 19 June 2003 Mr Martinez Fernandez, State Secretary for Coastline and Waterways in the Spanish Environment Ministry, acknowledges that this analysis of the Commission is correct."
"And in the same letter he gives the undertaking that from now on the company Trasagua will apply the relevant provisions of the EC directives in full whenever it awards contracts."
"The Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that the Trasagua case must be placed in the broader context of the compatibility of the Spanish provisions for the implementation of the community concept of public law body."
"The Spanish Act under which the public service contract directives are implemented does after all exclude private entities from its scope, even if they conform to the definition of public law body within the meaning of the community directives."
"In this context the Commission has on various occasions taken action under Article 226 for failure to fulfil obligations."
"The Court of Justice for example recently found Spain guilty of the incorrect application of the directive on working on the construction of a prison."
"Another case relating to the more general problem of the incorrect implementation of the personnel scope of the directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public works contracts and of public supply contracts has still to come before the Court."
"In addition, on 11 July of this year the Commission decided to declare Spain in default on the same grounds in relation to Directive 92/50/EEC concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts."
"– Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his clear response."
"I am also pleased with the reply he has given, namely that the Commission has declared Spain to be in default by reason of inadequate compliance with the directive on government spending."
"This is of such importance because this is not the first problem in the case of the Spanish Hydrological Plan, the and it will not be the last."
"The fact is that this plan is enormous and requires a great deal of government funds, also government funds from the Commission, for which an application has been submitted but which, fortunately, has not yet been granted."
"I should like to urge the Commissioner to continue to act with the severity he has shown in this specific case, because it is important, in my view, for Spain to realise that it must comply with European legislation in every particular, not only as regards environmental impact assessments, but also where government tendering is concerned, particularly in this case."
"That is not a question."
"The Commissioner has taken note of your opinion."
"The Basel Committee will reach a decision on the new 'Basel II' own-capital provisions before the end of this year."
"Independently of the outcome of the Basel negotiations, I wish to ask which of the European Parliament's eight requirements the Commission will incorporate into the proposal for a directive, and how soon the proposal for a directive can be expected."
"The requirements laid down in the own-initiative report are: (1) annual adjustments to the EUR 1 million retail ceiling for inflation; (2) deletion of the 0.2% granularity criterion; (3) recognition of the specific financial situation of firms on start-up or in the event of takeover; (4) incorporation of the results of the impact study on SMEs; (5) monitoring of trends in costs and administrative expenditure incurred, in particular by smaller banks, as a result of Basel II; (6) recognition of physical collateral under the standardised approach and reduced risk weightings for mortgage bonds; (7) clear transparency of rating criteria; (8) positive assessment of research activities and investment expenditure in the fixing of ratings."
". The Commission would like to thank Mr Karas for his questions, which are important and detailed."
"The Commission services are preparing a proposal for a directive on the capital adequacy of banks and investment firms."
"As Parliament will be aware, the Basel Committee has announced a short delay in its timetable in reaching agreement on the new Basel Accord."
"The accord should now be finalised by the middle of 2004 at the latest."
"The Commission's proposal should be made very shortly thereafter."
"Implementation at the end of 2006 remains a challenging but achievable task."
"The Commission services remain firmly on track in the development of a proposal for an EU directive."
"That draft proposal is broadly consistent with the work done by the Basel Committee, but appropriately differentiated, where necessary, to take account of the specificities of the EU context as supported by the European Parliament."
"Regarding Mr Karas' fourth question, let me confirm that the results of the study on the consequences of the new framework on the European economy – especially SMEs – will be available in due time to inform the EU legislature."
"The technical details of the draft directive are still subject to reflection and consultation within the Commission, but I am pleased to provide you now with the following elements in response to the questions raised by Mr Karas."
"First, with regard to his question on retail loans, the draft directive should indeed allow a wide use of comitology procedures to make necessary changes in the light of market developments, including inflation adjustments."
"With regard to his second question, the Commission services' third consultative paper – the so-called CP3 of 1 July 2003 – no longer refers to a specific granularity criterion to distinguish retail from corporate loan portfolios."
"With respect to questions 3, 7 and 8 on banks' internal rating systems, the draft proposals do not spell out how banks should develop their rating systems and which risk factors they should take into account."
"As is currently the case, banks are only required to take into account all relevant available information when they assess the credit quality of their borrowers, including any investments and research activities a potential borrower has undertaken or plans to make."
"This is not new and should be expected of any bank."
"Irrespective of that, the Commission services have started a project to examine ways of promoting the use of rating systems that include technology risk assessments – in other words, technology ratings – to enable potential investors to appraise the specific risks and rewards associated with investments in technology-based SMEs."
"But, if a bank wants to use its internal ratings for regulatory capital purposes, its supervisor will need in future to check the reliability of the bank's rating system."
"That will improve the quality of the systems and ratings and is in the interest of all parties involved."
"On question 5 it is important for the Commission that the new rules are appropriate for all types and sizes of institutions, especially small banks."
"Work in Basel and Brussels reflects this in numerous areas, for example by allowing a partial use of methodologies to avoid unnecessary burdens for small credit institutions."
"Finally, on question 6, a broader range of collateral is already recognised in connection with significant improvements for loans to SMEs."
"At this stage, both the Commission and the Member States' supervisory authorities believe that a further recognition of collateral and the destandardised approach would not be justified on prudential grounds."
"The Commission services are pursuing a solution for covered bonds which appropriately reflects the risk of these instruments."
"I apologise for having been so detailed, Mr President, but the questions were also detailed and I wanted to reply in a similar vein."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, I would like to thank you for your detailed reply."
"I note – if I understood you correctly – that the Commission will, in its proposal for a directive, consider all of the points and demands I made in my question – with the exception of the area of collateral, where the process for forming an opinion has not yet been concluded."
"I would like to ask you, therefore, what consequences will result from postponing the timetable for the Basel Committee to make a decision?"
"You say that you will submit your draft directive immediately afterwards; in that case, it is likely to be autumn 2004 and that leaves a relatively tight timeframe for debates in Parliament and with the Council and a very tight timeframe for a preparatory phase for businesses before it enters into force at the end of 2006."
"What are the consequences of the new agreement in the Basel Committee and the fact that the timetable has been put back by almost a year because of the Committee’s hesitancy?"
". The Commission, as Mr Karas knows, is keen to stick to the original timetable."
"It is true that differing opinions on the other side of the ocean with respect to expected loss and unexpected loss have caused a small postponement of a few months."
"This means that the Commission will not finalise its proposal until around the middle of next year."
"It will be hard work to get everything ready for implementation at the end of 2006."
"The Commission does its best to keep pace with the developments in Basel."
"The Commission is not a Member of the Basel Committee; it is an observer and therefore in the hands of the Basel Committee as far as progress in that matter is concerned."
"However, it does its best to get everything ready on time."
"Mr Karas' main question is whether the Commission will take note of the matter he has raised, and of course the Commission will."
"Mr Karas can be assured that his opinions and questions will be taken into account."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, the case that Parliament completed the study a long time ago, and our conclusion from it is that we urgently need a training programme."
"We had already considered something to this effect in the Committee on Budgets and earmarked EUR 6 million in the budget for training related to Basel II."
"Furthermore, we have a pilot project – which we hope to be able to vote in favour of on Thursday – of EUR 91 million for building up collateral, because ultimately collateral must be built up in order to obtain a credit rating."
"I would be interested in knowing if it would still be possible for us to incorporate into the Commission study how we can best equip the training programme and how we could optimise the preparations for the introduction of Basel II in the pilot project together with the European Investment Bank and other European banks."
". The Commission is of the opinion that training programmes are important and is therefore most attentive to what Parliament decides and wishes to do in that area."
"Whether the training programmes as such will be part of the proposal to be finalised around the summer of next year, I do not know."
"After all, the training programme is one thing and the directive is something else."
"But certainly the Commission is more than willing to cooperate by giving Mr Rübig the benefit of its experience in carrying out training activities and if he would care to send a letter me along those lines, then I shall be at pains to see to it that the matter is dealt with in an adequate fashion."
"If you will allow us, Commissioner, we will put a final question."
"The system for awarding public contracts, studies and construction projects in Greece has often been described as being open to abuse, and the irregularities detected lead to delays in the completion of projects, construction faults, the submission of complaints to the Commission on the grounds of infringements of Community law (Thessaloniki metro, Ilarionas hydroelectric power station, etc), as well as the waste of Community resources."
"With specific regard to concession contracts, there is no legal framework in Greece operating alongside the rules laid down by Community law."
"On the contrary, such contracts are governed by ad hoc rules adopted for each individual case, which frequently leads to complaints being lodged with the Commission."
"To what extent are practices relating to the award of public works contracts in Greece compatible with Community law?"
"Can the Commission confirm the reports which have been published according to which the Commission has called for the suspension of payments relating to the award of studies for public works in Greece and a review of the legislative framework governing public contracts and the award of studies on the grounds of an infringement of Community law?"
"Have any complaints been lodged in relation to concession contracts, and if so, what action will the Commission take to ensure that Community law is complied with?"
". The Commission would like to recall that the public procurement directive applicable to public works was transposed into Greek law in the mid-nineties and constitutes the appropriate framework for the award of public works contracts in Greece."
"Notwithstanding the fact that the relevant EU rules seem to have been correctly transposed, the Commission examines specific cases of potential irregularities in the award of public works and work concessions, which are brought to its attention and evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether or not Community law has been breached."
"Concerning the specific question of certain public works studies, the Commission can confirm that, in the course of a regularly scheduled on-the-spot control mission concerning the Egnatia project, which is co-financed by the EU, in particular through the Trans-European Network – TEN-T – and the Structural Funds, some issues have been identified which show that the practices in Greece for the award of study contracts may not be compatible with public procurement rules and thus require further clarification."
"The Commission is in close contact with the Greek authorities in order to assess these issues."
"Whilst awaiting the outcome of the compatibility assessment under the public procurement rules, and in application of the 'precautionary principle', some of the payments, namely those linked to the TEN-T budget line, have been suspended."
"Should the competent Greek authorities not provide sufficient evidence of the compatibility of national rules or practices with the Community legislation on public procurement, the Commission will have to open an infringement procedure and thus all the EU funds concerned will have to be suspended."
"As for the last question, the Commission is not currently examining any case related to the concession of public works, nor have there been any complaints on this specific issue to date."
"I thank the Commissioner for the detailed reply which he has given to my question."
"I should like to ask him if, apart from the Egnatia Road, there are other projects which are subject to controls at the moment."
". At this moment I cannot answer the last question."
"Apart from the Egnatia case, none have been brought to my notice."
"But that does not mean that no cases are being looked into – they have simply not been brought to my notice."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your excellent cooperation beyond the agreed time limit."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 103 will be replied to in writing(6)."
"That concludes questions to the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is a sad fact, but we must face up to the reality that there are far too many drivers on our roads without sufficient insurance."
"The occurrences of personal injury and damage to property are all too frequent, despite the best efforts of our various national safety councils to reduce such tragedies."
"I commend the rapporteur for his work on this technical subject and agree fully that an appropriate level of insurance cover should also meet the cost of legal proceedings."
"These are essential, and it is appropriate that they be treated as damages to be covered by the compulsory civil liability. The conflict of interest that arises if the party's own insurers or their opponent's carry out the settlement is self-evident."
"I support the Commission's proposal that the amount of the minimum sum insured in the case of the personal injuries arising from an accident should be unlimited. Accident victims with very severe injuries such as paraplegia would not receive sufficient cover with a maximum sum of EUR 1 million."
"Mr Rothley is to be complimented once again on his wisdom and competence."
"The fact that accidents in different countries can now be dealt with in the country of the injured person is a huge plus, and I congratulate the rapporteur once again."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, for the fundamentally important work he has done with regard to this pressing issue. I was glad to see that the report takes a very similar line to that of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the problem of outstanding commitments in respect of the Structural Funds."
"The rapporteur has taken creditable account of factors that impact on the system, dealt with problematic issues critically, and proposes solutions with regard to the delays. In my opinion, the most important of these are the simplification and clarification of the system."
"Structural Funds payments have piled up to an alarming extent."
"The main procedure for controlling this trend in the current term is the n+2 rule."
"The rapporteur has found a sufficiently rigid and balanced approach to its application."
"The application of the n+2 rule is now facing its first real test, as payments requested by the end of the year are to be brought to the Commission’s attention and the overall amount will be seen."
"The Commission’s monitoring system and the way it reports to Parliament must be improved."
"One problem is the inadequate nature of Member State payment claim forecasts."
"In a system that is decentralised in the way it operates, Member States have an important responsibility for seeing to it that the system works as a whole."
"In regional policy it is time we switched from the debate on payments to one on the quality and effectiveness of measures."
"We will have the necessary ingredients for this when we have data based on the mid-term reviews."
"Above all, there must be a debate on quality and results by the Monitoring Committees at regional level."
"More reports and less bureaucracy serve as a guiding principle for better regional policy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I originally wanted to say something about the nonsensical procedure that we are going through at this witching hour, but then I saw all the young people who have been listening attentively and with great concentration, and whom, in the meantime, we seem to have lost again."
"I hope somebody explained to them why it is ..."
"… that there are so very few Members in the Chamber. That brings me back to the question of whether it makes sense to be here at this late hour."
"We few Members of this House here present know what we think. We have exchanged views in lengthy discussions in very in-depth preparatory meetings."
"It dishonours the rapporteur, who has invested so much zeal in this work, to have his words declaimed shortly before midnight to an almost empty Chamber. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses his report."
"They may well be glad when a few million euros are returned to them and can be used for this or that other purpose, but if that happens, then the Structural Funds, which were set up to benefit the most needy regions in the EU, are failing in their purpose. When we analyse the way funds are administered, we cannot but note with a critical eye the re-emergence of old familiar problems."
"It will be no simpler after the European Union gains ten new members. That is why there is a need for coordination between the actors to be simplified in order to enable EU funds to be targeted and used in a rational way."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nobody these days would dare to question the fact that the Structural Funds have been and still are an essential tool for reducing inequalities in regional development."
"It pains me greatly, therefore, to see that as much as EUR 91.6 billion in available funds – or the equivalent of the European Union’s annual budget – has not yet been used. In the run-up to the deadline for the 1994-99 programming period, there were still some 300 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programmes which had made no claims for payment whatsoever."
"Under the circumstances, such figures verge on the disgraceful. My sole consolation is the knowledge that, of all the Member States, Portugal is one of the best at implementing the Funds."
"In fact, for Community support framework II (QSF II), for which complete data have only recently become available, Portugal’s implementation rates are exemplary: 99.6% for the ERDF, 98.3% for the European Social Fund (ESF), 100% for the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund(EAGGF) and 90% for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG)."
"The causes of this under-implementation are well-known: long, complex programmes, unreliable payment forecasts and overlapping programming periods."
"I am convinced that measures such as these will not yield the results expected of them, and that some of them will even be counterproductive. The Commission should be forced to take responsibility for defining priorities, enhancing the consistency of operations and monitoring implementation, leaving the Member States solely responsible for implementing and managing structural operations."
"Apart from anything else, this under-execution of the Structural Funds is extremely bad for the image of the European Union among its citizens. Finally, as a citizen of Portugal and a native of the Algarve, I am hopeful that the forthcoming QSF-IV for 2007-2013 will continue to allow the Algarve region to benefit from structural operations, even in the context of an enlarged Europe."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the news that has already reached us via the television and to which he responded a moment ago. I hope that this Liberal initiative, which, by the way, received unanimous support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has helped you to reach your decision."
"I would like to concur with Mr Medina Ortega that we are not, in principle, opposed to a deposit system. If we want a deposit system, it would perhaps be helpful within one internal market if we were to introduce a harmonised Community system, as a result of which all businesses and all consumers within one Europe would know where they stand."
"We are against a restricting deposit system, and the voucher system in Germany does not belong in serious legislation but rather on a fairground, where it entitles you to a few rides on the merry-go-round, but not to do a few laps in Germany."
"As far as this is concerned, we are pleased with your announcement that you are going to intervene."
"What I would like to know is whether you could indicate whether it is possible to force, or at least implore, the German Government to suspend the current system with immediate effect?"
"This should happen in any event until a European-wide system has been introduced, or at least a system that complies with the current framework, so that Article 28 would not be violated. This is my first request."
"Secondly, can you confirm whether it is true – as Mr Lehne claimed – that businesses that have suffered enormous losses, but also perhaps consumers, could recoup the damage from the German Government, for example?"
"I hope that with this measure that you announced, German consumers will very soon again be able to choose freely between such European products as Badoit water, San Pellegrino or Bavaria beer."
"If this were possible, then I hope that after these ten months of being deprived of these enjoyable European products, the European market will once again be open and that it can help complete the internal market."
"I am very pleased to inform you that for the first time in a plenary sitting we have three new interpreting booths in operation."
"We can therefore have interpretation facilities into three of the new languages for today's debates: Polish, Hungarian and Czech."
"This does not alter the fact that full interpreting in all the new languages will only be available from 1 May 2004."
"So with the limited facilities available, we intend to rotate the languages so that there is equal access for all the new languages.(1)"
"Mr President, I have in front of me 26 candles."
"I am aware that this could set off a fire alarm and would therefore be grateful if you would allow me to make this point in advance of the report by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office to comment on one issue which was not raised at the summit and which the Liberal Group feels should have been raised: the continued detention without trial of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay."
"These 26 candles are a symbol that these detainees should not be forgotten and, indeed, I hope that these 26 and all 600 detainees will have access to justice."
"I would ask the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, to raise this at every opportunity with the US Administration and to place it on the agenda for the next EU-US summit."
"The President-in-Office complains that he is a victim of injustice before the law himself and so he should be particularly concerned about this very real injustice on a far greater scale."
"Exceptionally, I began with that point of order largely for safety reasons and to remove the possibility of a fire alarm."
"Having made his point, I thank Mr Watson for extinguishing the candles."
"The first item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the European Council held in Brussels on 16 and 17 October 2003, including a progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I should like to inform the House that during his last visit some months ago, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, made a number of commitments to the House on behalf of the Italian Presidency."
"Each of the commitments made to Parliament regarding our participation in the Intergovernmental Conference has been 100% delivered."
"Our colleagues Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Hänsch both participate in the Foreign Affairs meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference and do so as full participants, with a level of involvement that is unprecedented for this House with regard to such work."
"Second, I should point out that insofar as there may be a number of technical working groups on some aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament will be fully associated with the work of any such group."
"Third, for the first time ever, the President of the European Parliament has been invited by the presidency of the Council to attend and contribute to every summit meeting to be held on the Intergovernmental Conference, first in Rome on 4 October 2003, and again last week in Brussels."
"This is an exceptional and unprecedented level of engagement."
"It meets a request this House made before the Italian Presidency started: the Convention set a new method, and a new partnership is required to build a Europe that has a constitution."
"I want to place on the record on my behalf and on behalf of this House our gratitude to the presidency for delivering as promised."
". Mr President, thank you for noting that the Presidency has delivered on the commitments which I, personally, made before the House relating to the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to report on the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference and the recent European Council."
"At the opening of the Conference on 4 October 2003, the Heads of State or Government, together with the President of Parliament and the President of the European Commission, adopted the Declaration of Rome, which reaffirmed the essential role of European integration in securing peace, democracy, prosperity and solidarity in our continent."
"I want to emphasise that we have pursued our efforts in close cooperation with the European Parliament, as you mentioned, Mr President."
"The participation of President Cox in the meetings in Rome and Brussels and the participation of Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez de Vigo underscore the historic importance of the constitutional step we are in the process of taking."
"The meetings of the Conference that have been held to date have confirmed that there is broad consensus on most of the provisions drafted by the Convention."
"Differences remain regarding the specific reservations of some Member States."
"We feel that it is essential to assess the draft document produced by the Convention as a whole, with the aim of strengthening each institution while preserving the balance that has been achieved between them."
"The coming weeks will tell us whether it will be possible to achieve an agreement during the Italian Presidency."
"Moreover, the Italian Presidency reiterates its refusal to support a watered-down compromise."
"The proposal that we intend to submit in the second half of November, with a view to the final stages of negotiations, will offer worthy, noble solutions for a European Union capable of playing a leading role in bringing security, freedom and peace to the world."
"In this connection, let me recall the progress that has been made in the field of common foreign and security policy, one of the pillars of the future Constitutional Treaty."
"The debate between the Heads of State or Government of 16 October confirmed that there is consensus on the issue, which, I would say, is increasing."
"In particular, the common foreign and security policy will be all the more effective and credible if it is part of a framework that is fully compatible with and complementary to the transatlantic relationship."
"This aspect must be unambiguously reaffirmed in the future Constitutional Treaty."
"Turning to last week's European Council, the proceedings were devoted to the issues of economic growth, boosting competitiveness and immigration policy."
"The discussion revealed the shared desire for full coherence with the Lisbon Strategy."
"In particular, I would like to stress the agreement in principle on the European Initiative for Growth: an initiative that the Italian Presidency launched at the start of the six-month term and which the Commission has fully endorsed and made its own."
"The Initiative seeks to create transport infrastructure and energy and telecommunications networks, with a parallel effort to increase investment in innovation and research."
"The implementation of these projects, as regards both infrastructure and innovation and research, will have to be financed by an appropriate mix of public and private funds, which will have a key role to play here."
"The Commission has committed itself to the swift definition and launch of a package of projects for rapid implementation, with the possibility of a higher rate of cofinancing from the European Union budget."
"The conclusions of the European Council also underscore the importance of an undertaking by the Union and the individual Member States to enhance the competitiveness of the European production sector across the board."
"This emphasis is manifested in the call for rapid final approval of the Community patent regulation, the appeal to the Member States to step up the pace of transposal of Community internal market legislation into national law, and, above all, the call for rapid progress on the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan and for rapid conclusion of the work on the take-over bids directive."
"In addition, we reiterated the objective of investing 3% of GDP in research and innovation."
"The Council also reaffirmed the importance of the quality of legislation and, above all, the importance of simplification, deregulation and the efficiency and transparency of public administrations."
"Lastly, we confirmed the importance of the social dimension of European economic development."
"As regards employment, we await the report of the task force headed by Wim Kok, which will be discussed at an extraordinary Social Summit that the Presidency plans to convene on the eve of the December European Council."
"We addressed a number of aspects of social protection with a view to making open coordination of Member States’ policies in this field more effective."
"The aim is to promote and facilitate the modernisation of social protection systems in order to cope with the gradual ageing of the European population and to ensure the financial sustainability of pensionsystems."
"We felt obliged to take note of this problem collectively without, however, interfering in the decision-making independence of the individual Member States. Our purpose is to compare respective practices and to set common objectives to ensure the success of the intergenerational pact that underpins social cohesion within our societies."
"The European Council also addressed certain aspects of the programmeof workestablished at Tampere, Laeken, Seville and, lastly, Thessaloniki, regarding asylum and immigration."
"We reaffirmed our commitment to the balanced approach we have adopted thus far to the need to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and strengthen external border control, and also to develop common policies for the reception and integration of legal immigrants to Europe."
"At Thessaloniki, we set out the programme of work. At Brussels, we gave further impulse to certain specific issues."
"In the area of external border control, we noted the importance of the various joint initiatives that have been developed in recent months, which deserve better coordination."
"For this reason, we welcomed the Commission's proposal to create a Border Management Agencyto enhance the various forms of operational cooperation between the Member States for the management of external borders."
"As regards controlling migratory flows, we reaffirmed the importance of an effective common policy for readmission and return."
"We thus urged the Commission to pursue the conclusion of readmission agreements with third countries, and we welcomed the Commission's proposal to provide adequate financial support for border management and return activities."
"I believe President Prodi is going to update the House on the decisions taken in this regard."
"Lastly, we felt it necessary to confirm, once again, the importance of forging constructive partnerships with third countries, both countries of origin and transit countries, to ensure the effective management of migratory flows."
"While reaffirming full respect for national prerogatives in the sensitive area of deciding the number of legal immigrants to be admitted to their territories, we welcomed the Commission's initiation of a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration."
"I would like to pause here to recall the recent tragedy and the horror, the sorrow we felt, and also the other tragic incidents which continue to take place in the Mediterranean, just off the Italian coast, which affect us even more deeply."
"The loss of so many lives, of people driven by the force of desperation to seek a better future, must genuinely spur us to strengthen our mutual cooperation and prevent such disasters from ever happening again."
"I would also like to stress here that our Christian principles tell us that we must genuinely seek to give these immigrants a reception which is worthy of our level of civilisation, these people who leave their countries where poverty reigns and come to Europe trusting solely in their will to work and in the strength of their arms."
"I believe that we must all reflect carefully on the need for civilised Europe, Christian Europe, the Europe of prosperity, to open its doors and welcome those who come here hoping sincerely to be able to build a better future for themselves and their children."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council also considered a number of international developments that, given their urgency and importance, required the European Union to adopt a position."
"With regard to the situation in the Middle East, the Council confirmed its commitment to the position the Union has always consistently held: on the one hand, its unwavering, unconditional condemnation of terrorism and its firm demand that the Palestinian Authority display genuine, practical determination to combat extremist violence; and, on the other, its demand that the Israeli Government change its settlement policy and, in exercising its legitimate right to defend its citizens, avoid actions which might cause civilian casualties."
"Thus, Europe reiterates its determination to contribute to the implementation of all aspects of the roadmap, stressing the importance of an effective international monitoring mechanism."
"We also confirmed the urgent need for an economic plan to revive the region's economy – which we named after the plan which brought about Europe’s recovery after the Second World War, the Marshall Plan – with the support of the G8 countries and the Member States of the European Union."
"On Iraq, the Council welcomed the unanimous approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1511."
"This resolution improves the outlook for the Donors Conference, which is, as you know, to be held in Madrid on 24 October 2003."
"The European Union will make an initial pledge of EUR 200 million, already appropriated in the Community budget for 2003-2004."
"In this regard, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission were asked to develop a medium-term strategy for the European Union’s relations with Iraq and to present a progress report by March 2004."
"As regards Iran, we confirmed our attention to the deadline of the end of October established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the country to implement specific guarantees with regard to its nuclear programme."
"The Iranian Government was again called on to sign, ratify and implement promptly and unconditionally the Additional Protocol on Safeguards and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities."
"At the same time, the European Union reiterated its willingness to develop wider cooperation with Iran."
"The Italian Presidency maintained constant contact with France, Germany and the United Kingdom with regard to the mission of their Foreign Ministers to Teheran yesterday, 21 October."
"The Presidency has closely followed the developments of the initiative since its conception in July 2003, considering it part of the broad action of the European Union as regards Iran."
"We therefore welcome the positive outcome of that mission."
"This development – if confirmed – will help create the conditions agreed on by the Brussels European Council which are necessary to foster cooperation with an important partner for the stability of the region."
"The Council also addressed other developments in world affairs."
"On Kosovo, firstly, the Council urged all of the parties involved in the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to engage constructively in this process."
"As regards the Republic of Moldova, we called for the resolution of the Transdniestrian issue and reiterated our support for the OSCE's mediation efforts."
"The European Union remains attentive to developments in areas that are more distant geographically but are nevertheless linked to us by historical and cultural bonds."
"We refer to the tragic developments in the situation in Bolivia and the turbulent preparations for elections in Guatemala, and express our concern at the violence and intimidation that is dominating the pre-electoral period there."
"Lastly, I would like to note the warm congratulations extended by the European Council to His Holiness John Paul II on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of a pontificate devoted to building peace and solidarity among peoples."
"The President-in-Office of the European Council has been charged by the Council to express, on its behalf, its support for and thanks to the Pope, not least in view of the important role played by his efforts to uphold civil rights, which the Council believes directly contributed to the collapse of the regime in the Soviet Union and certainly contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"This, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the summary report of our work."
"Thank you for your attention."
". Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when I last spoke to you, I pointed out that, although the underlying fundamentals are in place, quick, decisive action is needed to pull the Union’s economy out of the current period of stagnation."
"That is why the Commission presented the European Initiative for Growth I outlined to you at the beginning of the month."
"Today, I am pleased to say that the European Council has endorsed our ideas for reviving the economy and stimulating growth and jobs."
"The Growth Initiative is simple and practical."
"It does not seek to alter the priorities of the Lisbon strategy, but to bolster and speed up its implementation."
"Its main aims will be, firstly, to overcome the barriers to coordination, especially those deriving from red tape, and, secondly, to mobilise the public and private-sector funds needed to finance certain infrastructure projects already on the drawing board and get them started."
"That is why we are preparing a quick-start list of infrastructure and research projects that are on a genuinely European scale."
"The projects selected for the quick-start list will be taken from the longer list of 29 projects put forward earlier this year."
"They will include major trans-European transport links and other projects with a high-technology content."
"The list is based on two main ideas: a desire to produce practical results quickly and the great need to ensure compatibility with the sustainable-development goals we have set ourselves."
"This desire to produce tangible results takes three main forms."
"Firstly, it takes advantage of the potential offered by a higher rate of Union cofinancing."
"Indeed, the Commission has proposed raising the Community’s contribution to 30% of the cost of the cross-border component of each project."
"This brings greater leverage in mobilising private-sector and other public-sector funding."
"Secondly, it concentrates resources on a small number of mature projects."
"The impact of investments will be all the greater if financial efforts are focused on those projects that are ready for take-off instead of being dispersed."
"Thirdly, it selects projects with the highest potential toproduce results quickly."
"This means practically resolving the most complex difficulties, particularly with a view to enlargement, creating jobs, stimulating growth and harnessing research and technological innovation potential, laying the foundations for improvements to competitiveness."
"Lastly, the quick-start list gives great consideration to compatibility, and the projects selected are sustainable in environmental as well as in economic and financial terms."
"In particular, however, the funding must comply with the Stability and Growth Pact and it must be in line with the commitment to improve the quality of expenditure, as set out in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines."
"May I express my appreciation, at this point, for the great spirit of cooperation displayed by the European Investment Bank, which has drawn up a meticulous plan for financing this Initiative and with which we are working in complete harmony."
"Of course, these are not the only projects that can be implemented under the Growth Initiative. Personally, I hope others will be added to the list."
"There are several other important aspects to this Initiative. Firstly, it defines the priorities better and more clearly and concentrates resources on the best projects; it coordinates management of operative phases of major projects better, where appropriate appointing a coordinator to help resolve difficulties holding up the completion of work; it takes the regulatory environment into account and it tackles other bureaucratic and administrative factors that have slowed up completion thus far."
"Where do we go from here?"
"The European Council has endorsed the ideas in the Initiative. Indeed, it has given the Commission the green light to prepare a detailed proposal, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, to put to the Heads of State or Government for approval in December."
"The European Council's endorsement is very good news: programmes, action plans and consensus are all very well but they will not just produce investment at the drop of a hat."
"To change things on the ground, we will need political will and a major undertaking."
"The next few months will therefore be an important test for the European Union in this area."
"In other words, if we are serious about meeting the Lisbon targets, we must hope that, in December, the European Council turns words into action and implements our proposals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the second topic I wish to report on is the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As you know, the plan is for the draft Constitution to be approved at the Brussels European Council in December."
"This will allow a new Treaty of Rome to be signed some time afterwards, at any rate before the European Parliament elections."
"If the new Constitution is to be approved in December, it is vital for the Presidency to come forward by mid-November with clear proposals that can meet with consensus."
"I would stress, here, that the Convention produced a balanced package of proposals containing some important innovations."
"Overall, we continue to regard that package as a good basis for discussion."
"Of course, the Intergovernmental Conference has to go into the points that were not addressed by the Convention or not dealt with in sufficient depth. However, there are only a very few points where the draft Constitution needs changing and the ministers' meetings of 4 and 13 October showed that many of these points concern issues that the Constitution need not settle."
"It is more appropriate for them to be dealt with in secondary legislation or in the internal rules of the various institutions. This would appear to be very important if we are to achieve effective conclusions quickly."
"Today, I just want to focus on one point that, without a doubt, does need addressing at the Conference because it is likely to become a sticking point."
"As you know, throughout the last Intergovernmental Conference, I fought for double simple majority voting in Council decision-making. Indeed, our fellow citizens would intuitively understand such a system because it would be simple and transparent."
"It would also make for more effective, streamlined decision-making. I have never concealed the fact that, on this point, I was disappointed with the outcome at Nice and I have done my best to promote a simple system: a simple majority of at least 50% of the Member States and of 50% plus one of the population."
"The draft Constitution put forward by the Convention provided for a slightly more complicated system: 50% of the Member States and 60% of the population."
"That is not quite what we had hoped for but, overall, I feel it is still a satisfactory solution, for it is simple and transparent and means decisions can be taken."
"In practical terms, under this system, decisions have practically the same chances of being adopted successfully as under the extremely complex weighting system concocted at Nice."
"There are some, however, who would now like to raise the figure for a qualified majority to 66% of the population."
"We must strongly oppose this idea, which seeks to overturn the balance crafted by the Convention."
"Looking at the possible consequences, it would make it so much easier for a small minority to block an initiative and hamstring the Union."
"In the way it is made up, as we have already said, the Commission must reflect all national perspectives."
"Moreover, even the Convention came out in favour of a Commission comprising one Commissioner from each Member State."
"Little consideration has been given to this, but the Convention’s proposal isone Commissioner per Member State."
"However, the structure proposed was complicated and, in my opinion, unworkable."
"Our proposal must not, therefore, be seen as reopening the constitutional package – there is already one Commissioner per Member State – but, in actual fact, as a contribution to a final compromise."
"The proof is that a majority of countries are clearly in favour of a Commission with Commissioners coming from each Member State of the Union and all enjoying the same voting rights."
"That is the difference."
"This could bring us closer to a balanced, politically acceptable solution."
"The Commission has already put forward suggestions for organising an enlarged Commission that would ensure it is effective in decision-making terms as well as having full legitimacy."
"Anyone who imagines the Commission is seeking to introduce a here or that we could stray so far from the vision of the founding fathers is, therefore, way off track."
"The Commission can play its political role only if it can assert a legitimacy and credibility of its own, and these derive from its close link with national cultures and perspectives across the whole Union."
"Lastly, there is a third point which it is absolutely vital to address: ensuring that the Constitution can be amended in the future."
"We are aware that, if changes have to be agreed and ratified unanimously by 25 or more different parties, this will mean, in practice, that the Constitution cannot be amended."
"Any reform will be completely impossible."
"Remember – and, here, since everyone else is doing so, I really do want to recall the great battle that took place over the wording of the US Constitution – that, if it cannot be amended, our Constitution will not be workable and will fall apart at the very first hitch."
"An inflexible Constitution is worse than nothing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen from these brief words, the European Union needs a dynamic economy and a sound Constitution."
"We must muster the strength of the large Member States and rally the support of the smaller for the good of all."
"We must release all our existing energies and harness our resources to the full."
"When we speak of harnessing our resources to the full, I am also thinking of the resources we draw from legal immigration – which the President-in-Office of the Council rightly mentioned – the immigrants that form the bulk of the workforce for those jobs that our young people no longer want to do – there is no point in pretending this is not the case – and the highly qualified technicians we vitally need for our industry and our economy."
"The whole phenomenon of migration is very difficult to manage, both in terms of the need to integrate legal immigrants, who must share in the rights that our society guarantees to all its citizens, and in terms of combating illegal immigration and the latter-day trade in human beings that violates all our values so intolerably."
"This is not a burden that we can leave the individual Member States to bear, not least because it would be heavier for some Member States than others."
"Today, no one can cope with it satisfactorily, given the lack of a single EU policy approach to the phenomenon."
"The Commission has done its part and perhaps even more than its duty, for many of our proposals have not been accepted. There was the Tampere programme and the Thessaloniki programme too."
"Now we have undertaken to adopt a proposal very quickly on an agency for the common management of borders."
"That is a lot, and I am happy to acknowledge it, but it is not enough."
"It is clear from what Mr Berlusconi said that the problem continues to have very tragic consequences and that it may even be growing."
"A single policy approach is needed and funding will have to be found to implement it."
"Common channels must be defined for legal immigration and a global negotiation organised on that basis with the countries of emigration, the countries of provenance of immigrants."
"Moreover – to show you the full extent of the problems – these countries need to have such legal lists so they can step up measures to discourage these desperate attempts by illegal immigrants."
"We must guarantee to these countries that at least a minimal amount of their emigration can be regularised; in other words, there must be cooperation between us."
"It was not possible to achieve this at the last Council, but the Commission will strike out once again along this road because we see it as the only way of actively managing immigration, both legal and illegal."
"I cannot close my eyes to these recurring tragedies that have been mentioned."
"We cannot close our eyes to them, and the Commission certainly will not."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference was at the heart of the Brussels Summit, and our group welcomes the Italian Presidency’s determination and goodwill in intending to come up with a result in time for the Summit on 12/13 December."
"We wish to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your endeavours to bring this about, for, if the Intergovernmental Conference drags itself out into 2004, there is an even greater risk of further chapters being opened, with the result that we will not come to a conclusion."
"We therefore urge you to do everything to enable a result to be achieved under your presidency."
"We are alongside you in doing so."
"As regards the institutional issues, we urge that any solution to the problem of the Commission’s composition should be satisfactory to both the large and small countries."
"We warn against the mere acknowledgement that the larger countries have claims, for the smaller ones, too, are entitled to appropriate representation, and this is an issue I wish you much success in resolving."
"If you manage to do so, then it will also be possible to resolve the issue of the European Council’s Presidency and of its composition."
"As regards the voting in the Council of Ministers, the overwhelming majority in our group is not of one mind; there are one or two exceptions, but the overwhelming majority favours the dual-majority principle as proposed by the Convention."
"We take the view that the Convent has put before us a proposal that is in line with the Community method, and one that we should allow to succeed."
"Turning to the Legislative Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we insist that transparency and continuity be introduced into the legislative work of the European Council of Ministers."
"This is an area in which we must not revert to old-style secret diplomacy, with it not being known what goes on behind the doors of the Council of Ministers."
"One problem that we must resolve is the Maastricht issue, that of price stability."
"Although price stability is a constituent element in the Constitution, nowhere do we see the 3% deficit limit being kept to, and general requirement to maintain price stability is of little use if it lacks an explicit basis."
"We therefore ask that it be ensured that clear and quantifiable bases, with reference to protocols, are in place in order that price stability should not exist merely in theory, but may, in practical terms too, remain a central element in our common policy."
"If I may comment on the external borders, it is with great joy that I have heard that Mr Berlusconi, the President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, have come to an agreement on immigration matters."
"We in the European Union do, of course, need our external borders to be protected, but our concern is that protection of the external borders resolves only part of the problem, which is a profoundly human one."
"The sight of wretched, hungry, thirsty people, including children – such as we have seen on the shores of the island of Lampedusa – shows that this is not just about the protection of our external borders, but about these pitiable people being given a chance in their own countries and not needing to get in their boats."
"That is why it is important that border controls should be carried out within the countries from which these people emigrate and that developments in them should be brought to completion so as to make it possible for young people to look forward to a proper, good, and decent future in their own homeland."
"To that end, we, the European Union, have our own contribution to make in the Mediterranean region."
"The word ‘Guantanamo’ featured in my notes – with which I can now dispense – even before we heard of Mr Watson’s symbolic and expressive action in the Chamber."
"We take the view that major problems are adequately addressed by the use of persuasion."
"Our concern is not only with the twenty-six Europeans, but also with all those who are detained in Guantanamo."
"Whilst we are all in favour of combating terrorism, our Christian conception of man teaches us that every human being, even the worst of criminals, has the right to be tried in accordance with the law."
"We therefore appeal to our American friends to abide by the principles of human rights."
"Consider, if you will, that these 600 detainees include five or six who have done nothing."
"What harm is being done to these people, and how unjustly they are being treated!"
"That is the actual crux of our European attitude to the death penalty."
"Even if only one person is wrongly executed, that is sufficient reason to deny the death penalty any justification whatever."
"What I say to the Americans I say as one who thinks of himself as one of their friends, urging them to understand our position, which is founded on the rule of law and on human dignity, that every human being is of equal worth, whatever the colour of their skin, their gender, or their nationality."
"Let me turn, for my final comments, to the subject of European defence."
"I speak as one who had the pleasure of serving for ten years as chairman of Parliament’s security and disarmament subcommittee, when we always supported Europe’s strong defence capacity as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance."
"We want the North Atlantic Alliance to be founded on the twin pillars of Europe and the USA, and we would ask our American friends to understand why we are reinforcing Europe’s defences."
"Far from this being in opposition to the US, we seek to complement each other, and want to be strong together."
"At the heart of this is our joining in defending our common values."
"It is on that foundation that any common European defence policy must rest."
"– Mr President, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the President—in-Office of the Council on the Brussels Summit offers us – to put it in artistic terms – a sketch, an outline in chiaroscuro, because a very important challenge for the whole of Europe is being faced, which is to draw up the Constitution and also to organise our territory."
"It makes good sense, therefore, at the same time as the Constitution, to talk about the networks of arteries and nerves – the infrastructure networks – which give structure to something which is more than just a market: a project aimed at sharing our lives."
"With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I must express my group’s concern, because it gives the impression that it is producing a litany, a repetition of positions, and is not getting down to solving problems."
"I must say that we are very concerned about the fact that the first decision to be made – with the opposition of the representatives of Parliament – has been to remove the Legislative Council."
"This is very important, because we are in a Parliament and, having achieved shared legislative power for the first time, the Conference’s first decision has been to eliminate the possibility of legislating jointly with us."
"I would therefore ask that this mistaken decision be reconsidered."
"With regard to the voting system, we have three problems which must be resolved jointly: the composition of the Commission, the Presidency of the Council and the voting system."
"In this regard, I must say that, for our part, on the basis that our thinking involves how to make decisions together – and not how to block them – we support the system of double majority, as proposed by the Convention."
"I would draw attention to an aspect which is important to Parliament: do not use Parliamentary seats as jokers for concluding your negotiations."
"This is a much more serious issue."
"With regard to the draft Constitution, I would also like to point out that the economic issue demonstrates the insufficiency of an important matter: the regulation of economic governance."
"This is a very important problem in terms of price stability and also in terms of how we take coherent decisions, not only on monetary policy but also on economic policy."
"Finally, the issue of revising the Constitution is essential since a Constitution cannot be closed completely."
"That would make it completely useless."
"With regard to Guantánamo – on which we held a hearing with other political groups in Parliament in order to debate the issue – I must say that at the moment we have European citizenship in the Constitution."
"However, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is the governments of the Member States which have to defend the European citizens."
"I would ask you to urge the governments to take on their responsibilities."
"With regard to the economy, what you have done has been basically to rescue the Delors Plan – ten years later – to overcome the Ecofin Council's veto – which has been blocking this plan – and now you are proposing a series of actions which would really make sense, including the launch of a European loan, because here there is talk of how well the European Investment Bank can do it, but we will have to see whether private capital – of which there is plenty – is offered."
"This is an important issue which has not been clarified."
"I must say, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, that with the cardinal’s language you have used, what you are proposing are recommendations to the national governments."
"It is not the European Parliament which is holding up the European patent."
"We are not holding up the transposition of regulations: it is the ministers and their governments who have to obey you."
"It is not for you to give advice, but to order your own governments to implement the policies you decide on."
"This is truly notable because it is a kind of litany which is repeated systematically."
"With regard to employment, we eagerly await the Koch report and it makes sense to talk about the issue which was launched under the Swedish Presidency of the European demographic autumn in relation to pensions and immigration."
"On immigration and the decisions of the European Council in Thessaloniki, I would like to say to you, Mr President, given that Europe is secular and that European values are not the monopoly of any single religion – for the first time in history, fortunately – that we share in the regrets and condolences over what is happening."
"I must also say that in your government there are people who are doing positive work – and we are quite happy to recognise it: Mr Pisanu is demonstrating serious political responsibility in the face of absolutely intolerable and xenophobic attitudes on the part of other members of your government."
"Mr Pisanu is taking the same approach as another Italian Interior Minister – Mr Napolitano – who was the person who initiated the policy of agreements with countries from which immigrants originate, a policy which should be developed, and I do not believe it is sufficient to talk about the Borders Agency, we should talk about co-development and quotas, and you must reach an agreement on this."
"This is the approach which really makes sense for the future."
"Finally, Mr President, as well as our group’s belief in the importance of the step forward in terms of European defence, in relation to external relations I would like to say that my group welcomes and supports the decision of this Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan, to the United Nations staff who have died and also in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello."
"I understand, Mr President, from what I heard in the United Nations last week, that Mr Kofi Annan has agreed to come here in January."
"I believe we should support that decision."
"Finally, turning to the so-called Conference of Donors in Madrid, our group fully supports the proposal approved by the European Council to contribute EUR 200 million."
"The only thing we wish to point out is that the US Senate, when President Bush asked them for aid, divided the aid: half in loans and half in donations."
"In other words, we do not need to go further than the United States which, in principle, has taken a step forward by returning to the United Nations, but in a situation in which it is increasingly necessary to have a timetable for returning sovereignty to the Iraqi people."
"I should like to take this opportunity to inform the House that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, will address our plenary session in Brussels on 29 January 2004."
"We very much look forward to that."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group in this House welcomes the Italian Presidency's initiative to associate the President of this House more closely with the work of the European Council."
"Nonetheless the overwhelming feeling of the European Liberal Democrats is one of disappointment at the outcome of the European Council."
"We fear that it may be recalled, if at all, as a summit distinguished more by what it failed to discuss and agree than for what it actually achieved."
"One issue that was not raised is the continued detention, without charge or trial, of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba of whom I spoke earlier. As a symbol for them, I have in front of me 26 candles."
"I am sorry that the President-in- Office did not respond to my invitation to say a few words this morning about the continued detention of those European nationals and, indeed, of all 600 detainees."
"It seems to my Group that their detention without charge is a scandal and that the failure of European Union leaders in the Council presidency to keep the matter on their radar screen must be remedied."
"This House is no less concerned by the situation in Chechnya."
"The wrongs which are being committed daily, in the name of the fight against terrorism, will hasten the rainfall of revenge which refills the tributaries of terror."
"With less than two months to go until the end-of-the-year summit, by which time we are supposed to reach agreement on a new Constitution, the presidency had no time to lose."
"We fear that an opportunity for progress may have been missed."
"But handed an agenda with little real substance, EU leaders gave back even less."
"I question whether it was wise for the Italian Presidency not to push for decisions on the Constitution or to make compromise proposals now rather than leaving things to November."
"That may be too late – politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum."
"The lack of proposals has encouraged some countries to retreat from the Convention's agreement, and Poland and Spain to get a hearing for their self-interested sentimentality for the discarded agreements of Nice."
"The crucial common defence clauses were discussed 'over dinner' but apart from Mr Blair's welcome U-turn on structured cooperation, we appear to have achieved little apart from giving America indigestion."
"Nor was there substantive progress on economic reform."
"While we welcome the European growth initiative and the refocusing away from spending on white elephant transport projects towards investment in R[amp]D, the real focus to get back to growth must be progress on structural reform."
"We would have liked to see the Council putting its legislative money where its mouth is and building the dynamic, open economy we were promised at Lisbon."
"Progress on Justice and Home Affairs was limited, with little forward movement on the important issues of immigration and asylum."
"The one positive development, the creation of a European agency to manage the security of our expanding borders, was again agreed beforehand and merely rubber-stamped."
"The flip side of the coin is the proposal for biometric indicators for passports and visas which should have set civil liberty alarm bells ringing loudly but which seemed not to trouble the summit at all."
"President-in-Office, much rests on your November compromise text for the Constitution."
"It will be your last throw of the dice and we wish you luck since we fear you may need it!"
"I should like to remind the House that last week the Conference of Presidents invited the Council and the Commission to make statements this afternoon on the issue of Chechnya."
"I understand that will indeed take place during the afternoon."
"Mr President, I am sure we all remember the heartfelt cry Mr Giscard d'Estaing gave here on 3 September: ‘Never forget the citizens!’"
"Our Heads of State or Government have clearly failed to take this piece of friendly advice."
"The impression that they give of their exchanges on the draft constitution is rather pathetic and takes us back in time: this is Nice all over again."
"The problem is not that the issues they addressed are not worthy ones."
"They are, however, entirely cut off from what most citizens consider to be the crucial issues: what are the ambitions for the future Union?"
"How much will is there to change the course of the current trend of globalisation? Consequently, the discussions taking place unfortunately resemble a power struggle, lacking any vision capable of capturing the people’s imagination."
"I believe that the European idea is frankly worth more than that."
"Some observations made by the President of the Commission in his letter to the President-in-Office of the Council also appear to be incapable of stimulating any kind of excitement about Europe amongst the general public."
"His remarks suggest that European citizens increasingly feel it is important for the Union to press ahead with the structural reforms decided on at Lisbon."
"These are the proposed reforms on retirement pensions, on social protection, on the labour market, on public services, and yet it is precisely this type of measure that is increasingly frequently setting workers, pensioners and the unemployed, from Rome to Paris, via Berlin, against this caricature of harmonising European policy."
"What, furthermore, are we supposed to think about the aim stated in the same letter and I quote, ‘to speed up the adoption, at European level, of measures that will enable us to exploit the potential of legal immigrants, while maintaining a firm stance in the fight against illegal immigration’."
"Does this two-pronged approach really express the concept of Europe-South relations that we wish to promote in the eyes of our fellow citizens?"
"It will definitely grate on the young people who have embraced the idea that another world is possible, a world without predators and without fortresses. These young people feel that a genuine and proactive development policy that gives new hope to the peoples of the South must underpin the solution to the problem of people immigrating in order to survive."
"More generally, however, is it not time to show the entire European public that the essentially utilitarian and security-based approach to immigration is a dead end, as demonstrated by the unbearable and endlessly repeated tragedies such as the recent example that occurred in the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, lastly, and in conclusion, I wish on behalf of my group to put forward a practical, constructive and achievable proposal, which would enable you to make one of those gestures that honour the Union in the eyes of our fellow citizens, because they really bring to life the values that we claim imbue our texts."
"This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East."
"As you know, extremely courageous men and women, both Palestinian and Israeli, have spent two years working on a new peace plan, without sidestepping any of the problems that have impeded all official negotiations to date."
"Some of these people are eminently representative individuals from the fields of politics, the military and culture, including the former Speaker of the Knesset, Avram Burg, with whom we are all familiar."
"This plan has just been made public and this afternoon, two of its creators, Naomi Shazan, former deputy Speaker of the Knesset and Mr Jamal Zakoud from the Palestinian Legislative Council will join us."
"At 4 p.m., they will present their historic initiative to all Members who wish to hear. Beforehand, President Cox will receive them and I wish to thank him for doing so."
"I propose, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, that you also receive these individuals and that you honour with your presence, or that at least the Council and the Commission honour with their presence, the formal signing of this peace plan in Geneva on 4 November, the anniversary of Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination."
"This would be a gesture for peace and what gesture could better stamp Europe’s identity on the world stage?"
"Mr President-in-Office, it may be true that six months is too short a time to make any real headway on matters but it is an even shorter time if one has the tendency to waste time holding meetings of Heads of State which serve no purpose, being merely expensive repetitions of debates already held at Foreign Minister level."
"The Italian Presidency should have presented some conclusive documents at Brussels to attempt to resolve issues which have been staring us in the face for months."
"There have been enough questionnaires: now it is time to provide some answers."
"In this connection, I would like briefly to mention the Legislative Council."
"We believe that this is a genuine question of democracy."
"As Mr Frattini said yesterday, there is a discrepancy between what many governments are imposing and what the overwhelming majority of parliaments wants."
"The Legislative Council is essential to ensure democratic control and the separation of powers, and, today, we would like your government to provide guarantees on this matter."
"The Intergovernmental Conference, with its gridlock, the debates of pernickety haggling over figures and percentages which are so reminiscent of the nights of Nice, leaves us somewhat nostalgic for the Convention, which, with all its shortcomings, successfully debated the common future of the Europeans and how to govern them."
"A word about the Lampedusa tragedy: these are not immigrants, they are refugees, and there are proposals gathering dust in the Council on the legal framework for immigration and the definition of refugee while the different governments continue to exchange proposals."
"Mr President-in-Office, find a solution to the matter."
"That will be worth much more than many words."
"The spirit of Nice is also hovering over the lengthy list of bridges and motorways which the Italian Presidency and Commissioner de Palacio wish to give us."
"With regard to the famous list of trans-European transport networks, all we hear today are the cries of the two categories of interested parties: those lamenting the inclusion of a particular tunnel or corridor and those who are champing at the bit and want to start building as soon as possible."
"There is no discussion of the quality of these investments or whether they are necessary; everyone is treating the issue as though it were a matter of national prestige."
"Proof of this is the Italian Government’s barely disguised attempt to put increasingly unceremonious pressure on France, which is rightly unsure as to the need for the Turin-Lyon tunnel."
"It is genuinely embarrassing, Mr President-in-Office, for a large country such as Italy to have to bargain for an unsustainable tunnel with a dubious electricity investment, especially if we consider the truly non-European nature of Mr Lunardi’s conflict of interests with regard to this project."
"We continue, undeterred, to say that what would help to genuinely boost environmentally and socially sustainable growth in Europe now is a kind of Marshall Plan – a different sort of Marshall plan, promoting useful infrastructure but also renewable energies, land regeneration, research and innovation."
"Every day, kilometres upon kilometres of railway branch lines are closed in the countries soon to join the Union, leaving thousands of citizens with no transport: this is further evidence of the fact that the mobility problems are not going to be solved by the airy-fairy promise of trans-European networks."
"We call upon the Commission not to continue merely to rubber stamp demands from various quarters but to return to its key task: pursuing the interests of Union."
"It would appear that there is going to be a new list, known as the quick-start list."
"Without further ado, we would say to President Prodi that we greatly welcome the idea, particularly if this new list is based on the quality of the work and its social and environmental sustainability, unlike the Van Miert list organised by Commissioner de Palacio."
"We must remember – since the Commission and the Council appear to have forgotten – that Parliament has power of codecision on this matter and we intend to make full use of it."
"Mr President, we see the decision taken by the Council to transfer analysis of the chemicals legislation to the Competitiveness Council as a defeat for all those who care about citizens’ health and as a victory for the great chemical industry."
"Clearly, the decision was affected by the reluctance and delays on the part of the Commission in presenting its proposal and by the excessive consideration it gave to lobbies, as well as by its serious oversight in failing to incorporate the demands of civil society during an extremely long pretence at consultation."
"It is to protect health and the environment, not to promote competitiveness or trade, that it was decided to draw up a proposal on this matter in 1998."
"We will hold fast tothis line and we are ready to give battle, alongside the environmental and consumer associations, out of respect for all those workers who continue to fall ill and die in Europe and throughout the world."
"Mr Watson started with an evocative reminder of the appalling situation in Guantánamo, but I would stress my disappointment at the fact that there has been no mention of the 11 000 prisoners, or detainees, we might say, being held by the United States in Baghdad: they are not Europeans but they, too, have rights."
"We repeat our proposal once again here: we must suspend the entry into force of the extradition agreement with the United States in order to put pressure on the United States in this matter."
"One last point, Mr President-in-Office: as you know, the European Parliament is extremely sensitive to the question of its citizens’ rights."
"In July, Parliament called upon Italy to do something about the case of Adriano Sofri, turning it into a European issue."
"We are confident that you will respond to that call: you have the capacity to do so."
"As Europeans, we feel it is genuinely distressing to see the entire Italian Government, and the will of the President, too, so completely at the mercy of the whims of a minister."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Presidents, I wish to say first of all that I believe the criticism made of the outcome of the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference is exaggerated, not to say inappropriate."
"I must first say to the President of the Commission that, for once, I am satisfied with his proposals, and I am similarly satisfied with the proposals of the European Council concerning the initiative for growth."
"This initiative is indeed crucial, as is linking private funds to public funds in order to ensure that our economy develops more effectively."
"For that to happen, however, all of our countries must adopt a number of measures to encourage private investment and, in particular, we must ensure that the red tape of the European Commission and the consequences thereof do not add to the red tape that already exists in each of our countries."
"Having said that, I believe that this is a step in the right direction."
"Secondly, what upsets the previous speakers is something that I personally find reassuring."
"By this I mean that some of our fellow Members are rather naïve."
"There is, as we know, a federalist majority here, which expressed its views when the work of the Convention was approved."
"This approval was accompanied by a degree of pretentiousness, not to say considerable arrogance, in claiming that the Heads of State or Government, who are in fact the sole source of national legitimacy in each of our countries, would not have the right to table any proposals for amendments whatsoever."
"By the same token, these federalist members were also extremely naïve to think that the countries joining the European Union would be satisfied with a minor role for their ‘pretend’ Commissioners."
"Do not be surprised then, at the results that you get."
"I agree with Lenin, who said that facts are stubborn: you are facing the facts, so acknowledge them!"
"Mr President, the Brussels Summit brought the common border police force that much closer."
"Soon, we shall have common monitoring of the EU’s external borders, just as we had in the old days around our own country."
"The EU state proceeds according to plan."
"So does the EU Constitution."
"Work is now being done on the basis of the draft produced by the Convention."
"There will, however, be a Commissioner from each country, because a number of countries cannot get the Constitution accepted without national Commissioners."
"We also want the countries themselves to choose the Commissioners and for there to be complete equality between the countries in the chairing of Council of Ministers meetings."
"There is now a danger of there being group presidencies, with three or four countries leading the EU for 18 to 24 months and, in practice, the possibility of the largest country in the group taking charge of the most important tasks."
"It would be wiser to continue with the current rotation scheme in which countries can concentrate for six months on delivering a proper presidency."
"To limit the burden of work, the individual Council formations and, in particular, the 297 working parties in the Council might be given the option of selecting their own chairman from among themselves on the basis of a combination of fair rotation and the chairman’s personal qualifications for presiding over the meetings."
"Allow me especially to warn against what are known as the passerelles – or one-way motorways – in which the prime ministers are themselves left to define the borders between the EU and the nation states and are able to extend the scope of EU cooperation by means of the flexibility clause in Article 17."
"They are able to introduce the ordinary legislative procedure and move from unanimity to decisions by qualified majority through Article 24(4) and, for example, with reference to Article 39(8) in the case of foreign policy."
"If the three methods are combined, almost all issues may fall within EU competence."
"Instead, for example, of the Danish Prime Minister’s desire for a catalogue of competences with a clear division of power between the EU and the Member States, we get unrestricted prime ministerial government and much more centralisation of legislative power in Brussels."
"We must now hope that all the EU countries will hold referendums on the draft Constitution."
"It is absurd that Mr Blair should have held referendums on regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales and on the municipal government in London but will not allow a referendum on Great Britain’s first written Constitution."
"Take courage, Mr Blair, it is not enough to hold a referendum on a new constitution in Iraq."
"– Mr President, Mr Pasqua was right to say that this is the European Parliament he knows: this is the result of the anti-European positions of De Gaulle, not of the Europe which Winston Churchill called upon in 1946 in Zurich to stand up, talking about a ‘United States of Europe’."
"Here, we have the disunited states of Europe, we have bureaucracies that are destroying each other and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have a Council which was called upon by Parliament in July to appoint a European representative for the Caucasus and, on 4 September, and, again, on 24 September, to appoint a representative for Iraq."
"We will not be giving anything to Chechnya, suffering from genocide, or to alleviate the situation in Iraq, apart from that shameful little bribe worthy of the dealers of southern Italy, apart from 200 million out of 35 billion."
"Look at Europe, this Europe!"
"With regard to Israel, Iraq, Chechnya and, I am sure, Guantánamo, Europe roars at the United States and brays at Russia, China, Chechnya and Vietnam."
"Clearly, then, I cannot say we are laying too much blame at the door of the Italian Presidency."
"The draft Constitution, which has been laid before us with so much hype, is no more than a formless, empty, pretentious mass which has no basis in the constitutional law with which the world is familiar."
"As regards the rule of law and the liberal states, it makes overambitious, presumptuous demands, and it cannot even stand the test now, in its initial stages; just imagine how effective it will be when the time comes to implement it."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, despite the calls from the European Parliament, you have not yet produced an informal draft on the death penalty and we are almost at the end of the UN General Assembly."
"On this, we can wait: Israel can wait, Turkey can wait and we European federalists of the great pro-European tradition of Italy and many other parts of Europe can wait too."
"Mr President, with less passion than the previous speaker, but with at least as much conviction, I would like to say that I feel a sense of frustration over the way in which the Intergovernmental Conference is developing."
"I feel this sense of frustration firstly because I believe that we have lost the spirit of the Convention, which consisted of seeking the best for the future of the Europe of 25, and my respected friend, Mr Pasqua, recalled Lenin when he said that facts are stubborn."
"What is more, they really are, because those governments which have to approve the Constitution had a presence in the Convention and actively participated in it, and I believe that nobody should go against their own actions."
"I feel frustration, Mr President, because I have the feeling that we are going to see over the coming days an attempt to reopen all the issues dealt with in the Convention."
"The Italian Presidency has sent a proposal telling the governments what has to be dealt with in the Convention."
"The response has been 150 pages of proposals to reopen almost all the issues that the Convention dealt with."
"There is also something entirely paradoxical, which is that certain formations of the Council of Ministers – such as the Ecofin Council – are also making proposals to revise the Constitution."
"The worst thing about these proposals, ladies and gentlemen, is that none of them are ambitious, none of them go further than the Constitutional text."
"They are cheapskate proposals."
"In reality, moreover, the Constitutional text could have been more ambitious."
"I will give an example of what I mean: Part IV, which refers to the revision of the constitutional text, was dealt with very little in the Convention, due to lack of time, and President Giscard d’Estaing even promised that we would discuss it after Thessaloniki."
"Well this has not happened."
"Here we have enormous scope for making specific proposals."
"There is no specific proposal in this regard, however."
"I also feel frustrated because the spirit of the Convention is a spirit of compromise, but compromise by blocks."
"But I notice that there are proposals, for example, which seek to reform the budgetary procedure."
"But this cannot be dealt with separately."
"It forms a package with the financial perspectives and with own resources."
"And if we, as the European Parliament, accept the package, we cannot accept now that one part should be left as it is and that the agreement on the budgetary procedure should be broken."
"I therefore believe that the Intergovernmental Conference must concentrate on genuinely political issues, which have not yet been resolved, on which there is no consensus between the governments and which are very simple: the presidency of the Council and the rotating presidencies, the weighting of votes and the distribution of seats in the European Parliament and the number of Commissioners."
"Constructive proposals – and I would urge the Italian Presidency to make some – must be presented en bloc and must not be piecemeal."
"I have therefore once again failed to understand today – and I say this because I am concerned – the speech by the President of the Commission when he says that the weighting of votes is very good, but that, on the other hand, the number of Commissioners must be changed."
"We cannot accept the parts of proposals that we want and reject the rest."
"We will have to seek a compromise solution and I hope that the Italian Presidency will do so and do so quickly."
"Mr President, I will just focus on the issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference, although, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you were very restrained on this subject too, as, moreover, were the Council’s conclusions of 16 October, which devoted a mere eight and a half lines to it."
"Yesterday, however, Mr Frattini and I were able to discuss the matter in depth in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs’ meeting open to the national parliaments, and I want to mention concerns and critical points expressed at that meeting, which have been echoed just now by Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I would like to make one thing absolutely clear."
"There is no prejudice towards the Italian Presidency whatsoever in Parliament."
"Quite the opposite: we know we are indebted to Italy for the major contributions it has made to European integration at crucial times as a founder country."
"The Italian Presidency’s problem is now how to live up to this reputation, following on in the highest tradition of Italian Europeanism."
"Why are we concerned?"
"Because a significant number of governments have shown a tendency to challenge some of the most important innovations of the draft Convention."
"How should we respond to this tendency?"
"That is the question."
"The way the Ministerial Meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference started alarmed us."
"We know what happened, even though you have not mentioned it, Mr Berlusconi."
"The debate started with the new development introduced by the Convention’s draft regarding the operation of the Union’s legislative process, which is no longer to be dispersed among the many different configurations of the Council of Ministers, but with legislative powers being concentrated in a single General and Legislative Affairs Council instead."
"In the questionnaire-based consultation which took place before the debate between Foreign Affairs Ministers, a large number of the governments said ‘no’, although we do not know what their reasons were."
"However, the representatives of all the governments which are now opposed to the idea had accepted this innovation as part of the final overall compromise of the Convention."
"The issue of the Legislative Council is not insignificant."
"I do not have the time to explain why now, but we are alarmed by what happened regarding the issue of the Legislative Council at the Ministerial Meeting of the IGC."
"The issue cannot and must not be considered closed."
"If it were to be considered closed, we would not be facing an unacceptable compromise but total surrender."
"Moreover, just as, with their unequivocal refusals, many governments have put a stopper on the introduction of the Legislative Council, they could do the same thing on other, equally or even more important, key points of the draft Convention."
"This way of doing things is unacceptable."
"The Presidency must only take into consideration calls for amendments for which there is clear, long-term justification."
"It is the Presidency’s task to display the necessary ability for persuasion and drive, confident in the knowledge, Mr Berlusconi, that it represents not only Italy’s position but all the positions and groupings which contributed to the conclusion agreed upon by the Convention."
"These groupings include the parliaments – we must never forget that: the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments, in other words the direct representatives, legitimised by the vote of the citizens, the peoples of the Union."
"The broad consensus and the goodwill displayed by the Heads of State or Government at the inaugural meeting of the IGC in Rome cannot be relied on if the respective Foreign Ministers start to pull to pieces or chop up the Convention’s draft immediately afterwards."
"Beware of rhetoric!"
"As you said last time – and it had to be said – the European interest must prevail over national interests, but the danger – which is clear to see – is that it is not even the protection of fundamental national interests that will prevail but the upholding of minor positions of interest."
"Therefore, Mr Berlusconi, we fear that the analogy taken from Hemingway cited in this House by Mr Altiero Spinelli when his draft was being adopted and he was less than certain as to its fate, an analogy used again in recent days by Mr Amato, will become reality."
"He said that the big fish we think we have caught with the draft Convention is in danger of being reduced to its backbone, for the sharks have taken away the meat."
"We must do everything possible to stop this happening."
"I could not interrupt a Hemingway quotation, but I would urge colleagues to keep to their speaking time!"
"Mr President-in-Office, will the Italian Presidency succeed at this historic time for the Constitution and European integration?"
"My hope, right up to the last, will be that the fruits of the Convention mature and are harvested in the interests of Europe."
"I would like to consult you on two political considerations as you approach the final two months of your presidency."
"The first consideration is radical, practical and symbolic all at once: we expect the Italian Presidency, together with the Commission, to lay the foundations for genuine-level European financing, controls and sanctions in the field of immigration."
"We expect more than just general intentions now; we expect progress to be made at last by one of the very countries which is most affected by the situation."
"Mr President-in-Office, I also expect an initiative from the Council you head on the situation in Iraq."
"The unanimous vote in the Security Council may lead to a new way forward."
"The European members of the Security Council have, at last, come to an agreement, and now the Council has to turn that compromise into an initiative: there can and must be a return to multilateralism, we can work together in the field of reconstruction, the humanitarian crisis, security and the democratic transition to Iraqi sovereignty in Iraq under the mandate and guidance of the United Nations."
"Mr President-in-Office, as a European, I cannot fail to express my deep concern at the way the Intergovernmental Conference is being conducted."
"You have confirmed the intention to conclude the work before December, remaining as faithful as possible to the Convention’s text without substantial compromises."
"However, it would appear that, thus far, the Italian Presidency has limited itself to taking note of and recording the positive and negative opinions of the various delegations on the different issues, with the danger, not least, that debates will be reopened on matters which were considered settled."
"Europe, however, as Mr Watson pointed out, does not need a Presidency which is content merely to rubber-stamp initiatives or act as a referee; it does not need pedantic lists of the different demands."
"Now is the time for leadership which will provide farsighted, wise guidance."
"President Prodi is right: an inflexible Constitution would inevitably fail."
"I therefore hope that precisely Italy, which, in 1985, succeeded with the IGC that led to the Single Act in achieving the impossible, will, in 2003, live up to its Europeanist traditions and help to launch a constitutional text which is flexible enough to be workable and convincing enough to be a reference point for European development over the next 50 years."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, to be honest, I have to say that this debate is, quite frankly, schizophrenic."
"The policies put forward by the President-in-Office of the Council can only be considered if we disregard the actual situation in Europe."
"You talk of changes to the pension system in order to preserve social cohesion."
"Mr President-in-Office, it is sufficient to look at your own country: a general strike of all the trades union has been called for the day after tomorrow in protest against your pensions policy, including the organisations which signed the Pact for Italy with you."
"Does the fact that all the workers are opposed to a particular policy not tell you something?"
"Does this mean anything to you after the battles in France, after the battles in Spain, after the discontent in Germany, or does it mean nothing?"
"You announce pompously that a European Constitution is being launched."
"Did you notice that two major European demonstrations were held on 4 October in Rome – one organised by the European trades union, the other organised by the anti-globalisation movement – strongly, vehemently criticising this Constitution for the irresolution and ambiguity of its provisions on peace, rights and employment?"
"Then, at the Perugia-Assisi peace march, crowds of people of different cultures, religions and political allegiance called for the structure of the Constitution to be changed radically, with rejection of war made its first provision."
"However, the war continues in Iraq and is polluting the world."
"Guantánamo and the Baghdad detainees have been mentioned today."
"We might also look at the measures restricting freedom in the Arab countries in the face of terrorism and war."
"You have not said how we are to escape from this tragic vicious circle."
"You talk about Europe’s Christian roots, but if these roots exist, the tragedy of the Mediterranean, tantamount to a humanitarian disaster, is unworthy of them."
"How can you fail to see that the quota policy, the immigration policy, has failed?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have spoken in a serious tone about this tragedy in the Chamber."
"It would be indelicate of me to remind you that your government ministers have said that such immigrants should be kicked out and sent back to their own countries."
"Rather, I would draw your attention to the failure of this policy, of the policy of control rather than receiving immigrants and creating a different development model."
"You talk about an economic policy and you seem not to realise that Europe’s economy is actually in crisis and in decline."
"You talk of measures and trans-European networks, yet you heard their quality criticised just now. I ask you, however, above all, how you are planning to deal with an economic crisis in the face of the devaluation of the dollar, relentless competition from the United States of America and competition such as that emerging from China?"
"How do you plan to escape from this vice and how do you plan to stop the decline?"
"You continue to cling to the Maastricht policies, to the policies which the President of the Commission once astutely described as ‘stupid’."
"You can only give any real weight to your policy if you disregard reality."
"Reality will be your downfall."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it appears from the large number of topics that were discussed at the Summit that the Council is well aware of its tasks."
"The Council wants trans-European networks, but, in practice, Member States baulk at building the few kilometres of track that would make it a little easier for their neighbouring countries to export their own freight."
"There is talk of the need to offer development opportunities to people in their own countries, but if sugar or cotton are involved, we always allow the economic interests of a small group, of our own population, to prevail over the opportunities of the many people who live in misery, who try to escape from it and then drown on our beaches."
"For years, we have been talking about the right of the Palestinians to have their own state alongside that of Israel."
"Where, though, is this effective and credible action on the part of the European Union?"
"Once again, one is forced to conclude that such action is required, but where is it?"
"The European Union needs more effective structures in order to act more effectively, without the Member States throwing a spanner in the works."
"This is why we need this constitution."
"We always hoped that Europe would become a house for all, not only for citizens and Member States, but also for those people who live in a region that, for some historical reason, has not become a Member State."
"Why, though, do you not see Europe as a large patchwork of cultures, peoples and regions, where everyone should be offered chances for development?"
"We should take more control of our shared destiny and this should not be thwarted by the prestige politics or short-sightedness of a few Member States."
"We want a European constitution that is truly a new treaty, which gives the European peoples a new and brighter future and which also grants the regions access to the Court of Justice if their rights are violated."
"Mr President-in-Office, the welcomes the Council’s decision to adopt a defence policy, reinforcing a consolidated relationship of cooperation with NATO, and stresses, with regard to the work of the IGC, the need for each Member State to have a Commissioner with voting rights; if Europe is to meet the challenge of wiping out terrorism, it must be capable of protecting every part of its territories and every citizen of its peoples, but also of promoting peace, justice, freedom, democracy and development in countries in which violence and hunger force millions of people to despair and to become refugees."
"The tragedies which have taken place along the coasts of Italy call for the Council to decide to give political refugees the right of asylum, a matter which has been at a standstill for too long, and to clearly condemn governments which do not respect human rights, do not invest in resources to combat hunger and fail to expose terrorist and fundamentalist organisations present on their territory."
"Europe must make clearer efforts to resolve the Somali crisis, which, since 1991, has seen thousands of desperate refugees die, initially in the Indian Ocean, and now in the Sicilian Channel."
"These were not just any immigrants: they were Somalis, Mr President-in-Office!"
"Those whose names were on the lists of terrorist organisations issued after 11 September must not be consultative partners either for the individual states or for the Union."
"The Council, whose decision to create an agency for the common management of borders we welcome, must promote a new cooperation model under which aid serves to benefit the people and those who deny human rights are condemned."
"In addition, the Council must ask for mercy for those whom law has condemned to death, like the young Iranian woman who has been condemned to death for killing a man who was raping her."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, European summits are so high-level, they must take place in the stratosphere, because they appear to be light years away from the daily realities of Europe."
"Mr Prodi, Mr Berlusconi, you are arguing over who should take credit for an initiative for growth, an initiative that is a hoary old chestnut of European politics, which has been trotted out for over twenty years and which will gradually lose all substance."
"As per usual, it looks as though Mr Pasqua will be disappointed."
"Although you have not said a word, I am talking about the Council, about what has stifled growth in Europe and which will prevent any recovery, primarily in the Euro zone: the incredible ‘policy mix’, that incredibly stupid policy which condemns the euro zone to both monetary and budgetary rigour."
"We would have expected the Council to say something about the soaring value of the euro, which is killing our imports, thereby making Europe, the euro zone, the weak link in the world economy."
"Are currency issues only to be discussed at the G8, with all the consequences that that entails?"
"As regards the Constitution, without prejudice to the results, I think that the IGC is causing Europe to indulge in institutional navel-gazing, without the public being able to understand the issues at stake, something that the Convention managed to avoid, whatever one might think about the outcome of its work."
"Well, Mr Berlusconi, you who have managed to be inventive in your own country and revitalise political life by inventing please innovate at European level and come up with a European referendum for us because, whatever the relative influence of our governments, of Parliament and of the Commission on the future architecture of Europe, what is lacking, what could be called the missing link, are the citizens: the only way of involving them in this process of building Europe is to hold a referendum, even if some risk is involved."
"I hope that the IGC will result in a more solid resolution on this matter than did the Convention."
"Mr President, Mr Berlusconi’s statement on the tragic humanitarian situation in Lampedusa is, thank goodness, corroborated by fact."
"I have called upon President Cox to send a European Parliament mission to Lampedusa."
"Europe can come to Lampedusa and other places to see, for instance, the work carried out by Italian policemen, and coastguards, whom I have seen in their patrol boats sharing their ration of food and water and often giving it all to these poor wretches at sea, conveyed by foul traffickers to our borders."
"As well as taking humanitarian measures, however, the States and the European Union have a duty to send a firm, clear, severe warning to the politicians of the immigrants’ countries of provenance, who bear the heavy moral responsibility for not combating this trafficking of human flesh, as it is the duty of all civilised countries to do."
"Yesterday, the High Representative of one of these African countries was our honoured guest, and we even applauded him. He is the leader of one of the countries which has yet to ratify, has yet to conclude the readmission agreements which are so necessary and which are the real guarantee of a policy genuinely combating trafficking of illegal immigrants."
"We warmly welcome the decision taken by the European Union to include biometric indicators, which are essential for identification, in visas, residence permits and passports."
"Like you, therefore, we hope that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will adhere as far as is possible to the deadline of 2003 for reaching agreement on the Council’s proposals on this very badly needed measure."
"The activities of previous Italian left-wing governments have, I am afraid, been characterised by huge-scale, foul theft from the people of Africa."
"I would reassure Mr Barón Crespo that we will ensure that this kind of racism, which is so harmful and so deeply offensive to those peoples, ceases."
"We will exercise the greatest transparency in giving aid to the developing world. That aid must never again be used – as, I am sad to say, has happened in the past, and we should be ashamed of it – for business or, even worse, as illegal funding for political parties in Italy or other countries, maybe, in Europe."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there are two issues on which I would like to comment briefly."
"I believe that the Italian Presidency has so far done extraordinarily good work on the constitutional issue, and I would encourage it to carry the heart of the Convention into the final round of negotiations."
"At the same time, we should not forget that such concepts as transparency, democracy and efficiency are not simply fine words; they also signify something tangible."
"That is why the attempt must be made, as regards transparency and the Legislative Council, which the governments see as an irrelevance, but which is for us a significant issue, since the Council is our partner in the legislative process – to get this Legislative Council to really work in a way that brings things into the open and thus to ensure public control."
"Whatever the difficulties involved, an open-ended form of words needs to be found for this so as not to exclude the possibility of future developments in this direction."
"The efficiency issue is in fact about the Commission, and it would do no damage if it were possible to leave untouched the Convention’s system as it stands today, with the possible addition of voting rights for all."
"Whilst I fully understand the Polish and Spanish positions, I would ask you, in the Council, to leave decision-making in the Council just as the Convention has proposed it, but to find some appropriate way of compensating these states, so that sacrifices are not made only on one side."
"Here too we must not lose sight of the need for efficiency."
"Criticism of Nice in this House focused on the decision-making methods in the Council, and that is something that we should not forget."
"Let me make a final comment on the Convention. The United States of America has recently made it clear that they have problems with a European security and defence policy."
"I think that the Convention has been very clear in its formulation to the effect that structural cooperation is open to all and is not intended to adversely affect membership of NATO."
"This can, if need be, be enhanced, but if there is no structural cooperation in this area, if there is no advance guard to provide a solution to this, then, at some point, a defence union will be established on the continent of Europe, extraneous to the European Union and quite apart from our ties to NATO."
"Let the Americans, the British and others bear in mind that the alternative would be far worse in terms of their interests, and that they should therefore support the Convention’s approach to this."
"We now have to talk not only about the constitution, but also about Europe’s borders."
"I do not think that has so far been adequately discussed."
"We have to clarify the point that an eastward-looking also means that we have to create a second option alongside full membership."
"Only if we are able to set limits – which means, in terms of enlargement, that we should, by not enlarging the EU too far, prevent it from being overstretched – will we be able to advance the development of the EU as it is at present."
"It is for that reason that the second option, in a multilateral form and alongside full Member State status, must be made available to those countries that are not going to join us in the next ten years, whether through lack of desire or capacity to do; this would be something along the lines of a ‘European Economic Area’."
"I would ask you to show some real initiative in this area over the coming months."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, summits come and go and one is very much like the next."
"The meetings of Heads of State or Government produce conclusions whose practical content is generally inversely proportional to their length."
"The conclusions of the European Council are increasingly reminiscent of the pompous resolutions of the now fortunately defunct Supreme Soviet."
"Three years ago, however, Europe did take a great leap forwards, in the shape of Lisbon, but the fine ambitions set there have evaporated, even though we still intone the mantra that Europe must become the most competitive knowledge-based society, blah blah blah."
"The fact is that the Union does not provide itself with resources that match its ambitions."
"How can we make our fellow citizens understand that we are in the process of building Europe with a Community budget that stands at around one measly per cent of gross domestic product?"
"The federal budget of the United States redistributes more than 30% of its national GDP."
"Even the Swiss, who have the reputation of being relatively stingy, redistribute 15% of their GDP through the Confederal budget."
"The budgets of the Member States cannot make up for an inadequate Community budget."
"After three years of mild recession, almost all the States need to address the problem of dwindling resources."
"They are faced with either getting into further debt or having to reduce expenditure on investment, sometimes both at once."
"Public investments have fallen in the European Union to around one measly percentage point of GDP."
"The United States manage 3%."
"According to the Commission’s own staff, 1% of investment brings with it growth of 0.6%."
"The Union’s Member States will not get back on track to achieve healthy growth by now limiting their spending on investment and by cutting European citizens’ purchasing power."
"Mr Berlusconi has just referred to the need to stimulate growth and competitiveness in Europe."
"In this context, we have just rediscovered trans-European networks, but where is the money to fund them?"
"Mr Berlusconi has spoken vaguely about cofinancing under the Community budget."
"Mr Prodi spoke about a lever effect, thanks to the Union budget paying for 30% of cross-border transport costs."
"The Commission document on the European growth initiative only refers, however, to redeploying existing appropriations and does not mention a single extra euro."
"Since it is impossible to spend the same appropriations twice, using appropriations from the structural funds or even those from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development to finance the TENs will not bring any additional growth."
"This is a tragic waste."
"Europe is neglecting future spending, which means spending on education, research and infrastructure."
"The Brussels summit concluded with nothing more to show than pious wishes."
"We are now told that concrete decisions will be taken on 12 and 13 December."
"My group, Mr President, will judge the Italian Presidency on these concrete decisions."
"In order to assist the presidency, we suggest that it take a fresh look at the ideas of Jacques Delors."
"Why not fund the TENs through a major European loan?"
"The European Union’s debt capacity remains intact."
"The euro zone has become an internal market in which nearly 90% of trade is conducted between partner countries."
"Why not be bold enough to launch a policy to stimulate growth that would not work in each country in isolation but which could achieve real results if implemented across Europe?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your report, you described a make-believe Europe which, if it were real, we would want too."
"However, we can see that you are preparing for the adoption of a Constitution which will silence, weaken and condition Europe’s institutions."
"Moreover, you are increasingly bending Europe’s will to US and Soviet ."
"On this occasion, at least, we would like you to set aside personal ambition for once in favour of the collective interest."
"Give up the pleasure of, at all costs, signing your name at the bottom of the draft European Constitution which blocks the possibility of future amendment, gives the Commission a degrading role and provides for paralysing unanimous decision-making in the Council."
"We would also like you, at least for as long as you are President-in-Office of the European Council, to refrain from underselling Europe’s role in upholding human rights, even when they are attacked by the Americans at Guantánamo or the Russians in Chechnya, for the sake of a weekend at Camp David with President Bush or a trip to Sardinia with President Putin."
"Speak out on these issues if you have the courage, providing, of course, that you do not find you have a conflict of interests in those areas."
"Mr Berlusconi, four months have passed since the Thessaloniki Conference entrusted you with the draft Constitution, but, after four months, there is still no indication that there might be practical ways of overcoming the well-known differences on essential points, either as regards voting in the Council – whether it should be unanimous or not – or with regard to the composition of the Commission, or, still less, in relation to economic and social policy or foreign and defence policy, under which the European military forces would supplement NATO’s forces and, therefore, be subordinate to the United States rather than independent."
"The Italian Presidency has been idle and, at all events, has proved incapable of achieving tangible results."
"Its predominant silence regarding the tragic developments in international affairs, starting with the situation in the Middle East, is shameful."
"There will be no peace, there will be no end to the terrorism that we all condemn for as long as Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territories, for as long as the shameful dividing wall remains."
"The UN is paralysed by US vetoes."
"The Italian Presidency must take action. Sermonising serves no purpose."
"It is Europe’s duty to act with great determination, formally recognising the existence of the State of Palestine and promoting the presence of a peacekeeping force that can guarantee respect for the borders of the two States and the implementation of the peace agreements."
"As regards Iraq, we must demand the immediate withdrawal of the occupying troops."
"– Mr President—in-Office of the Council, it is said that the Union will be based on principles of modern democracy but, nevertheless, it is the governments of the States – in other words the European Council – who will decide on the content of the Constitutional Treaty."
"Furthermore, this will be carried out by finding fault with the Convention, which was the nearest thing to a constitutive assembly and which in every way better represented the citizens."
"According to democratic principles, sovereignty resides with the people and not with executive governments."
"The antidemocratic nature of this Union does not stop there, however."
"However much it is proposed to increase the legislative competences of the European Parliament, it will still be the governments of the States in the Councils who will give the go-ahead to European laws and regulations which will then be obligatory for everybody."
"I would therefore ask that there not be a legislative Council of Ministers but rather a second European territorial Chamber, whose members will be appointed by the parliaments of the States and by legislative constitutional bodies."
"That would really be a democratic Europe."
"Furthermore, it seems to me incoherent to propose changing the current reference to peoples in Article 1 of the Treaty for a reference to citizens when the constitutions of the States enshrine their respective peoples and when Articles 5 and 8 call for respect for the identity of the Member States."
"– Mr President, most of the statements which have been made here are dominated by the undisputed political importance of the work of the current Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)."
"Among other things, however, it is also worth reiterating the references to the recovery of the European economy, which, benefiting from the tail end of an improvement in the world economic climate, has managed to implement a raft of key proposals falling under the European Growth Initiative, with the support of the European Investment Bank and the involvement of the private sector, as has already been mentioned here."
"The emphasis given to the problem of managing the Union’s common frontiers also deserves attention, with a view to enhancing the safety of its citizens."
"This is indeed fundamental to defining policies for controlling migratory flows, and illegal immigration in particular."
"By combating unauthorised immigration, one also combats the networks through which the traffic in human beings passes, as well as all the associated criminal activity. At the same time, as you said, Mr President, one generates conditions under which legal immigrants can be generously welcomed and appropriately integrated into society in our countries."
"The work of the IGC, however, dominates the agenda, and we therefore feel that this is a good opportunity to call to mind the huge political responsibility incumbent on the Italian Presidency and the governmental representatives who are currently working towards an agreement on revising the Treaties."
"Without wanting to belittle the value of the work produced by the Convention – in which I had a hand, in any case – the fact is that the revision of the Treaties began, properly speaking, when the Intergovernmental Conference opened."
"With these words in our minds and on our lips, we nevertheless respect the Treaties currently in force."
"That is why the Thessaloniki Council treated the Convention as a good basis for discussion and not as a awaiting only the ministerial seal of approval."
"In this connection, and by way of conclusion, what is expected of the IGC is that, on finishing its work, it should present the national parliaments and the citizens of the Member States with a revised treaty, one whose basic clauses maintain the principle of institutional balance which has from the beginning permitted the interests and equality of the Member States to remain compatible with the requirements of European integration."
"Mr President, Mr Berlusconi emphasised, a short while ago, and I quote, ‘the historic importance of the constitutional step we are in the process of taking’."
"And yet, the initial meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference give the impression that they are skirting around the subject."
"They are discussing with great authority and wisdom issues of institutional arrangements, which are indeed complex but ultimately of lesser importance, whilst nothing has yet been said on the most crucial issue, the principle itself of a constitution for a supreme body, which closely resembles a super State, with its supranational decision-making procedures and the absolute primacy of European law."
"The Heads of State or Government are consequently sidestepping the main issue, which is: why should we have a constitution?"
"Is it simply an operation designed to clarify the Treaties? Or is it instead an almost final stage of building the European super-State?"
"Will this super-State meet the needs of an enlarged Europe?"
"Would variable geometry not be a more appropriate solution?"
"All of these crucial issues, which are hidden from public view, must be addressed one day, we hope at least in referendums on ratifying the constitution."
"The further off that day is, however, Mr President, the harsher the awakening will be."
"Mr President, we British Conservatives note Mr Berlusconi's words on the need to re-launch the European economy."
"President-in-Office, you mention competitiveness, economic growth and deregulation."
"They are all welcome words but they are also well-worn words from past Council statements."
"The question is whether on this occasion these words will turn into action."
"Sadly, it seems again that Europe is more interested in rhetoric than the real reform that is needed to kick-start the Lisbon process."
"The need for real and far-reaching structural economic reform is pressing."
"What evidence is there of concrete actions from Member States to implement such reform?"
"The president has spoken of his commitment to implementation of the financial services action plan, but the reality is that progress on the investment services directive has been frustrated just recently by Member States under this presidency."
"Low growth and unemployment remain critical issues for Europe: matters that can only be addressed fully by the application of a determined political will to act over the structural weakness of the European economy."
"But Europe is yet again more comfortable in pressing ahead with constitutional and institutional reform rather than taking practical action which makes a real difference to the day-to-day lives of our constituents."
"There surely was a message for all of us in the Swedish referendum vote."
"Has it been heeded?"
"The message from Sweden instead appears to have led some Member States to a renewed determination that voters should not be allowed the chance to express their views on the great European issues."
"Of course in Spain, in Portugal, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland, the electorate will have their say on the constitution in a referendum and I was pleased to note that the Prime Minister of France, Mr Raffarin, has said that it is necessary for a referendum to be held there."
"That is why we were all a bit confused last week by the attitude of the British Government on the issue of a UK referendum."
"Indeed, the government seems to be in complete disarray on the subject: senior civil servants briefing in the UK denying a referendum was untenable; a junior foreign office minister keeping the door open before it was firmly shut by Mr Blair."
"Eighty per cent of British people want a say in a referendum on this Constitution."
"Yesterday, my party in the UK launched a petition to our parliament demanding it."
"The fundamental changes in the relationship between the Union and the citizens of Europe proposed in the draft Treaty will not have legitimacy without the consent of the people."
"There is just one other issue that I think has been causing real concern in the UK in recent days: the future of European defence and the Transatlantic Alliance."
"Our American allies have expressed genuine concerns about the draft Treaty's proposals on defence."
"The US Ambassador to NATO has said recently that they constitute the most significant threat to NATO's future."
"The British Prime Minister says the opposite, that he would do nothing to undermine NATO, but this is of course the Prime Minister who assured Britain that the Constitution was nothing more than a 'tidying up exercise'."
"France and Belgium continue to want a separate military structure to be created with a new headquarters in Brussels."
"We see this as a challenge to NATO's supremacy in European defence."
"I want to make it clear, to put our position on the record clearly and unambiguously."
"We believe in NATO as the bedrock of European defence and any initiative that seeks to create a parallel structure within the EU framework undermines that long-standing and proven alliance."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking both for myself and on behalf of our group, let me warmly welcome and emphatically endorse what the President-in-Office of the Council has said about the defence of the European Union’s external borders, and his observations on the recent and lamentable loss of human life off the coast of Sicily."
"I gained the impression that Mr Berlusconi was very sincere in what he said, and share his bewilderment."
"I can also tell him that the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House takes the view that the defence of the external borders and of refugees’ human dignity is not a task for Italy, Spain, or Greece, but for Europe, and we Europeans, from whatever country, must be clear in our minds that Italy is also defending the borders of my own country and those of Ireland."
"Italy thus has a responsibility to Europe, and we have an obligation of solidarity with Mr Berlusconi’s country."
"If it is the case that we have this obligation of solidarity, and if this is a matter of our common European concern, then we can also manifestly rejoice that, within the Council Presidency, this task is in the hands of the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers, Mr Pisanu, whose exemplary approach we very much welcome."
"We rejoice that it is not in the hands of certain members of your government, who say that, when they see boats full of such refugees, they want to hear the cannons thunder."
"We prefer the acting chairman of the Council of Interior Ministers."
"Mr Berlusconi, you have again had little to say about the Council’s conclusions on the outcomes of the discussions on judicial and police cooperation."
"You kept to yourself your thoughts on the statement in Article 34 of the Conclusions that discussion was needed on specific operations to combat serious crime in Europe and on the need for cooperation in this area."
"When I last spoke, I put two questions to you; I would like to put them again today, and I ask you to give me an answer, as our group regards what you will say in response as a matter of urgent concern."
"So let me ask you, Mr President of the Council, what you contemplate doing about speeding up the introduction of a European public prosecution service."
"What, in particular, are you thinking of doing about the introduction of the European arrest warrant?"
"Our intention in introducing a common arrest warrant was to combat the most serious criminal activity in Europe, and I am not repeating this question just for dramatic effect; rather, I want to remind this House that, just in case the European arrest warrant does not enter into force on 1 January, the European Convention on the mutual rendition of offenders expires on 31 December this year, so that the law will be in a weaker position in 2004."
"As there is danger ahead, we want you to tell us what you are doing about speeding up the introduction of the European arrest warrant."
"What gives my question ever more urgency is the appearance in today’s edition of , a newspaper with which you, Mr Berlusconi, may be acquainted, of an article by Mrs Sabrina Cottone from Milan, who interviewed Mr Bossi, in the course of which interview he said, ‘if the European arrest warrant is adopted, it will be a step towards dictatorship, towards terror’."
"Mr Bossi went on to say that the European arrest warrant is a crime in itself’."
"I will repeat that quotation: ‘The European arrest warrant is a crime in itself."
"It would be crazy to adopt it, and if it is adopted, then I will be its first victim’."
"Well, opinions may differ about that."
"What I would like to know is whether making the law less effective in the fight against organised crime is one of the EU’s objectives. Ought it not rather, Mr Berlusconi, to be your task, firstly, to put Mr Bossi in his place, and secondly, to do everything possible to enable the arrest warrant to become effective on 1 January 2004?"
"I would be obliged to you if you could answer this question."
"– I barely have the courage to say this, but we agreed in 2000 to be the world's most competitive, knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"After so many debates and so little progress, it seems to have turned into a bad joke."
"This report by the Council demonstrates once again that we need to cut back on the administrative burden for industry."
"Nobody will have a problem agreeing with this on paper, but do we really realise what this involves in practice?"
"In the Netherlands, the Finance Minister, Gerrit Jan Zalm, set up a website entitled, , which enables businesses to specify on there exactly what is hindering them in their business activities."
"I call on you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to do the same in the European Union."
"We must give victims the chance to speak out."
"Only if we have a serious overview of administrative burdens, can we set to work."
"Hence, www.stopeuropeanoverregulation.eu!"
"I should like to finish off by saying, Mr President, that from your previous visit to this Parliament, I gather that you like a joke, and I therefore assume that your promises to the Ukraine about EU membership are an expression of your original sense of humour."
"Surely we should first make a success of the current enlargement, and only then can we think about making new promises."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst there are those who assert that Europe’s governments are steadily dismembering the compromise that the Convention laboriously put together on the constitution, others maintain the legitimacy of their modifying the Convention’s draft."
"For those who were there at Amsterdam and Nice, the Brussels summit is all about ."
"There is, in any case, no denying the fact that representatives of the national parliaments had a hand in the consensus that the Convent painstakingly hammered out."
"The signals sent out from Brussels put me in a thoughtful frame of mind."
"Europe’s governments may well not have made any headway, but they affirm that they are heading in the right direction."
"The German Federal Chancellor, Mr Schröder, allows the French President Chirac to represent him."
"In Europe, we know that nothing can be done without Paris and Berlin, but was it really necessary to put on such a show of strength to deliver a rebuff to all those who warn of a Franco-German directorate?"
"Finally, there is the growth initiative, with a lot of paper and no action ever since the Essen resolution – as long ago, let me emphasise, as 1994."
"What this means is that a Quick Start programme is to be put together in time for the December summit, listing the TEN projects that are to be completed."
"It leaves open the question as to how much money the EU will be chipping in towards the TEN projects, as too, though, is the question of whether the Stability Pact supplants the Growth Pact or vice versa."
"I would have thought that growth is impossible without stability, for, at the end of the day, today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I want, in this speech, to focus in the main on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, which forms, indeed, the centrepiece of the Italian Presidency of the Council, and which we want to encourage the Italian Presidency to complete before the end of this year, that being the only way of ensuring that Europe will continue, post-enlargement, to be capable of taking action, transparent and acceptable to its citizens."
"This is a big task for the Heads of State or Government to take upon themselves in Europe’s interests."
"So I also want to ask you – and here I am appealing to the Council and to the Heads of State or Government as a whole – to be really aware of the European point of view and of their responsibility to Europe in the negotiations, and not to get tangled up in trivial national issues."
"We saw at the last Intergovernmental Conference, in Nice, where that can lead, and that is not the European spirit that we desperately need."
"People have high expectations, and the Council bears great responsibilities."
"In its fashion, the Convention produced an astonishing good result."
"I would like to state that it makes an outstanding basis for the deliberations that are now to take place at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would like to point out, though, that a few critical comments do of course have to be made alongside all the positive aspects."
"Firstly, I think it right and proper that we should find a place in the preamble of this Treaty for the Christian heritage that has shaped this continent like nothing else, the clasp that holds it together."
"Let Mr Cohn-Bendit make as much noise as he likes about that, but his roots, too, are in this continent’s Christian heritage."
"Your reacting in the way that you do proves me right."
"Secondly, we will have to give some thought to whether the Convention, in part 3, has overshot the mark here in transferring certain tasks to the European level that have not been there before and should not be there now."
"I would give services of general interest as being one example."
"If we have a proper understanding of subsidiarity, the European level has no business dealing with services of general interest, nor with the coordination of social and economic policy."
"I do not know what added value there is for Europe in this area, where a bit more subsidiarity and competition among the Member States is more likely to be of benefit to the internal market in terms of the Lisbon objectives being achieved."
"The same is true of the rules on access to the national labour markets."
"These are issues on which decisions are the Member States’ responsibility, and questions to which the public expect answers from the Member States rather than from the European level."
"If we succeed in resolving these problems as well, we will end up with a Treaty that really does deserve to be supported by people throughout Europe."
"The most honourable thing that the Council can do is to assume responsibility as representatives of the people of Europe."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is only right that the Convention’s draft should come to the conclusion that we have too little Europe rather than too much."
"That is why we need coordination not only of economic and financial policy, but also of social and employment policy as well."
"I believe that the initiative for growth and investment, which we are discussing, makes clear how feeble are our conceptions of how growth and employment are to be organised."
"That is why I would like to call on the Council and its President to speak in far more definite terms about the approaches we want to take."
"It is, I think, a good thing that we are going back to the infrastructure modernisation measures and thinking about energy and the environment rather than just transport."
"I think it right that we should give some thought to research and development, but we must, above all, get a skills offensive started in all Member States simultaneously, as we will not be able to increase growth without skilled people, nor will we be able to become a knowledge-based society in which everyone is able to participate."
"That is why everything possible has to be done to give us functioning social services, which should, in particular, help to reconcile work and family life, for women are indispensable if we are to achieve the higher employment rate that we need."
"Sweden, Denmark and Finland have shown the ways in which we can do this."
"The European Union has no lack of sources of funds, and I am not thinking only of the EIB or of the other options available."
"I cannot but consider the way in which, in this European Union, payment of VAT is evaded to the tune of an estimated EUR 100 billion a year, quite apart from other taxes."
"That would be more than these EUR 220 billion for ten years, and would enable us to get something really up and running."
"That is why it really is time for us not to do as your own country does and put our faith in tax amnesties, but to at last get round to coordinating mutual assistance by tax authorities as a means of dealing with the scandalous cross-border criminal activity involving fraudulent invoicing, the motor and mobile phone trades, and the use of VAT evasion as a means of funding other underhand activities; all of these things we must put the brakes on, halt them and put an end to them once and for all."
"Mr President, one cannot be truly surprised at the slow progress of the opening of this IGC phase."
"One must simply trust that, as the prime ministers have had more time to reflect upon the outcome of the Convention and upon the poorer quality of their own proposals, they will be drawn closer to accepting the outcome of the Convention and selling it on to their publics."
"One issue that concerns me especially is the absence of a clear schedule for consideration of Part III."
"The IGC is surely a wonderful chance for us to refresh and modernise the policy chapters, some of which, like the CAP, are 50 years old."
"If Part III cannot be properly reformed, the IGC must, at least in Part IV, seek to soften the future revision procedures for Part III."
"Mr President, at the Brussels European Council, Europe’s leaders quite clearly gave up on the idea of setting immigration quotas according to nationality."
"This decision followed on from the statements by Mr Fini, favouring the right of foreigners to vote in Italy and those by Mr Prodi, seeking to pursue his commitment to integration by obtaining new civil and political rights, proves the complicity and the active participation of Europe’s current leaders in the process of opening up our borders to legal immigration and consequently to the eventual mass colonisation of Europe."
"The consequences of these irresponsible policies will inevitably lead to the loss of our national identities, to the ethnic communitarisation of European societies and to the loss of national unity, which guarantees civil peace."
"We do know, however, most fortunately, that this colonisation of Europe will not take place without the citizens reacting to it in a legitimate, sound and healthy way."
"– Mr President, the truth is that the Italian Presidency has not had an easy agenda."
"I am going to refer to three points."
"Firstly, the difficult birth of the Constitution."
"We are impatiently awaiting the proposals which the Presidency—in-Office is going to make in order to try to overcome the outstanding issues in the second half of November and we are glad that we have been told that these proposals will deal with the problem from a global perspective."
"By global, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, I mean a solution which can affect all the institutions, which can achieve the agreement of all the institutions, and also of all the Member States – some of which have announced that they are going to hold a referendum – and of all the new States – which have also held referendums within another context."
"I believe, Mr President, that this is an aspect of the problem which should not be avoided."
"The second difficulty faced by the Italian Presidency is how to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation."
"Mr President of the Commission, growth, yes, but also stability."
"We are happy with the Commission's proposed growth initiative, according to which infrastructures must play a fundamental role, because it is usually said, Mr President, that when the Europe of infrastructures, the Europe of construction, goes well, the construction of Europe goes well."
"There is a simple reason for this: the integration of the markets is not just a political or judicial notion but, above all and fundamentally, a physical notion."
"Hence the fundamental importance of infrastructures, which – being inert systems – make accumulated delays irrecoverable."
"Either Europe resolves the problem of infrastructures once and for all or it will have to abandon forever its aspirations to become the most competitive area by 2010."
"The final difficulty I wanted to refer to in this speech is that of how to restore relations with the United States following the Iraq crisis and following the events of 11 September."
"I believe, Mr President, that we must place the emphasis on the fundamental rather than on the peripheral."
"The fundamental thing is a shared history, common values which clash – as our President, Mr Poettering, and others have reminded us – on issues such as Guantánamo and the death penalty, and also our shared passion for freedom."
"We now have a wonderful opportunity to express the united view of our European Union project at the coming Conference of Donors because – as I had the opportunity to say yesterday in the debate on the budget – the rehabilitation, reconstruction, pacification and democratisation of Iraq is not a responsibility which should fall exclusively to the United States, but to the international democratic community."
"Mr President, I said at the beginning of my speech that the Italian Presidency did not have an easy agenda."
"It is clear, however, Mr President—in-Office of the Council, that without difficult goals no summit is worth climbing."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would like to wish the Italian Presidency luck and success in the decisive months remaining to it."
"– Mr President, I would firstly like to say that Catalonia, where I come from, together with Aragon, Roussillon and the neighbouring areas, are still suffering from the lack of will or ill-will demonstrated by the Spanish and French Governments and other authorities responsible for developing infrastructures which would allow the Pyrenean border to be eliminated."
"It is an example – a further example – of stupidity and short-sightedness, since an even more dynamic and powerful European region in that area would benefit everybody."
"I hope that President Prodi's announcement of an increase of 30% in the funding of cross-border sections of the European networks will help governments to act in accordance with the conclusions of the Council which they themselves sign."
"The development of a free Europe without borders is one side of the coin; on the other side are the management of external borders and movement of people."
"In this regard also there is identical stinginess and lack of ambition."
"I am pleased that the Council is reiterating the global view of the phenomenon of migration adopted at the Thessaloniki European Council; that is important, but admission, residence, integration, border control and the creation of positive dynamics with regard to immigration for receiving countries and countries of origin were dealt with at the Tampere European Council."
"A legislative programme and coherent and clear political action which make it more attractive to go to a consulate than to put out to sea have been on the table for years, just as we have a European programme for offering justice and security to European citizens on the basis of cooperation between Member States, the cornerstone of which is the European arrest warrant."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you talk about in the Councils?"
"How can you make generalised statements about fighting crime when what we are waiting for is for you to tell us how and when you are going to adopt the proposals we have on the table, and whether they are going to take effect by the expected date in all the Member States?"
"President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, President of the Commission, it has been said that this summit too was full of so-called decisions."
"I wonder what the people of Europe think of an organisation that, summit after summit, continues to take decisions with which the Heads of Government do not even get their own ministers to comply."
"Is there any proportion between costs and outcome?"
"President Berlusconi, you had an opportunity to put a stop to these meaningless resolutions from the summits, and I regret that you did not take it."
"I also wish to emphasise that I have criticised previous presidencies on the same account."
"I believe it is important for the summits to be fundamentally reformed so that people regain their confidence in the EU and its institutions."
"President Berlusconi, you emphasised Christian values in your speech."
"One of the Christian values I believe that everyone, irrespective of their denomination, should profess is that of alleviating suffering as much as possible."
"I am therefore concerned about the many ongoing attempts to halt new research in genetic engineering in which all types of stem cells are made use of."
"To promote that research is to reduce suffering."
"– Mr President, I would like to address two messages to the President—in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission."
"The first is that we cannot and must not end this debate without a serious and rigorous political commitment, in order to put an end once and for all to the deaths, exploitation and trafficking in human beings, in other words, to the terrible human tragedies which we see daily on the southern Mediterranean border."
"Commitments rather than words."
"To the wave of 528 immigrants who a few days ago landed on the Andalusian coasts and in the Canary Islands, we must also add the approximately 70 who, it appears, have died trying to reach the coasts of Sicily."
"It is very possible, moreover, that today or tomorrow we will continue to add to this doleful list."
"The second message is that the European Union, as such, cannot deal with common immigration and asylum policies unless the agreements which the Member States adopt, either in interesting meetings such as the one that took place in La Baule, which may lead to the beginning of strengthened cooperation in this field, or in the meetings of the Council of Ministers, are not then reflected in cooperative policies which lead to the burdens and responsibilities being shared, both from an economic point of view, and in terms of human and material resources."
"I believe, therefore, that we need also to provide, for example, for the need to create a European fund for the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"There are some countries, such as my own, Spain, which face high costs in cases of repatriation."
"Having said this, it is essential also that countries of origin and transit take a much more responsible attitude, and particularly those countries with whom we have association agreements, which should fulfil all the terms of those agreements and not just the economic ones."
"Equally, within the framework of these agreements, the Commission and the Council should appeal firmly and insistently to countries which, as in the case of Morocco or Tunisia, are the origin of the tragic events I have referred to."
"– Mr President, Mr Berlusconi’s appearances in this House are remarkable in many ways."
"Today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have managed to speak for 19 minutes and 39 seconds, in which time you have had a great deal to say about economic growth, competitiveness, innovation, industrial policy, then back to increased competitiveness and to foreign policy."
"All of these are things we can agree with."
"Yet you did not manage, in these 19 minutes and 39 seconds, to say one word, not even one syllable, on the subject of environmental policy or sustainability."
"We can be grateful to Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, for evidently thinking in what are evidently less simplistic ways and for having, moreover, a good memory, as he did indeed say that the European Union’s policies must always be guided by the principle of sustainability, and he reminded us all of the Lisbon process, of which I am sure that you too have some recollection."
"What the Lisbon process means is that the European Union’s policies must, of course, enable it to compete, whilst always taking account of considerations of the environment and of sustainability."
"You have managed to insert into the Council Conclusions a statement on industrial policy to the effect that the consequences of all proposed EU legislation on enterprises are to be taken into account by providing a comprehensive impact assessment, and have, by way of providing a good example, immediately proposed starting with chemicals policy, which you, surprisingly, want to have dealt with in the Competition Council rather than in the Environment Council."
"This was a great surprise – certainly one of last week’s surprising moments – not only for me, but also many of your fellow-members of the Council."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Berlusconi, whether you are aware that environmental policy is not just something that we do because we are good or perhaps because we want to try and do things in an ecological way; but rather that we do it because it makes our industry competitive and because it enables us to pass on our planet and our immediate environment to our children, and perhaps because it enables us to maintain the good living conditions that we enjoy."
"When you last appeared before this House, I asked you whether you intended to apply your strength and somewhat more energy to advancing the European Union’s environmental measures."
"To that question you would not give an answer."
"I hope that you will now give me an answer setting out your position on your policies’ ecological aspects and how you personally would assess your resources and the progress you have made so far, precisely what you conceive of as success in ecological terms, and whether you have to date achieved any sort of success in the area of environmental policy."
"Mr President, it is always difficult, in two minutes, to sum up or evaluate a Council with a full agenda like the last one which took place in Brussels."
"I am going to comment on the economic context, also with reference to many of this morning’s interventions."
"It is a fact that there is something wrong in our analyses, something that is wrong somewhere."
"We have come out of a global World Trade Organisation summit which has not provided the expected results at all, and the word ‘failure’ is a realistic way to describe it; we have a multilateral approach to trade policies which are currently in deep crisis; we must begin once more to ascertain whether the Doha requirements still do not have a basis, or whether the evolution of Doha will lead us to assume other positions."
"At the same time, we have a situation in Europe where inflation levels are essentially under control; the energy prices are, I would say, fairly stable and financial market conditions are not negative."
"So the question is: why is there no recovery?"
"And economic recovery depends on series of factors which can only come into play in a European context."
"It is true that we are reinterpreting a Keynesian model readjusted to present times, but in this Keynesian model we need to speed up structural reforms."
"When we talk of structural reforms, we also have the political burden and task of leaving behind privileges of position which at this time are becoming onerous with respect to economic developments."
"The Brussels proposals are tangible and interesting."
"We have learned that politics is a job which must produce daily results, and that it is built on the basis of daily efforts and daily work."
"On 12 and 13 December, I think that we will see much of what was considered at last week’s Council become concrete proposals."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you, Mr President of the Commission, spoke of ‘turning words into action’. Indeed – the implementation of what has been resolved upon rather than announcements, and a move from enlargement to integration."
"Not only for the media, but also for many of us in this House, the summit was more about rhetoric than about substance."
"I cannot deny that I attribute that to the date on which it was held."
"Fourteen days after the gathering in Rome, what really new developments can one expect on the constitutional front?"
"What sort of response did the Commission expect to its Growth Initiative in view of its inadequate preparation and the fact that the EU has no policy on either industry or the economy?"
"Might it not be necessary to combine the Member States’ economic programmes and the Growth Initiative into a package with real financial capacity and to make a statement about who is to do what by when in Europe in order to achieve the objectives that we agreed together?"
"I spoke in terms of announcements giving way to the implementation of what has been resolved upon."
"We do not need anything new."
"We want Europe to be strong on the world stage and, internally, to be structured on subsidiary lines."
"We want the Stability and Growth Pact; let us abide by it and implement it."
"We have the concept of the internal market; let us at last make it a reality."
"We have competition policy; let us see to it that barriers to competition are removed in every Member State."
"We have the targets set at Lisbon, Göteborg, and Barcelona; what we need is operational programmes to implement what has been resolved upon, not new announcements."
"Secondly, we have before us a balanced basis for decision on the constitution."
"We all know what points remain to be resolved."
"While services of general interest are subject to the subsidiarity principle, they form part of the European social model, and so they need a derogation from competition law."
"Delays will do nothing to resolve these issues."
"We can achieve the timetable because the issues are still on the table."
"Thirdly we say both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to a referendum."
"By that we mean a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to a national referendum on reform. I will conclude by putting a question to you."
"Why, then, do we not start by rethinking this issue too? I say ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide referendum, ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide information campaign, ‘yes’ to a Europe-wide result."
"That means that the majority of the states and the majority of the votes decide instead of nationalising a European project."
"– Mr President, the report by the Council starts with a short paragraph on the Constitutional Treaty."
"There is evidently little progress to report on that score."
"What we hear is in any case not so positive in a few respects."
"It appears difficult to enlarge first and only then to focus on depth."
"We had anticipated this all along."
"The increasing fixation on the ideal of what is termed national sovereignty and national interest sparks proposals that are mainly focused on the question as to how we can frustrate the decision-making process in Europe."
"This is the central idea of most of the attempts to change the outcome of the Convention."
"Some want to maintain veto rights, while others want to reduce the blocking minority and yet others want to structure the Commission in such a way that all objections related to the Council decision-making process return to the Commission."
"This would render the Commission a weakened body of national prejudice."
"Finally, with reference to what Mr Karas stated, we are facing all these national referendums which, together, form a very undemocratic decision-making tool, because one small majority in one country can cause the whole of Europe to grind to a halt."
"If that is democracy, then I do not know."
"All of this is at odds with the intentions of the founders of European integration."
"They succeeded in starting this gigantic innovation because of a broad European vision."
"Had they remained stuck in a mosaic of small-minded, national interests, then Europe would have remained a platform for power games, violent or not, as the case may be."
"We must continue to call a spade a spade."
"A Commissioner who fails to prioritise the European interest but represents his own national interests is a corrupt Commissioner who must be brought down."
"Parliament should not be reduced to a collection of errand boys of Member State governments."
"After all, we are the direct representatives of the European citizens."
"It is unfortunate that in some new Member States, leading personalities do not, for demagogic reasons, distinguish between the roles of Brussels and of Soviet Moscow."
"It is very obvious where the differences lie: participation, free will, and so on."
"We hope that the enlargement, which for a long time was our fondest wish, will considerably reinforce the European idea, for that is its objective."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the new external borders are to be set wider, with consequent migratory pressures, leads me to welcome your setting as a priority the reinforcement of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"I welcome your choice of a multidisciplinary approach to deal with this, taking in the securing of the external borders and accelerated asylum procedures, along with measures to deal with immigration, steering the legal and combating the illegal."
"I would, though, like to make a number of specific comments, starting with one on the management of the external borders."
"If we want to have a whole range of projects to manage the external borders in new ways, with very high standards enforced everywhere, then coordination is needed."
"The Commission and the Council have now proposed the establishment of a new agency, but the question arises of where it is to be located."
"I would not be in favour of our again devolving competences upon an agency over which we have no control; I would instead prefer it if a coordinating unit – which might as well be called an agency – were to be set up within the Commission, where it could function efficiently."
"I would ask you, when evaluating the options, to give consideration to this one."
"My second comment has to do with repatriation policy."
"If you want to put together credible policies on asylum and legal immigration, you have to combat illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum, and so you need a common repatriation policy as well."
"I would encourage you, then, in future, to conclude repatriation agreements not only with states like Macao, but also, in fact, with the states from which we can expect the most migrants."
"That is what we expect, and we will support you in doing this."
"We will also help you to work towards the provision of information at the grass roots in these countries, which is the best way of preventing the trafficking in human beings."
"For my final point, I ask you to exert more pressure on the Member States to get them, at last, to implement the directives on refugee status and asylum procedures, so that we can, once and for all, ensure that decisions are taken and procedures completed speedily, and that refugees get help without delay."
"– Mr President, I would like, very briefly, to say something about the President-in-Office of the Council’s statements on foreign policy and also on the outcome from the Council."
"One could hardly expect the Council to do other than give attention to the situation in the Middle East and lament the way in which this has deteriorated, which it has done, also calling on both sides to renounce violence and enjoining a policy of moderation upon them."
"Today, Mr President of the Council, I would like to call upon you to do everything you possibly can, whether through official or unofficial channels, to give real support to all the peace initiatives, whether they be Palestinian or Israeli in origin."
"Among other things, I am referring here to what are termed the Geneva Accords, a splendid initiative by people who really have been involved for years with the whole complex process."
"Let me make an exception here, and quote from an author – Amos Oz, an Israel writer who has this to say in a commentary on these Geneva Accords: ‘Ever since the Six Day War, we are as close to the Palestinians as a jailer is to the prisoner handcuffed to him."
"A jailer cuffing his wrist to that of a prisoner for an hour or two is a matter of routine."
"A jailer though who cuffs himself to his prisoner for thirty-six long years is himself no longer a free man."
"The occupation has also robbed us of freedom.’"
"These words, I think, clearly express the need for the European Union, too, to contribute something towards putting a stop to this state of non-freedom, which this situation has caused to prevail in Israel itself, and the fact that the Geneva Accords provide us with a good example."
"The last few days, though, have also shown that the conflict in Palestine and the situation in Iraq are even more closely connected than we, in this House, had repeatedly claimed them to be."
"Although, Mr President of the Council, there is at present rejoicing at the unanimous adoption of the United Nations resolution, we must not abandon the objectives that this House has always pursued in relation to Iraq policy: a strong role for the United Nations and a progressive but speedy and clearly-defined transfer of power from the Americans, from the armed forces, to the Iraqis."
"Iraq belongs to the Iraqi people, and it must be made apparent, unambiguously and relatively quickly, that the European Union wants to implement this principle and put it into practice."
"I am not very happy about the way in which the agreement with Iran came about."
"I would have preferred it if it had been reached by Mr Frattini, the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, in tandem with Mr Solana, the High Representative."
"We should, though, be glad that the three European foreign ministers have managed to come to an agreement with Iran."
"Agreements can be reached without war, they can be reached by peaceful means, they can be reached by negotiating with countries that put up resistance, and we should rejoice that this important agreement with Iran now appears to have been concluded."
"Mr President, during the Convention proceedings, the pessimists predicted a negative outcome, at best a delay which would have jeopardised the objective of giving the new Europe its first Constitution in a short space of time."
"Instead, we all know the way things turned out: in the end politics prevailed, the sense of responsibility prevailed and Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, despite the initial criticisms, achieved the objective."
"Today, in this Chamber, I have heard certain pessimists making predictions about the outcome of the IGC which are not positive."
"Naturally, no one believes that the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will not come up against obstacles."
"No one believes that it will all be easy, but I am convinced that in the end, as in the case of the Convention, the European interest will prevail."
"This is why I am optimistic, this is why I am convinced that this Presidency will make Europe take significant steps forward."
"It is impossible not to welcome with satisfaction the statement made by the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, or to welcome with just as much satisfaction certain affirmations made by President Chirac?"
"Politics is mediation, not propaganda; it is the ability to attain the goal within the prearranged time."
"I am convinced that this Presidency, therefore, will attain the objectives which it has set itself: Europe will have, before the next European elections, its first Constitutional Treaty, fruit of the valuable work of the Convention and also fruit of Parliament’s work."
"Parliament’s active participation in the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference is an extremely positive result, and this choice is proof of the fact that the Italian Presidency has maintained its promises made in this Chamber."
"I cannot fail to stress the importance of reference to our Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution."
"It is not, Mr Barón Crespo, a question of a monopoly, but quite the opposite; it is that we must not dismiss the contribution that Christianity has made to the moral and social growth and development of this continent."
"I am referring to the values which Mother Teresa of Calcutta embodied and observed: values which we all, believers and non-believers, share."
"Also when we talk about the major, difficult issue of immigration, Europe cannot fail to hear the cry of pain uttered by millions and millions of Africans."
"Africa, with its tragedies, will constitute the emergency of the coming decades."
"Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, confirm that the approach to this great emergency is the right one."
"Carry on!"
"As many fellow Members asserted today in this Chamber, Europe – the whole of Europe – has to take responsibility, in political and economic terms, for organising and protecting the borders."
"The road embarked upon by the Italian Presidency, I repeat, is the right one."
"This is why we should encourage and support it, just as it should be supported, Mr Bertinotti, in respect of development policy."
"How can we consider increasing the competitiveness of our regions without putting in place major infrastructure in order to develop the internal market and to create new jobs?"
"Carry on with the decisions concerning Lisbon too: without a serious reform of welfare systems our young citizens will not be offered any hope."
"Social-democratic Germany has embarked on this path, as has centre-right France."
"These are not, therefore, choices made by one side or the other, but it is a question of political farsightedness."
"The decision promoting research is also positive: it was a promise made in this Chamber in July, and has been kept; just as the fight against organised crime is a promise."
"I am pleased to see that Mr Schulz reads Italian newspapers attentively."
"Allow me to supplement his press review with some news."
"It is well-known that, with regard to the European Prosecutor, the Italian Government and the current Union Presidency have decided to adhere to the text submitted to the European Union by the Convention."
"With regard to the European arrest warrant, as is just as well known – it is in the Italian press – the draft law to modify Italian regulations in line with the prearranged framework-decision at European level has already been tabled to the Council of Ministers and will be discussed soon, before being submitted to Parliament for adoption by 31 December this year."
"In conclusion, therefore, in my opinion, this House, despite a few deliberately provocative interventions related to political affiliation, is encouraging the Italian Presidency to move forward along the road on which it has embarked."
". Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who made observations."
"We have made careful note of all the speeches; we will take them into account during the 50 working days which we still have before the European Council in mid-December."
"There have been remarks from many quarters regarding the achievements and work of this Presidency."
"I would simply like to point out that it really is difficult – and I personally have experienced this – to address all the issues involved in holding a Presidency, in the very short space of time available; all the more so for those holding the Presidency in the second half of the year, as this space of time is reduced, in practice, to just four months."
"In July and August, we did try to hold meetings with Heads of State or Government, but it was virtually impossible and we confined ourselves to the possibility of bilateral talks."
"Therefore, in terms of actual working time, for a Presidency with this mandate during the second half of the year, four months are left."
"Then there is the Christmas period, with the last European Council being brought forward to 12 and 13 December as a result, and so there truly is very little time available."
"This means that we must look closely at the proposal in the draft Constitutional Treaty which provides for presidencies lasting two and a half years, with the possibility of renewal."
"The hope is that it will be possible to find an influential President, who can represent our Union on the international stage with authority, and who also has the necessary time, maybe, to manage the rotating systems according to which the European Council operates, which of course cannot be done in too short a space of time."
"I would remind you, however, that during this period, the Italian Presidency has endeavoured to discharge its responsibilities."
"Just to try to explain how many things a Presidency has to do, I will tell you what we have done: we have held over 42 meetings with government representatives of Community countries and candidate countries; we have ended several old disputes which no previous Presidency had resolved; we have chaired 26 Ministerial Council meetings, along with all the work also required from the President-in-Office personally in preparing for these European Councils in the various sectors and in coordinating the Councils themselves; we have adopted 17 regulations and directives; we have concluded three conciliation procedures with the European Parliament, which had been ongoing for some time; we have concluded or signed seven international agreements; we have begun the technical review of the texts adopted by the Convention – all of this involves numerous sittings, and almost always at night, what is more, for the President-in-Office; we have held eight Association and Cooperation Councils, including Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, Tunisia and so on; we have had 10 summits and troikas, and moreover, this very week I am going to China; we have held 30 COREPER meetings, along with all the preparatory meetings; we have had 15 working meetings with representatives of the United States, Russia, the Balkans, Latin America and other countries; lastly, we have held over 800 Council working group meetings."
"The future Presidency of the European Union must therefore be highly structured and must be assigned to someone with the youth and energy to sustain this level of obligations."
"I am too old, Mr Schulz, for this kind of thing; but thank you anyway."
"With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I would point out that it was opened 18 days ago."
"The Presidency initiated a debate, which was open albeit brief, that could not and cannot be prevented."
"In fact, I do not believe that it is conceivable in a college of Heads of State or Government, to refuse or deny each government the opportunity to set out the position of their country on a constitutional treaty."
"The Presidency’s task was to listen, to expand upon each topic of discussion and it will subsequently be to condense this all into a global proposal, which is exactly what we are preparing to do."
"The issues which are still unresolved, as you know, mainly concern institutional questions: the double majority voting system, the composition of the Commission – as has been widely pointed out here – the review of the Constitutional Treaty with the possible extension of qualified majority voting to other areas."
"I expect, within a few weeks, when we have completed the detailed – but, I repeat, open and transparent – examination of all the issues before us, to draw up a global proposal."
"It will be my job to contact, on a bilateral basis, the relevant persons in the different countries in order to discuss it probably at an informal meeting of the European Council, between 15 and 30 November and, at last, have the final proposal ready in mid-December."
"One thing, of course, is clear, and that is that Europe and its citizens expect a high quality Constitutional Treaty; that is, an end product equal to the challenges to which we will increasingly be required to respond."
"We cannot accept compromises which reduce the European Union’s ability to make decisions and to make them swiftly and efficiently; we therefore cannot conceive that the defence of individual national interests – which is, however, right and understandable – could stop us having a constituent result necessary to consolidate the integration of Europe which is enlarging and uniting with an ever growing number of new Member States."
"In December, when the Presidency’s global proposal has been considered, expanded on and discussed, the time to decide will come."
"We will ask everyone to endorse, with clear and transparent responsibility, a complete constituent draft which, I repeat, must be high and noble."
"Failing this, European citizens will be called to vote in June without any knowledge of the new institutions and the faith of these citizens in the European Union and its progressive integration would be lost or be greatly reduced."
"This integration is a decisive factor in meeting the challenge of making Europe capable of taking a leading part on the international stage, capable of facing, with dignity, any other international power on equal terms, capable not only of strengthening the democracy, freedom, well-being and security of its citizens but also of disseminating these resources throughout the world."
"It is worthwhile considering this very point because we have all made a commitment, again recently with the Millennium Declaration, to give food, water, heath and education to those in the world who do not have them."
"These are important material resources but we know full well that, if they are not preceded by the first resource, that is freedom – which results in democracy as a form of government- then there is no possibility of providing and guaranteeing these resources in the long term to those citizens of the world who are still lacking them."
"I believe that when assessing – as I have been doing during recent days and nights – the final articles of the Constitutional Treaty, we must be clear that this Treaty will be in force for our fellow citizens for the next 10, 20 years, and that it must give our Union, as the seat of the most ancient civilisation, as a group of states and citizens which identify with a common heritage of values, principles, cultures and civilisation, the chance to be a protagonist in the world, to carry out, together with other countries and not in conflict with other countries, the duty of exporting to the world precisely that important resource of freedom and democracy, which alone can guarantee well-being for the people, which alone can effectively guarantee a truly peaceful future for the whole world."
"There are other more specific matters, which Mr Tajani has already answered in part, such as the European Prosecutor."
"We shall abide by the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"As far as the environmental dimension is concerned, I would point out that paragraph 24 of the Conclusions includes the environmental dimension in the growth process as a factor which will work as a catalyst for innovation and modernisation in key sectors such as energy and transport."
"In conclusion, I would like to remind you that, in effect, we have already obtained tangible results, and this gives us hope for the further deliberations of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have obtained results in an area where there were seemingly insurmountable divisions: European defence."
"The work of this European Council – which will take tangible form in the Council’s work in December – has given rise to the realisation by all the countries of the European Union, including the 10 new countries which are joining us, that there can be no true European Union foreign policy which carries weight, which is authoritative, if we are not backed up by an independent European defence force."
"The system of enhanced cooperation – or structured cooperation, as the case may be – has also been accepted, a system which allows certain countries which have greater military capacity and have the possibility and intention of spending on defence, to join together, but on three very clear conditions."
"Firstly, that this cooperation is open at all times to all Member States of the European Union which wish to participate in it; secondly, that the criteria and rules according to which this cooperation is set in motion do not stem from a decision made by the States which initially establish this cooperation, but are approved by the European Council."
"It will be decided in December whether this approval must – and I hope not – be given by unanimous voting or by qualified majority voting."
"The third condition is that European defence must not be seen as an alternative to NATO but as a complement to NATO itself, which we still consider to be one of the pillars that has ensured over half a century of peace and security in Europe."
"I can only promise you all that we will approach these final 50 working days with the greatest dedication and, with regard to the Constitutional Treaty, with a clear idea in mind at all times."
"We will not be able – just for the pride and satisfaction – to close the Intergovernmental Conference under the Italian Presidency."
"Such a thing has never happened before, because the five Intergovernmental Conferences which preceded this latest one opened under one Presidency and always closed under other Presidencies."
"We, too, even though we are trying to arrive at a conclusion and even though we know that the European citizens will be summoned to the polls next spring and that we must therefore do everything possible, or rather, more than everything possible, in order to let them know what the roles and overall ambit within which the Parliament whose Members they will be called upon to elect will have to operate, will never agree to go so far as signing a compromise, a Constitutional Treaty, which cannot assure Europe, and by extension its citizens, that it will perform what we all believe must be its duty in the coming years."
"The Italian Presidency will therefore do all it can to complete the work by December, but will not allow this work to result in a watered-down Constitutional text, which favours the interests of individual States rather than defending the common interest of us all, which is, of course, the common good."
". Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for this debate, which has been extremely interesting and which has provided us with ideas for our future action."
"I thank Mr Berlusconi for the desire he expressed to close the Intergovernmental Conference with a powerful, and not a watered-down text, and I also thank him for having stressed the need for a sense of continuity in the institutions, and the difficulty of this continuous, fast rotation."
"The Commission is aware of its duty to ensure the continuity of the institutional work of politics: we have done so throughout recent years consistently, loyally and with dedication, and indeed, this very evening, I am going to Dublin for talks with the Irish Prime Minister, precisely to ensure this continuity and so that the work we are doing is not fragmented by the continual changes that take place."
"Turning to the issues that we must touch on, I would like to make some very simple observations."
"Many interventions referred to the question of the Commission’s composition."
"I would like to clarify once again that the draft Convention already includes one Commissioner per Member State."
"What we do not accept is that half are working Commissioners and half are ghost Commissioners; but there is already one Commissioner per Member State."
"We must make all Commissioners visible with the same powers and able to lay down European policy."
"It is by no means the case that having one Commissioner from each Member State would mean that national interests are represented: already, in the present Commission, the Commissioners, I am glad to say, do not represent national interests but the common interest."
"A second problem which has emerged and which is of great interest was mentioned by Mr Bonde."
"I was a little surprised, I must say, when he came out in favour of a referendum in each Member State, because I thought that he agreed with the principle of subsidiarity, whereby each country chooses the method with which to adopt their Constitution."
"If a referendum is necessary – as Mr Karas said a while ago – then we should have a European referendum."
"You understand, then, that it would all take on a different significance: all we would need is the Constitution as decided here, approved by a European referendum, and it would assume infinitely greater significance, it would be something altogether different."
"I really would ask you to reflect on this."
"I know full well that it sounds too good to be true, but there are times in history when a decision of this kind is sufficient to change the face and life of our institutions."
"The third issue: the quality of investments."
"The quality of investments was raised, and I would like to clarify that the quick-start list is not going to create priorities and exclusions."
"That is not what we intend; rather, we want to identify the projects which are the most mature, most transnational, most likely to mobilise resources and confidence rapidly."
"Confidence, Mrs Frassoni, also and above all means social and environmental sustainability, in line with the policies of the Commission, which, over recent months, let us not forget, has sought to establish itself in the highly sensitive area of energy policy, dedicating a large part of our resources to research into hydrogen and alternative energies."
"Moreover, the extremely sensitive question of the protection and health of the environment and the chemical industry was raised."
"It may, indeed, be the case that we have had to make compromises, especially at a difficult time in terms of the economy: I do not rule that out, because we have to make compromises every day, but I want to assure Mrs Frassoni that we are at the forefront of the world – very much so – with the substantial costs that this entails."
"However, we want to be, as we were for Kyoto, because we know full well that, as the European Union, we have to shoulder a responsibility which is distinct from the responsibility shouldered by the individual countries, the individual nations."
"Similarly, as the European Union, we have to shoulder responsibility – and here I am looking at the candle, the large candle, still alight in front of Mr Watson – with regard to the Guantanamo issue, on which I cannot fail to agree with the concerns expressed regarding the state of the prisoners."
"Without making simplistic judgments, I can say that, if a case of this kind happened within the European Union, it would probably be considered under the scope of the procedure laid down by Article 7."
"Today, however, we must also recognise that detainees in the Member States are detained precisely in the Member States, and we must make it clear in practical terms that we expect these citizens’ rights to be vigorously defended by the authority of their States."
"Lastly, to conclude the foreign policy issues, Mr Wurtz made strong reference to the Geneva Plan."
"I was very pleased by this because it is the first time that a practical initiative has been put forward by the Palestinians and Israelis and not by the – albeit extremely valuable – initiatives of the Quartet and external bodies."
"They will not be representatives of the governments of both sides, but they are representatives of enormous intellectual and moral stature."
"I would like to remind the President of Parliament here of the skill with which the Speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, led the Israeli Knesset at difficult times and the very real enthusiasm he generated with his speeches, his discussions and also his critical remarks."
"They will make a contribution, which I hope will be decisive, to peace in Israel and we, I can assure the honourable Member, will be ready to seize it with the sensitivity necessary in these cases."
"It is clear that this is a Palestinian and Israeli process, not a process conducted by the world powers relating to Israel and the Palestinians; it is from these quarters that we are awaiting a message that will enable us to achieve peace in the Middle East together."
"With regard to immigration, Mr Brok referred to the European policy which he called ‘wider Europe’; I prefer to call it the ring of friends policy, that is the policy of having around us – from Moscow, from Russia to Morocco – countries with which we have a close, solid relationship based on friendship."
"This is the implementation of ‘soft security’, of that security policy which Europe has entrusted to dialogue, to economic bonds, to cultural bonds. It is in this context that we must place the issue of immigration."
"We have already taken two major steps forward: cooperation on policing – which really is a step forward – and the agency to coordinate our action."
"Mr Pirker raised some legitimate objections with regard to the agency and the danger of duplicating it."
"However, we want to ensure, precisely, that this is a body at the service of the European institutions to coordinate our action."
"This is the first part, but it is not enough, it is not enough!"
"This is a means of internal defence, but we need an initiative to manage and keep the immigrants in their countries of origin."
"Clearly, therefore, we must make a twofold agreement with these countries, on the protection and the control of immigrants, giving them the possibility to interact and also to reap a legitimate benefit from this."
"The quota policy, rejected by the Council, perhaps partly because the term ‘quota’ is inappropriate, is absolutely essential."
"I would call it an agreement with these countries to guarantee them a minimum emigration level so that they help us to protect our borders."
"There is no alternative: if we live among friendly countries, we will succeed in resolving this tragic problem; if we do not live among friendly countries, they will continue, with a hostile approach, to send us emigrants, exploiting them, and we will no longer know what position to adopt or what decisions to take."
"We should remember this: initially soft, passive defence, and then an active agreement with these countries."
"Lastly, many of you rightly raised the question, the fear of falling into the clutches of economic decline."
"This is a serious, disbursing problem, which combines with the concerns that the German, French and British Governments have, together, expressed over the risk of European deindustrialisation."
"We must not forget that this is an extremely serious matter, upon which we will have to reflect and work in the future because we cannot accept protectionist solutions which would leave us even worse off."
"Together, we must, by applying the lessons of Lisbon to this new situation, give Europe the impetus it needs."
"The fundamentals of our economy are strong, and are much stronger than those of other economies which are currently lecturing us and telling us how to proceed."
"Let us remember, however, that, although they are necessary, the structural reforms which Mr Fiori rightly mentioned in his speech do not suffice."
"We need energy and coordination between us all, a sense of mission, of what everyone expects from European politics."
"We are experiencing a highly absurd situation: all our governments and countries are expecting us to provide an industrial policy, a financial policy, a common and coordinated research policy to free us from those clutches of economic decline; the peoples are calling for this, the governments are calling for this, but then, when it comes to taking the necessary steps to resolve the crisis and achieve these objectives, that is when national interests, fears and conservatism prevent us taking action."
"We have been experiencing this absurd situation for too long; we must find a way out, and Parliament and the Commission are being called on by the European peoples to overcome this very situation."
"Together we have to do this."
"Mr President, we do not have the chance to come back on this debate, and I do not wish to trespass on the goodwill of those in the House."
"I would simply ask the presidency and the Commission to explain why we should expect Europe's voters to vote for Europe if we do not have the solidarity and the commitment within the Commission and Council to stand up for the rights to which our continent has subscribed."
"I should like to thank everyone who has contributed to today's debate, which was a reflective, calm and good-tempered exchange of views."
"The debate is closed."
"– The conclusions of the European Council of 16-17 October 2003 reveal that the Heads of State or Government are persisting with the same neoliberal policy, showing complete indifference to socio-economic problems."
"It is unacceptable to continue giving priority to enhancing the competitiveness of businesses on the basis of further liberalisation and privatisation, further pay cuts and flexibility, instead of solving the problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion."
"Even the so-called ‘European Initiative for Growth’ will fail as long as the limitations imposed by monetary policy remain in place. Those limitations also bring the risk that funding for large projects will come to depend on the whim of the financial markets."
"The Stability Pact needs revising more than ever, in such a way as to take into account employment, education, training and sustainable development."
"As for the Intergovernmental Conference, what was revealed there is worrying, especially the unacceptable financial blackmail practised by some Member States, who are threatening to block the Community budget so as to obtain an agreement based on the so-called European Constitution."
"It is equally regrettable that the Council has not put in place the measures needed to bring an end to the occupation of Iraq, so as to ensure that the Iraqi people will be able to claim their inalienable right to determine their own future and exploit their rich resources."
"Colleagues, I should like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to Mr Olivier Kamitatu Etsu, the President of the transitional Parliament of the Democratic Republic of Congo who, together with a delegation of that parliament, has joined us in the official gallery."
"I wish them a productive stay in Strasbourg.(1)"
"I would like to inform you of something which our President said at the opening of proceedings this morning, when, however, not all the MEPs were present in the Chamber."
"It is important and noteworthy: for the first time, during this sitting we have three new interpreters’ booths in operation."
"For today’s debate we have interpretation into three of the new languages, that is, Polish, Hungarian and Czech."
"The channels are 12 for Czech, 13 for Hungarian and 14 for Polish.(1)"
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"– Mr President, I am requesting the floor for a few minutes to ask for the assistance of the Presidency and to explain the clearly irregular situation which has arisen in this report."
"An amendment by my group, voted for by the immense majority of the committee, has surprisingly disappeared from the text being voted on today."
"That amendment called for the recognition of the right to asylum for women who suffer serious persecution and violations of their human rights."
"For this reason, Mr President, and on behalf of my group, I would ask that we postpone the vote on the Smet report until the services of the House clarify this situation, which we believe to be immensely serious."
".– Mr President, a correction to the text has been made after very lengthy negotiations."
"I will read out this correction and would ask the Socialist MEPs whether it ultimately reflects what they have asked for."
"If not, I agree that it should be sent back."
"I will read out what the text of paragraph 13 should be, because there have indeed been a number of difficulties, partly because sections have been deleted from the text."
"‘Calls upon the Member States to take into account persecution and/or the fear of persecution which may be suffered by women on account of their sex.’"
"Mr President, in support of Mrs Valenciano’s intervention, and in view of the fact that this really was a significant procedural violation, I would like to support her proposal, which does not entail referring the report to the committee but simply delaying the vote so that matters can be clarified."
"We support Mrs Valenciano’s position, which, in procedural terms, is absolutely right."
"I shall put to the vote Mrs Valenciano’s request to postpone the vote."
"– Mr President, further down the voting list there is a vote on several resolutions on the oral question on the liberal professions."
"I would like to ask that this be removed from the agenda and deferred until the next part-session in Brussels."
"This has also been agreed with the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"We want to try to find a compromise resolution rather than vote on these contradictory resolutions."
"I shall put to the vote the request to postpone the vote."
". Recent food scandals clearly illustrate that food safety is at risk, especially given that an obsession with profit, combined with a lack of controls and, very often, permissive legislation, seem to take precedence over public health concerns."
"Food additives, the ‘E numbers’ we often see on the labels of food products, come into the equation via the agri-foodstuffs industry. From preservatives to colourings, they serve specific purposes and should be effectively controlled in order to assess the risk they pose to public health."
"Framework Directive 89/107/EEC, on food additives, provides for the adoption of specific directives with a view to harmonising the use of different categories of additives in foodstuffs."
"It is in this context that amendments have been tabled to Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs."
"I therefore support the European Parliament’s two main proposals. The first of these prohibits trade in and use of sweeteners not conforming with the revised Community legislation until stocks are exhausted, while the second withdraws the Commission’s power to decide whether or not a substance is a sweetener until such time as the framework legislation is revised."
". The aim of this report is to update the terms of use of certain products, in light of the scientific studies available on the undesirable side effects which these substances may have on humans and the acceptable daily intakes fixed by the Scientific Committee for Food."
"Like the rapporteur, I fail to see why the Commission should have responsibility for deciding whether or not a substance is a sweetener until such time as Framework Directive 89/107/EC on food additives is revised. I agree that the Commission’s powers in this area may be extended only when the aforementioned Framework Decision is revised, as the Commission has stated it will be in the course of this year."
"The proposal that the Commission draw up a report outlining the progress made in the re-evaluations of all additives within two years of the entry into force of this Directive should be welcomed, as should the measure designed to avoid the abuse of temporary exemptions for products which do not comply with this legislation."
"I voted in favour."
". I should like to take advantage of the vote to point out the following:"
"First, my agreement with the European Parliament proposals for higher compensation margins."
"Secondly, this requirement should not result in higher premiums for citizens, given that insurance companies have a great deal of room for manoeuvre, in conjunction with the measures being proposed by the Italian Presidency to improve road safety and reduce road traffic accidents."
"Τhirdly, the importance of the insured's having a priority claim over creditors in the event of the bankruptcy of an insurance company."
". This Directive aims to modernise previous directives on motor vehicle insurance."
"The proposal seeks not only to harmonise at Community level the different provisions of national legislation, but also to encourage the free circulation of goods and persons."
"Previous directives put in place a requirement for all Community vehicles to be insured against civil liability, for valid insurance certificates to be awarded in all the Member States, for compulsory cover for all vehicle passengers, the establishment of guarantee funds, and the famous Green Card."
"Since I come from a country which, unfortunately, suffers from one of the worst road safety records, one of the lowest levels of cover and of damages arising from compulsory motor vehicle insurance, I welcome any initiative aiming to enhance the protection afforded motor accident victims by compulsory insurance through swifter procedures and higher levels of minimum cover, providing Member States’ ability to go further is not threatened."
"While I support the rapporteur’s original proposals to increase the amount of the minimum sum insured to EUR 10 million per accident for personal injury, and to EUR 5 million per accident for damage to property, I regret the fact that that this position has been replaced by a compromise involving smaller amounts."
". Mr Rothley is a remarkable kind of Social Democrat."
"He always does the opposite of what you would expect a member of his group to do."
"In June, his major achievement was that he provided for a considerably higher salary for all MEPs other than the already excessively paid Germans and Italians."
"Years previous to that, he had claimed that his intention in doing this was to enhance Parliament's dignity."
"Now, as rapporteur, he is proposing in his Amendment No 15 to exclude pedestrians and cyclists from bodily injury cover in the drivers' legal liability insurance, irrespective of whether the driver is at fault."
"His motive is now that this concerns a delicate and very controversial problem, one that is better regulated in a separate legal instrument."
"If this separate legal instrument were to come into being at the same time as this directive, then there would be nothing wrong with his argument."
"However, Mr Rothley knows very well that this House has no right of initiative."
"If we were to reject this component, we would need to wait and see whether the Commission were ever to table this separate proposal."
"If this proposal were to be tabled, Mr Rothley anticipates possible further problems."
"In that way, the weakest party is put at a disadvantage."
"That is why I reject this proposal."
". I voted in favour."
"This new proposal for a fifth Directive on motor vehicle insurance aims to amend the existing directives by plugging gaps and solving the practical problems facing the citizens of the Member States."
"Indeed, insurance premiums covering temporary stays in another Member State and short-term insurance covering vehicles bought outside their owners’ Member State of residence are legal mechanisms which the Community did not tackle in the past, as were the updating of existing provisions on the amount of minimum cover which motorists should enjoy and increased protection for pedestrians and cyclists involved in accidents."
"On another matter, one of the most important aspects of this report concerns resetting the minimum levels of guarantees for personal injury and damage to property, in the context of the wider trend to promote victims’ rights."
"The recognition of every Member State’s right to demand that drivers of certain types of vehicles (trailers, agricultural machinery, and so forth) produce valid proof of insurance cover while driving such a vehicle on their territory also deserves my support."
"Unlike the Commission, the European Parliament pronounces itself in favour of compensation based upon each accident rather than upon each injured person."
"As a result, the level of compensation per person would only be half as high in the case of an accident in which two people were injured."
"It would be as if there had only been one injured person."
"I find that odd, in fact downright absurd."
"For that reason, I have voted against the European Parliament’s position and, instead, supported the Commission’s line."
". Conservative MEPs accord a very great importance to issues of parental responsibility and the protection of children."
"It is, unfortunately, an unavoidable fact that the European Community is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area."
"However, we believe that parental responsibility should remain the right of a parent within the competence of individual Member States and, as such, cannot support a report which gives the Council the right to instruct Member States to hand over their autonomy in this area."
". I welcome the political agreement reached by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on the draft regulation on recognition and enforcement in the Community of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility, based on common rules on jurisdiction, especially with regard to issues relating to the return of the child, emphasising that the child’s best interests must be the primary consideration in all judicial decisions relating to children."
"The formal adoption of this regulation can only take place, however, when a decision is adopted authorising the Member States to ratify the Hague Convention of 1996, in the interest of the Community."
"That is the background to the initiative we have debated today, and its urgent nature."
"Its aim is to authorise the Member States to ratify or accede to that Convention in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children (the Community cannot become a party to the Hague Convention). It is incumbent on the Member States, therefore, to take the necessary steps to enable the Community to become a member."
"In doing so, we will bring the European Union closer to the citizens, and above all to those unfortunate enough to experience the heartbreak of separation or divorce, which are enough of a tragedy already without making matters worse by affecting the rights and welfare of children."
". I agree with the rapporteur’s view that the Member States’ ratifying or acceding to the Hague Convention of 1996 will help to provide better protection for the rights of children in respect of parental responsibility, so that, as the rapporteur says, ‘in all decisions relating to children, the child’s best interests remain a primary consideration’."
"I welcome the proposals intended to ensure that the Convention enters into force as early as possible."
"I do not, however, have any truck with the federalist thinking underpinning this report. In particular, I must highlight how ironic and inexplicable it is to suggest that the Member States need Council authorisation in order to ratify or accede to this Convention."
". I am with the rapporteur when she states that establishing a harmonised and standardised judicial area is a vitally important element in the advancement of European integration in the sphere of parental responsibility."
"This proposal is an interesting step in that direction."
"In fact, it aims to authorise the Member States to ratify or accede to the Hague Convention in the interest of the European Union, thereby overcoming the technical problem that only sovereign states may be parties to that Convention."
"The significance of this is that the Hague Convention relates to jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition, enforcement and cooperation in respect of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children, and has already been the main inspiration for the future Council regulation on parental responsibility, which the Council is still debating."
"I disagree with the rapporteur, however, when she seeks to base her arguments on Article 24(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Consideration of the child’s best interests should be invoked for its intrinsically high value, not because it is called for in a text which, in any case, lacks any legal value at present."
"Nevertheless, since this is a matter of ensuring that, in all judicial decisions relating to children, the child’s best interests remain a primary consideration, I support the rapporteur’s proposals."
"."
"The Hague Convention entered into force on 1 January 2002 and concerns Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children."
"It is, therefore, now crucial that the Member States do everything that is needed to ensure that the Union complies with the Convention."
"The European Union is working towards establishing a common judicial area founded on the principle of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions."
"We must ensure that every judicial decision prioritises the interests of the child."
"We have a duty to protect our children, who are tomorrow’s adult citizens."
"Our society can only move forwards for the good of everyone if we are able to watch over the way our children are brought up, and over their physical and psychological development."
"Working for children’s rights means working for human rights, protecting them against violence, institutional violence in particular, and this will prepare them for a world of peace."
". I should like to take advantage of the vote to point out the following:"
"First, my concern about the positions taken at the Council meeting in Rome on 21 October by the United Kingdom, Holland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, who are in favour of reducing regional subsidies."
"Secondly, the need for enlargement not to work against the development potential of the regions of the existing 15 Member States of the Union."
"Thirdly, the importance of the Aegean islands' acquiring the same privileges as the remote regions of the Union."
"We welcome more efficient administration of the Structural Funds."
"At the same time, we believe it would be risky to administer the resources in a single fund, as recommended in Mr Pittella’s report, because it could lead to smaller projects disappearing."
"Instead, priority should be given to a harmonisation of the rules concerning the use of the funds."
"I congratulate Mr Pittella on the report he has produced. This makes a contribution to the complex debate on the Structural Funds."
"I would nevertheless like to draw attention to two points on which the rapporteur’s approach differs from mine, and which led me to table two draft amendments for which I request the support of this House. The amendments are:"
"- Amendment to paragraph 23 of the motion for a resolution: I would like to reiterate the great importance of mentioning the principle of legitimate expectation, in relation to the eligibility of advances granted by Member States to final beneficiaries and their inclusion in reimbursement claims received before 31 December 2002."
"The principles of solidarity, flexibility and effectiveness complement rather than compete with each other."
"- Amendment to paragraph 35(b) of the motion for a resolution: in accordance with the principle of simplification, and on the basis of one of the aims of improving the utilisation of the funds, I propose that provisions be made for an opportunity to analyse whether combining the funds and centralising the way they are managed would help to improve their efficiency."
"This will all depend on the course events actually take, which will allow us to decide at a later date whether such an analysis is appropriate."
". This report conducts a thorough and worrying examination of various questions linked to the implementation of the Structural Funds."
"These funds constitute a system for the redistribution of wealth via the Community budget with a view to reducing the disparities in development among the Member States and increasing economic and social cohesion."
"Over the years, they have made visible progress towards those aims."
"Nonetheless, it is clear that the delay in implementing the Funds and the corresponding instruments and initiatives is becoming progressively worse. This is due, in large part, to two factors."
"On the one hand, the Funds very often do not effectively become available until the next programming period is already under way, while, on the other, the procedures are long and complicated. The European Commission, therefore, needs to deal with these matters more thoroughly and consider making more ambitious changes to procedures, combating the late approval and implementation of the programmes and the unreliable nature of the financial forecasts."
"In accordance with the aims of the Lisbon strategy of 2000, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds must be enhanced, and, in particular, coordination between the various departments of the Community, national and regional administrations must be improved."
"As proposed in the report, it is very important to find a balance between desirable simplification measures and the controls required in order to achieve economic and social cohesion, bearing in mind the current challenge of enlargement as well."
"Hence my vote in favour."
". I could not agree more with the proposals of both the Committee of Independent Experts and the European Parliament that, in each Member State, a single directorate-general should be entirely responsible for the implementation of the Structural Funds."
"This would improve coordination between the various departments of the Community, national and regional administrations involved."
"I would also like to point up the need to concentrate more funding on project quality and on the real impact of the Structural Funds in the regions concerned."
"That concludes the vote."
"(2)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0348/2003) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, including the financial implications for the general budget of the European Communities – 2002 (7038/2003 – C5-0423/2003 – 2003/2141(INI))."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a number of comments by way of an introduction to this annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"It takes as its starting point the dramatic events of the Iraq war and the effect that had on the European Union’s internal cohesion, on transatlantic relations and also on the state of affairs within the United Nations and NATO, as well as on the international order as a whole."
"What now matters, in our view, is that we see the crisis associated with the war in Iraq as an opportunity, and accept the challenge of establishing Europe, once and for all, as a foreign policy actor of substance."
"Europe must cease to be an observer in global policy matters and become a participant."
"The constitutional convention created the institutional framework within which it can do so by creating the position of European Foreign Minister, by making enhanced cooperation possible in the defence sphere and also by establishing the European armaments agency."
"These proposals represent an absolute minimum, and the Intergovernmental Conference must not now be allowed to water them down."
"We expected much more when it comes to the Council’s voting procedures and Parliament’s right to be informed and consulted, and so, in the light of a proactive policy of crisis prevention, we believe it to be necessary for us, in future, to be informed and involved as early as the early-warning and planning stages of crisis operations under the ESDP."
"Both the CFSP and the ESDP need an efficient institutional framework, but that will not be enough; it must have political content added to it."
"This is what the European security doctrine put forward by Mr Solana is for, and this report gives four reasons for endorsing his approach."
"The first is that Europe must find its way to a clear prioritisation of its foreign and security policy interests and objectives, jointly define them and also designate them geographically, as we have done under item 8."
"The second is that a European security strategy must counterpose to the narrowly military focus in current thinking by the American administration a comprehensive approach to security that includes political, economic, social and inter-cultural efforts to mitigate and resolve conflicts."
"Thirdly, a European security doctrine can be developed only on the basis of effective multilateralism and within the UN system, this being in line with the historic experiences and political interests of its Member States."
"Fourthly, even though the prevention and resolution of conflicts by non-military means will always be at the heart of any security strategy adopted by the European Union, the credibility of the European Foreign and Security Policy is, in the final analysis, dependent on the quality of its military capabilities and on the political willingness to deploy them in the event of any conflict."
"What, in the context of a European concept of security, are our foreign policy priorities?"
"Although transatlantic relations still have pride of place among them, Europe will carry equal weight as a partner for the USA only as and when the Member States summon up the political will to make their own specifically national interests subject to those of the Community."
"We will also be able to strengthen such organisations as the UN or NATO only if Europe and the USA speak with one voice."
"New life must be breathed into the strategic debate between Europe and the USA; that is another reason why Mr Solana’s paper is so important."
"It will cover such topics as the stabilisation, reconstruction and state building in Iraq, a common strategy on Iran and, generally speaking, possible ways of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the tactics to be adopted when dealing with repressive and dictatorial regimes and dysfunctional states."
"One primary task that remains is that of bringing peace to the Middle East as part of the Quartet, where it has to be clear to us that the Quartet, rather than merely being present on paper, should perhaps work together in the region."
"There is no doubt that Europe will continue to be committed to the Western Balkans and in Afghanistan, whatever the many problems that are evident in both of them, and even though we cannot but be openly pessimistic about our chances of success when it comes to properly building an acceptable state in the latter."
"Much more attention needs to be given to the Southern Caucasus, which is becoming one of the EU’s least stable neighbouring regions, and in this, relations with Russia will have a large part to play."
"With enlargement, the Union’s external borders are being drawn ever closer to the crisis areas to the east and south-east."
"It is of the utmost importance that security zones be established around Europe, and that an effective neighbourhood policy be developed; our deliberations should therefore focus much more on such ideas as a ‘European Economic Area Plus’ and others of the kind, as well as on consideration of the particular ways in which the Mediterranean region can be further stabilised."
"Finally, I would like to explain our criticisms of the Council’s annual report."
"Anyone picking up this 200-page volume will observe that it more resembles a shop’s inventory than an annual political review."
"Things used not to be as bad as that."
"Such a report is no use when it comes to conducting dialogue between Parliament and the Council."
"It must become more political, as it once was, with clear evaluations and the setting of objectives."
"It is for that reason that we ask that the High Representative should continue, in future, to provide us with a written report on the progress made in putting Europe’s security principles into practice."
"Let me finish by saying something about the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This annual report will be the last in the life of this current Parliament."
"It shows the positions of the political groups coinciding to a remarkable degree, in a way that they have not done since this Parliament was elected."
"That is another fruit of the constructive collaboration in this committee, for which I wish to express my gratitude to the committee’s members and its staff."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened to Mr Brok's comments just now with great interest and very much appreciate what he said."
"Let me start with this point: MrBrok is quite right in saying that a new situation has recently emerged with regard to the Iraq crisis, which has had such an enormous and unprecedented impact on our common foreign policy that some observers believe it casts doubt on the very survival of the CFSP."
"Against this backdrop, I wish to say that I totally disagree with the notion that Iraq has destroyed our Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Quite the opposite, in fact: the ill ease felt by Member States about the divisions created by the Iraq crisis and the commitment that we have made to overcoming the existing deadlock have demonstrated, if anything, the extent to which all of us in Europe are firmly committed to a common foreign policy."
"My second point is that the Common Foreign and Security Policy now faces a real systemic challenge in the form of enlargement, or, as we like to put it, the reunification of the European Union."
"If we are unable to find institutional solutions, there is a risk that the deadlock situations we have experienced will recur."
"My third point concerns the role of the Union on the world stage."
"There is no denying that the Union has global interests, which are certainly not limited to economic interests, and that it should be willing to defend the values which inspire and are at the heart of our peoples' lives and rules of life."
"My question, however, is this: is the Union able and willing to be considered a global power?"
"I believe that, even if we have limited resources at our disposal and should, therefore, be selective about where we intervene, it is, nevertheless, in Europe's wider interest to adopt a global approach as regards both our analysis and our foreign policy endeavour."
"What conclusions can we draw from our awareness of these three problems, which undeniably exist?"
"It is important to recognise that the Union's record in the field of foreign policy is a positive one, and the Brok report confirms this."
"I shall restrict myself to mentioning the progress made in establishing a European military capacity and our initial experiences with this both in conjunction with NATO – an example of this being the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – and also acting on our own, as in the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I would also like to mention the Union’s contribution to stabilising the Balkans and to the process of both economic and democratic reconstruction of the countries in that region."
"I would further remind you about the support given to the United Nations at a point when the role of that organisation was being called into question."
"We, as Europeans, have reiterated the validity of a multilateral approach to crisis resolution, and, as a more ambitious objective, the implementation of effective multilateralism as a means of preventing, and, if necessary, opposing breaches of international law."
"I would also like to mention the significant action taken by the Union and its Member States in response to the global challenges we face today: combating terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I have just mentioned a few important areas by way of example, to demonstrate that we have, in a number of cases, succeeded in following words and commitments with deeds."
"Of course, and I agree with Mr Brok's report on this point, this is not enough to satisfy the demands that the citizens of Europe and the third countries are making of us."
"The Council of Ministers is aware of this, and we are working towards solutions in two areas: institutional effectiveness and the clear, precise setting of strategic priorities."
"As regards institutional effectiveness – which President Berlusconi has already talked about here in this Chamber today – I can confirm that, in the Intergovernmental Conference, we will be defending the framework presented by the Convention, without any backsliding, as a good basis for the work of the IGC."
"With regard to the second area, strategy, as you know, the European Council scheduled for December 2003 will be called upon to adopt a document that will include the Union's security strategy."
"It is an ambitious text that will provide a framework for all the interest and commitment invested in our Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The strategy will outline the threats currently facing the European Union, but it also needs to identify those areas on whose stability our security depends."
"This strategy will be able to guide us in identifying the resources needed for us to become producers of security, as we like to say, and no longer just consumers of security."
"That is why the Italian Presidency is anxious to foster fruitful cooperation between our common foreign policy and the activities of international organisations active in the field of security."
"I have in mind, first and foremost, NATO and the OSCE, but what is absolutely vital for us is the role of the United Nations."
"On 24 September, the Italian Presidency and the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, signed a UN-EU joint declaration in New York as a basis for cooperation in both military and civilian areas of crisis management."
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that everyone should now recognise that there is a need to take pre-emptive action, rather than just repairing the damage resulting from a crisis that has already exploded."
"Prevention is therefore becoming a key component in the Union's external relations."
"This derives from and is characterised by the coordinated use of both the resources of the Member States, which are made available in the common interest, and the Union's own resources, which are managed by the European Commission."
"We accordingly need to take advantage of the full range of resources that the Union can harness in crisis situations."
"We have instruments that enable us to exert cultural, economic, political and, now, also military influence."
"More than any other international organisation, the Union can and should commit itself to tackling the underlying causes of conflicts by helping to eliminate them through pre-emptive action."
"We are adopting a policy based on influence and incentivation in order to try and encourage progress in regional integration and to overcome situations caused by lack of understanding and by instability."
"This is the successful model on which we have built the European Union, and it is for this reason that we are convinced it is a model worth recommending to our external partners."
"In particular, I would like to mention the Western Balkans, a sensitive region that deserves special attention."
"We are endeavouring to step up our cooperation activities in respect of that region, and also in respect of the southern shore of the Mediterranean, and, let me remind you, in respect of the Latin American subcontinent."
"On the same subject, I would like to point out that the benefit of establishing treaty relations with the European Union is, in fact, one of the main incentives for regional groupings."
"Our security policy therefore dovetails with our policy on development aid in terms of goals, but we should certainly not imagine that it can be a substitute for development aid policy or be allowed to drain resources away from it."
"As we know, Mr Brok's report stresses that the Union's interest should focus on its neighbouring regions."
"Although I have mentioned the Balkans and the Mediterranean region, I wish to emphasise that the difficulties still prevailing in the Middle East have not weakened our resolve: the Union can and must make an important contribution to identifying a peaceful solution and to international guarantees for peace."
"The Presidency, the High Representative and the Commission are constantly striving to achieve this outcome, and they were encouraged by the final conclusions of last week's European Council."
"The Council also confirmed the Union's stance on two other international issues currently of vital importance: Iraq, where the Union is committed to contributing to the reconstruction effort, and Iran, which we have very actively encouraged to take the decisive step of complying with all the International Atomic Energy Agency's requirements."
"Just yesterday, the Republic of Iran took the very positive step of accepting these commitments, with the full support of the presidency. This is obviously something that we have encouraged and welcome."
"Another area of interest for the enlarged Europe is its eastern borders."
"I have in mind our good-neighbour policy towards Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, and slightly further east, the Russian Federation, which I shall return to this afternoon when we discuss the forthcoming Rome Summit on 6 November."
"I would like to conclude my comments by referring to a strategic relationship that is still of fundamental importance for us in Europe: the transatlantic relationship."
"It is evident that all the Member States continue to attach great importance to relations with the United States."
"I, personally, also believe that we can overcome the recent breakdowns in understanding."
"The renewal of this relationship has been confirmed by the recent, hard-won decisions taken within the United Nations."
"I am convinced this is the case, because Euro-Atlantic relations are nourished by a common history, by an enormous indebtedness in terms of liberation and liberty – particularly for us Italians – and also by shared values and ideals and by common action reflected in the CFSP."
"Our common commitment in the Balkans, combating terrorism and combating proliferation: these are examples and evidence of common action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Brok has drawn up proposals for future work."
"I would like to thank him once again, and I agree with his suggestions and proposals."
"The building of Europe is unprecedented in history, both as regards its political ambition and its institutional mechanisms."
"I would like to conclude my speech by saying that there are essentially four areas in which we can work, which, for the sake of brevity I shall simply identify."
"The first area is to develop the political will to achieve integration, the hallmark of which will increasingly be foreign policy and the common European defence policy."
"In this area, the parliamentarians of the Member States will have an essential role to play, and I therefore hope that this Chamber will continue to provide encouragement and drive."
"The second area is a strategy for the Union's external activities, to be based on the document we shall be presenting by December."
"The third area relates to appropriate and effective decision-making mechanisms."
"We will be going into that in depth at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The fourth and final area is that of resources."
"Although I have left it until last, it is crucial."
"We must provide ourselves with the necessary resources to achieve the foreign policy we need."
"The alternative, which I do not like, would be to scale down our ambitions."
"We have limited budgetary provisions for financing the CFSP, and although we had a small increase in 2003, we certainly need to do a great deal more."
"The Italian Presidency understands and supports the European Parliament's request that it should be given punctual and timely, if not absolutely pre-emptive, information about activities that the European Council is preparing to embark upon. I remain committed to supporting you on this."
". Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which he knows I have much enjoyed reading."
"I do not want in the five minutes that I have to repeat all the points that have been made with such eloquence and comprehensiveness by the Italian Presidency but I agree with all that the Minister said."
"Perhaps I can just focus on four points very briefly and try to stick to my five minutes."
"First of all I want to say something about the institutional arrangements."
"We all know that the present institutional arrangements supporting and providing the infrastructure for CFSP are, to use a common term of art in the European Union, 'sub-optimal'."
"And we all know that changes in institutional arrangements, the sort of changes proposed in the Convention and being discussed in the IGC, can help to create political will to make things happen more effectively."
"But changes in institutions can never be a substitute for political will."
"We did not have disagreements over Iraq because we lacked the adequate institutional arrangements."
"We had disagreements over Iraq because of a lack of sufficient political will."
"It is also fair to say that however much we improve the institutional arrangements – and this was a point touched on by the presidency – we cannot pay the bills with institutional arrangements."
"If we want to have a more effective international impact, if we want to be seen by the United States as people who are pulling our weight in the security field, we have to face up to the fact that we need to do more and we need to spend more."
"All the opinion polls show – and this is an interesting reflection of the current debate in Europe – that most of our voters in Europe want there to be a louder European voice politically on the international stage."
"But unfortunately there is hardly any country where voters are prepared to spend more money on our security in order to help sustain that larger European role."
"Therefore we have to tackle the present gap between the discussion on institutional arrangements and the discussion both on political will and on resources."
"Second, I should like to mention security and the definition of security."
"We all know that security needs to be defined in much broader terms than has been conventional in foreign policy debate."
"One of the great bonuses of the draft security strategy which the High Representative has brought forward is that it demonstrates that security is about more than precision-guided munitions and airlift capacity."
"It is about issues from public health and disease to terrorism, to organised crime, all the issues where we in the European Union actually have the competence to develop a more coherent, comprehensive external relations policy than is possible in a lot of Member States and in a lot of nation-states."
"It is very important in my view, therefore, that when we come to construct a joint external service, we make sure that we combine the strengths of both Pillar I and Pillar II in the management and implementation of CFSP."
"It would be a great mistake if, on the one hand, we cut off the Foreign Minister from the Commission, or on the other hand, if we did the sort of things which would make people suspicious of the Commission being too involved in CFSP issues."
"So, we have to make sure that, as we design the joint external service, we use the strength of both the Council and the Commission to have the widest possible impact on external problems."
"The third point I want to make is about the importance of the transatlantic partnership."
"We know that in the run-up to the military intervention in Iraq, Europe was bitterly divided."
"I have said before that I am not wholly surprised about that since the issues that we were facing in Iraq were extremely difficult and extremely serious."
"We also know that despite those divisions, by and large, most of the things we want to achieve as Europeans are more achievable if we work with the United States and it has to be said, most of the things the United States wants to achieve are more manageable if it works with the European Union."
"I hope we will see that now in Iraq with reconstruction."
"I will be going from this Chamber to Madrid for the Iraq Reconstruction Conference, as will the presidency."
"We will there, I think, see the presidency able to announce a commitment from the European Union for the first year of reconstruction in Iraq which will be larger than the pledge that we were able to make for Afghanistan at Tokyo."
"I think we will be committing over the next months more in Iraq than we did on that occasion."
"We will be committing EUR 200 million from the European budget on top of the EUR 100 million that we have already pledged for humanitarian assistance."
"I think the figure that we are proposing from the budget is a responsible figure: I think it is a serious figure."
"It has not obliged us to use up all our flexibility next year or to take money from other important programmes."
"I think it is far more important for us to be going to Madrid supporting the efforts of reconstruction with a serious contribution rather than a contribution which is merely a political reaction."
"The fourth thing I want to say is that we often talk about effective multilateralism and sometimes we are asked to define it."
"I think what we have seen happen in the last 24 hours in Iran is a good example of effective multilateralism."
"We have embarked on a policy in Iran of tough-minded but constructive engagement. Engagement does not mean abandoning principle."
"We have strong views about the human rights situation in Iraq."
"We have strong views about terrorism."
"We have strong views about nuclear weapons."
"But we have been prepared to hold out a hand of friendship to Iran, recognising that it is a great pre-Islamic civilisation."
"We also recognise – this is certainly my view – that demography in Iran is on the side of democracy, giving Iran the opportunity to be drawn into the international community and not isolated from it."
"So yesterday's visit seems to me to be an excellent example of how much we can achieve in Europe when we work together and I think it is particularly important to recognise that France, Germany and Britain as well as the other Member States have to give a lead in working together."
"I hope that we will see this sort of combined effort more often, using both the resources that can be provided by Member States and the resources that we have agreed to share in common and the competencies that we have agreed to share."
"I hope that we will see that sort of effective cooperation."
"I hope that we will not see too much institutional warfare. I certainly think that the issues that we have to deal with on the international stage are far too serious for that, as is made clear in this excellent report."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow on from Commissioner Patten’s opening remarks in which he thought aloud about such things as Interinstitutional Agreements and political will and underlined their importance."
"Whilst we should, in this House, debate matters in greater depth, I do also think that Interinstitutional Agreements can help to unite political will and enable it to achieve a result."
"This is why the opinion of the Committee on Budgets reflected its particular interest in the question that the President-in-Office of the Council raised at the end of his speech, that of how we handle the European Union’s budget, and of how things stand as regards Parliament’s right to be informed – not as a purely technical question, but because we need these debates on political priorities."
"We can have such debates only if we get at a very early stage all the information in the Council’s possession, which is to be discussed in the Council’s working parties and from which a result is to emerge in the course of many stages, rather than having to wait until the Council has taken its decision and all that remains to be done is to rubber-stamp it."
"I am grateful to you for your undertaking to make these items of information available to Parliament."
"We deal with different partners depending on the matter in hand, and this is an issue on which Parliament and the Commission very often work together."
"In matters of external relations, Parliament, as an institution, always tends to support the Commission in its work, and also tends to be willing to provide more money."
"In the Budget procedure as elsewhere, the Council sometimes slows things down, and so I believe that this is where a new triangular relationship can be achieved."
"You then referred to the subject of the United Nations, and the Commission used to take a very technical approach to this and supported its projects, but there were no policy debates."
"Indeed, the Commission even managed to produce a document on the European Union’s relationship with the United Nations that made no reference whatever to Parliament as the budgetary authority."
"I think that we have now reached a new stage of dialogue with Commissioner Patten."
"In our relations with the United Nations, too, we need to set political priorities, and these need to be discussed by the Council and Parliament in their respective budget procedures."
"That is why this annual report, along with the High Representative’s statements, represents a good step forward."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I think that Mr Brok's report is not so much a report as a manifesto – a manifesto for the shape the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy ought to take, and a manifesto that also touches upon the other major issues faced by the Union, such as delineating its final borders."
"This is a very topical subject, now that, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, with the return of 10 countries into the European fold the Union is being enlarged in a way that was inconceivable and unhoped for just a few years ago."
"Of the many countries that are hoping to join the Union, I would like to highlight here the importance of Ukraine, a country balanced between two worlds, the European world and the Slav world, which it would be in our interest to admit to the European Union."
"I am not just saying that because I have visited that country as a member of a European Parliament delegation."
"The Brok report – as my colleague has just said – provides an excellent assessment of the Council's annual report, which contains nothing more than a simple balance sheet devoid of any in-depth political analysis and scarcely identifies any priorities."
"If, however, in the short time available to me, I may add something, no matter how slight, to the Brok report, then I would like to support the proposal made by Mr Wuori in an amendment that East Africa should be added to the priority areas listed in the report."
"We cannot overlook the important and incisive part played by mediation in the Ethiopian-Eritrean, Somali and Sudanese conflicts, a part which involved enormous sacrifices and difficulties on the part of Italy, whose authority was duly recognised."
"Italy has encouraged the increasing involvement of the European Union in managing such crises, and I believe that it is both right and necessary to include East Africa in the priority areas for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including, specifically, in paragraph 8 of the Brok report."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by extending my group’s congratulations to Mr Brok on his report, which is, as always, very balanced and – like his chairmanship of the committee – very circumspect, while carrying a clear message."
"That is certainly an art, but Mr Brok proves his mastery of it over and over again."
"Today, however, I would like to start in a slightly different way, as I would like to stress that our primary purpose is to promote Europe’s interests, and that this is not in any way something to be concealed."
"The only issue is to what extent our interests coincide with those of others, and how often they are in parallel."
"Particularly in security maters, but also in many other areas, we can see that Europe’s interests parallel those of other regions."
"If we use the security concept that Commissioner Patten has again put before us today – which would be only right and proper – we will see how we are well able to take other regions’ aspirations into account when properly defending our interests."
"One of the things that were discussed and highlighted as long ago as the debate on the presidency was the refugee issue."
"I hope that what was said will be backed up by actions, by which I mean that we will take action in those countries where people feel – or actually are – forced to flee, and help to prevent refugees flooding into Europe to the extent that they do."
"That is in our interests but also in the interests of these people, in that we are giving them the chance of a prosperous life in their own country, from which they will not need to escape."
"To be sure, we need partners in this policy."
"The Americans are, of course, our privileged partners, but we still need to strengthen and develop our relations with other regions such as Russia, China, and India, if we are to cultivate this partnership in an appropriate way."
"This is pre-eminently the case as regards one issue on which our debates will focus during the coming months, and on which Mr Laschet is completing a report, namely reform of the United Nations."
"Anyone who – like our group as a whole – wants the United Nations to come into its own, anyone who fully supports the multilateral approach, must also press for the United Nations to be reformed in such a way as to make it more effective whilst remaining representative."
"All those in this group who opposed the USA’s intervention in Iraq must nevertheless acknowledge that it was also – and I emphasise also – due to the failure by the whole structure of the modern-day United Nations that things got to such a pass, and that we did not make a multilateral attempt at regime change in Iraq at an earlier stage, which would have been the right time to do it."
"Whatever criticisms might be levelled at our own foreign and security policy, we do, as I said earlier, have grounds for pride."
"Reference has been made to Iran."
"Although, institutionally speaking, things could have been better, that was a fine achievement, but it is success that counts, so let us stand by this one."
"I would particularly like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for the policy in the Balkans."
"When we consider what we have achieved in the Balkans in recent years, and how we have managed to bring peace, that is a very positive sign."
"It also means, however, that Europe has to take up its own responsibilities."
"If we are prepared to take up our own responsibilities in our own back yard, then we can achieve success."
"Mr President, today’s good news is that the UN General Assembly has, by a very large majority, adopted a resolution demanding that Israel stop erecting the so-called security wall."
"The resolution even demands that those parts of the wall that have already been built should be torn down."
"Today’s bad news is that, in spite of the UN decision, Israel is continuing to build the wall."
"In the report we are debating, the European Parliament regards the bringing of peace to the Middle East as the most important task to be shared with the United States, together with Russia and the UN."
"We reiterate, moreover, our unqualified support, with which the UN decision is splendidly in keeping, for the implementation of the road map."
"Today, we are also able, together with Commissioner Patten, to be delighted that the hierocracy in Iran is to allow comprehensive inspections and to refrain from producing uranium for use in nuclear weapons."
"The final Iranian acceptance of nuclear inspections followed a visit by the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Great Britain – an international agreement for which the EU can take credit."
"We are today debating a sound report, and that is something for which I should also like to thank Mr Brok."
"It is a very concise report, but not a short one, and I only have a short time in which to mention some of the points I think important."
"The US-NATO relationship is quite fundamental to the European security structure, and we must support the development of reinforced cooperation in the defence area."
"Asia, and China in particular, has not been given as much attention in the report as might perhaps have been wished."
"The increased tensions in relations between China and North Korea is cause for concern, but what is more worrying is, of course, the fact that North Korea will not phase out its nuclear weapons programme."
"We regard this as a considerable threat to stability in Asia."
"The Taiwan issue must also be mentioned in this context."
"In a democratic institution such as this, we must regret the lack of progress on this matter."
"Taiwan is both democratic and peaceful, but the Taiwanese cannot live in the same manner as people in other free, democratic countries, given the way its neighbour is behaving."
"I should like to call for a new dialogue between China and Taiwan and for the EU to do more in pressing for a solution to the conflict."
"– Mr President, there is no doubt that Mr Brok, in his report, has very carefully summarised the opinion of the majority in this House as regards the problem of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"I just have to say something that will surprise nobody, that being that my group is not numbered among that majority."
"I would like to clarify, though, that I do think it necessary for the European Union to really pursue a common foreign policy – in parts, indeed, a foreign policy along Community lines."
"Without one, as the example adduced by Mr Andreasen shows, we will find it difficult or impossible to get the world to give us a hearing."
"I would like to stress that one good thing about this report, in my view, is that it defines as a real alternative a new approach to security and puts the emphasis on multilateralism."
"Its actual tendency, though, does not have the rigour that it needs to distinguish itself from something that I regard as giving cause for concern."
"I would like to highlight two examples. Firstly, I regret the committee’s inability to tackle the problem of the maintenance, defence and further development of the weapons monitoring and disarmament system."
"How are we to put a stop to the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction if our own draft constitution obliges us to build up our own military capacities or potential, the like of which is to be found in no constitution in the world and never has been? We are, in effect, committing ourselves to rearmament instead of setting ourselves targets for disarmament."
"The American attitude towards the control of biological and chemical weapons, the Test Ban Treaty and their threat to withdraw from the Outer Space Treaty make this a very live issue."
"The second problem is that the report explicitly highlights the need to build up military capabilities, despite the European concentration on civil approaches to conflict prevention."
"In Europe, we can currently see positive examples of how conflicts have not escalated into warfare, one example being the Caucasus."
"Why not analyse these experiences and apply them generally?"
"That we are at last making a start on a serious debate about the European Union’s security strategy is something that I very much welcome, but it is lamentable that this debate is still, on the whole, an internal affair in which the general public are not involved."
"I call upon the Council and the Commission to involve Parliament in the debate more than it has been so far, rather than confronting us with ready-made concepts."
"Mr President, according to my group, a crucial element in the Brok report is the realisation that the European Union is, and should be, an important player on the world stage."
"However, if that is what the European Union does, it should do so in a way that is different from the United States."
"The European Union should not try to be a military superpower, but, I would say, a civil superpower."
"These points are hammered home in the report, and rightly."
"Our strengths should lie in diplomacy, trade and conflict prevention."
"These are, and remain, the core elements of common foreign policy."
"And let there be no misunderstanding about this: a military capacity forms part of this."
"The European Union should be capable of doing more than it is doing at the moment, but it should be capable of doing something other than the United States."
"This means, for example, that the first priority should be, as is stated in the report, to build our own rapid intervention force and not to focus on a NATO Rapid Response Force."
"This also means – and on that score I do not see eye to eye with the Commissioner – that more effective spending of what we are paying out on defence at the moment should be Priority Number One."
"I cannot explain to my electors that we need to spend more on defence if they know that current spending is so very inefficient."
"Anyone following the discussion in the media could be forgiven for thinking that the essence of the discussion between the EU and NATO was about headquarters."
"Let us be quite clear about this: it is not about headquarters."
"The United States is frightened that the European Union will develop its own, alternative view, and will come up with an alternative analysis of what security is – an analysis and a strategy that will deviate from those of the United States. I urge you not to be deterred by this resistance from the other side of the ocean."
"The United States does not benefit from having an obedient follower."
"It does, however, benefit from having a confident partner with its own vision."
"This means that parliamentary democratic control should form part of this vision."
"We can talk as much as we like about any vision whatsoever, but, if there is no Parliamentary monitoring in place, and if finances are the only concern from start to finish, then this vision will not become reality."
"Mr President, in my country, you sometimes hear the useful warning never to throw out your old shoes until you have replaced them with new ones."
"This common admonition seems to be very relevant in the case of Europe's security."
"I urge you not to trade NATO for such uncertain military aspirations cherished by a number of EU Member States."
"Meanwhile, this defence ambition on this side of the ocean causes renewed internal European division, as well as fresh transatlantic tension."
"I fully share America's great concern about NATO's cohesion and future, given the autonomous military course taken by President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder."
"The ambivalent ideas about security in Paris and Berlin are entirely reflected in the Brok report: the EU as a complementary security organisation of NATO no less!"
"The Brok report is honest enough to recognise that the EU's current military capacities are inadequate for peace operations."
"In short, I would prefer NATO to look after our security in Europe, and – within the NATO context – to let the EU Member States finally show what they are worth as loyal allies."
"Mr President, following the collapse of Communist dictatorships in the former Eastern bloc, the world has not exactly become a safer place."
"As Samuel Huntington has pointed out, we progressed, after the Cold War, from a bipolar to a multipolar world, and more than ever before, what matters is to identify friend and foe and, hence, also the threats that face us."
"As has rightly been pointed out, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and badly governed states are Europe's three most important threats."
"I should also like to add the demographic pressure of an uncontrollable and encroaching Islam to this list."
"Europe must therefore provide an efficient and well-developed security and defence system."
"This will require political will, as well as investments."
"In that respect, we have to conclude with some sense of shame that the average outgoings for each soldier in Belgium are three times lower than in the other European Member States."
"The Belgian Government has already announced that it will not be increasing the defence budget during this term in office, which has, in fact, only just started."
"It is therefore a sign of some hypocrisy on the part of the Belgian Government if it wants to take the lead in the development of a defence system at European level on the one hand, while refusing to accept the consequences and obligations that this entails."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Brok very warmly for his astute and very balanced report."
"I am glad of one thing that he makes clear in it, namely that it is not enough for us to produce a European security strategy as a constructive response to that of the United States; on the contrary, we must also show how it is to be achieved."
"That is why we need a two-stage plan of the kind proposed in the Brok report, with, as its first step, the formation of a European crisis intervention force for evacuation operations and humanitarian tasks."
"What worries us at present is our relationship with the United States and especially their reaction to these proposals and to those made by the Convention, which has put forward the idea of a mutual defence commitment for the countries of Europe."
"This causes concern to the United States, which take a critical attitude towards it, as they do – vehemently – towards the proposal for enhanced cooperation between a number of European countries."
"Then the proposal was made for a European armaments agency to combine our capacities, and our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic objected to that."
"There is one thing that we have to make clear here: on the one hand, our friends demand that we should develop our capacities and abilities to play a greater global security role and to make our contribution in this area."
"If we want to do that, we have to combine our capacities, and that, after all, is what these proposals are all about."
"We must, then, be clear in our own minds, and make it clear to the Americans, that if we combine our capacities in Europe, that is not being done only for Europe’s benefit, but also for that of the United States."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok for his balanced approach, which has now become legendary."
"His report bears witness to how much the world situation has changed since last year."
"At that time, terrorist attacks were uppermost in our minds, whereas now the focus is on the invasion of Iraq."
"The rapporteur reminds us of the chasms that have been thrown up between the Member States of the European Union, which have severely strained transatlantic relations and which have affected different NATO members to varying degrees."
"Mr Brok believes that it is, however, now necessary to redefine Europe's role and, perhaps, to take advantage of the political crisis sparked by the war to make the Union a credible and powerful political actor on the foreign policy stage."
"Of course, the means of achieving this objective are still relatively ill-defined: some new Member States and their neighbours have, yet again, discovered America and its promises of political and economic guarantees."
"For this reason, it is advisable not to forget Member States' duty to refrain from intervening in international affairs on the basis of unilateral national positions until the European Union has had an opportunity to define a common European position."
"I do not, of course, have time to go into all this in greater depth, but the future of our foreign policy is linked to the European Constitution; the veto can wreck the most ambitious peace plans, as we have heard this morning."
"The European Union's common foreign and security policy objectives depend, not least, on its ability to equip itself with military resources, with the result that we can only envisage relatively low-cost operations."
"Perhaps we shall have to content ourselves with that, even though, ultimately, I do not believe we can."
"The Franco-German Brigade alone, a core Rapid Reaction Force, might well have been enough to stop the Balkan crisis in 1991, as Mr Frattini has also said today."
"We must insist: in addition to the small steps forward achieved …"
"Mr President, the Brok report is well timed in view of fact that the debate on European defence has gained momentum over the past few months."
"What used to fall within the exclusive remit of NATO or was a matter of national sovereignty is increasingly appertaining to the European Union."
"At the end of 2000 in Nice, reinforced cooperation in the area of defence was still kept at bay, but today, there is ever growing consensus in this area."
"EU operations in Bosnia, Macedonia and eastern Africa have shown that Europe has a geopolitical responsibility."
"As the Brok report also clearly indicates, our own European headquarters are a for independent and efficient European defence."
"It appears to me to be of major importance for more Member States, current and future ones, to join the European defence project of Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany and France."
"Only in that way can a European force of this kind put an end to the useless duplication of defence efforts among Member States."
"Only then can we shatter the image of Europe as an economic giant, but a political dwarf and a worm in military terms."
"I am convinced that this is the EU’s big chance to play a positive role in promoting world peace and to give up trying to be a poor man’s United States, with its militarism and philosophy of violence."
"Instead, the EU should develop an alternative non-violent peace policy."
"Unfortunately, the Brok report is permeated by traditional over-confidence in military interventions as the only way of bringing about peace."
"Ought not the EU to learn from the United States’ failures in Afghanistan and Iraq?"
"Ought not the European Parliament to remember its own decisions along different lines, for example the recommendation to the Council, adopted as long ago as 1999, to set up a European civil peace corps?"
"The Council has ignored this recommendation for ten presidencies."
"The European Parliament should also strongly support the promising talks now under way between the Beijing Government and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"It can do this by approving Amendment No 10 which repeats our old demand that the EU appoint a special representative for Tibet."
"Through the people with whom I am in touch as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with the People’s Republic of China and as a member of the European Parliament’s all-party Tibet Group, I have contacts in both quarters."
"I therefore know that both Beijing and the Dalai Lama would welcome a strong initiative from the EU on this issue."
"Mr President, here we have another Brok report, still taking its inspiration from the same principles, still driven by the same desire, which is to construct a common foreign policy."
"Mr Brok still fails to understand that the interests of the various European States differ, that their policies are consequently incompatible and that this common policy, which was established, it should be recalled, more than twelve years ago, under the Maastricht Treaty, is one of the hoariest of old chestnuts to have inspired the European federalist outlook."
"Rarely in history have so many eminent persons written so much and devoted so much energy to achieving this strange and pathological goal, which consists of ensuring that their country no longer exists."
"Most fortunately, however, these pipe dreams remain laughable and have still not been realised to any extent whatsoever."
"Let us focus for a moment on what these dreams are and what is so clearly going on here."
"They reveal an entire blueprint for the world and, I would even say, a genuine fear of the world."
"First of all, Mr Brok, who believes that the Council and the Commission are incapable of setting real priorities, takes it upon himself to perform this task, by deciding on what he calls, in Article 7, the ‘immediate external borders’, in other words the East and the South."
"At the same time, he welcomes the fact that the crisis operations carried out under the common foreign policy have been supported by NATO’s planning and command structure – I am quoting here from Article 30 – and he advocates, of course, closer cooperation with NATO."
"What is the world-view that is being set out here?"
"If the European Union has to implement its principle of ‘Strength through Unity,’ it must do so against the States located in its outermost regions, and closely related to this, must implement this principle, according to Mr Brok, through ever closer relations with the United States in the context of what he calls the ‘Euro-Atlantic Area’."
"To sum up, Europe would be constructed in such a way as to support the unity of the white developed world against everything that is different, everything that surrounds it and everything that it sees as a threat."
"Is this what the common foreign and security policy is, Mr Brok?"
"How then can we expect people to believe that Europe’s goal is to counterbalance US power when its sole aim is clearly to strengthen the unity of the white world against a South that it perceives to be a threat?"
"Can we not see that those singing the praises of the common foreign policy are also the greatest supporters of a wait-and-see policy and that the centre of this Euro-Atlantic area has never been more accurately called ‘the White House’ in other words, a house populated by whites, in league with one another, huddling together happily against the threats posed by the world."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen ..."
"Mr President, the Brok report on the fundamental choices of the CFSP is really extremely interesting and falls short only on one aspect: it fails to state that Europe consists of nations and that these nations, at least the larger ones, fully intend to continue to play their role on the world stage."
"This was demonstrated yesterday by the visit to Teheran by the UK, German and French Ministers for Foreign Affairs, who obtained an agreement to the effect that Iran’s nuclear activities would be brought into line."
"In short, the Brok report views the CFSP too much in terms of constructing a unified entity, whereas it should really be seen in terms of variable geometry and of the synergy of national policies."
"One could make the same reproach, although to a lesser degree, of the draft constitution currently being examined by the IGC."
"This provides for an official who would be responsible for external affairs in the Union, given the highly meaningful title of ‘minister’, supported by European diplomatic activity and wearing not two hats, as has been said, but three: that of High Representative for CFSP, that of Vice-President of the Commission for External Relations and that of President-in-Office of the ‘Foreign Affairs’ Council of Ministers."
"This piling on of responsibilities will cause ...."
"President, this is an excellent attempt by Mr Brok to survey all the controversies and trouble spots of the world."
"The document has positive things to say on the wider Europe debate and new neighbours and, in particular, on the need to acknowledge the potential for full EU membership in future for those neighbours which are clearly European, namely Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus."
"Today I welcome to the Parliament Mrs Timoshenka, a Ukrainian leader of the opposition."
"It emphasises cooperation in the areas of security and defence, which is excellent, only to spoil it, in my view, by regretting the continued unanimity principle and calling for QMV in foreign affairs, which would imperil national sovereignty."
"It rightly calls for strengthened EU and G8 measures again the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which is arguably the biggest threat of all."
"However, I am less convinced of the need for an EU foreign minister or armaments agency and found the mini-defence union proposals of Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Germany purely a piece of post-Gulf war anti-American posturing, which undermines NATO and is laughable without UK military participation."
"I also have concerns about the call for reforms of the UN."
"They are long overdue, but not if this means an EU seat replacing the UK's permanent seat."
"I have longed believed that there is a case to make for India as a permanent Security Council member and, possibly, also Japan and Brazil."
"I welcome the need for closer cooperation with Latin America in general."
"I also have problems with including the ESDP in the Community budget, as defence policy is ultimately a marker of national sovereignty and can mean people dying for their country."
"It should therefore remain under national parliamentary scrutiny."
"Lastly, I have my doubts as to the necessity of a EUROMED Parliamentary Assembly and a EUROMED bank, which will be expensive."
"Besides, most of these countries are not true and fully functioning democracies with properly elected parliaments."
"– Mr President, implementing the EU’s common foreign and security policy will mean having to go from words to deeds."
"The Intergovernmental Conference now going on will have to create structures that will make effective decision-making and action possible."
"Secretary-General of the Council of the European Union, Javier Solana, deserves our support while he frames a strategy on which the Union’s foreign and security policy will be based."
"In a key role here will be the creation of a cordon of properly governed neighbouring countries on the Union’s external borders."
"The Commission proposal on the new neighbourhood policy is currently being debated by Parliament."
"It is a positive sign that future new Member States are actively working on the ‘Wider Europe’ initiative."
"We will need their skills, know-how and views in the development of relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"The proposals for a common foreign and security policy being discussed by the IGC are a logical extension of the decisions reached at the Helsinki Summit on improving the EU’s crisis management capabilities."
"It has to be said, however, that we are still a long way from a situation where the EU could offer its Member States guarantees of military security."
"There is no need to take a negative view of the fact that some Member States are making faster progress in the area of defence cooperation than others."
"At the same time we have to insist that strengthened cooperation should be open to everyone."
"We are in favour of the creation of an international system based on multilateralism, as mentioned in Mr Brok’s report."
"Strengthening the role of the UN will be of key importance here."
"I am pleased that my own Group of the Party of European Socialists has now taken a very special approach to how to improve the way the UN performs."
"Multilateralism also involves maintaining transatlantic relations."
"In the wake of the disagreements over the Iraq war we now must look ahead."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I would like to restrict my observations to our relations with China."
"My group endorses the view put forward by the Commission in its excellent policy paper on the new relationship between the EU and China; we are also very grateful to the Council for having made its position clear as long ago as 13 October."
"Whilst we believe that the People’s Republic of China is a significant strategic partner for the European Union and that both sides should be committed to building up relations between them, we share the Council’s concern that the current human rights situation in China, especially where fundamental civil, cultural and political freedoms are concerned, still does not meet the international standards that China itself acknowledges."
"This is particularly the case as regards Tibet."
"Like the Council, then, we call for serious dialogue to be commenced between central China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"Whilst unequivocally endorsing the ‘one China’ policy, we join with the Council in calling for a constructive dialogue to be commenced between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of China of Taiwan."
"The conflicts across the straits must be resolved by peaceful means, and so the rockets – which could be seen as a threat – must be withdrawn from China’s coastal provinces."
"Parliament’s great interest in having closer relations with Taiwan, including in a multilateral framework, is a matter of record."
"Commissioner, I hope that this Sixth EU-China Summit on 30 October in Peking will be successful in the sense to which the Commission and the Council have referred in their statements."
"Commissioner Patten, I wish you luck in what will be the first high-level meeting between representatives of the EU and China’s new leadership, in the hope that we will be able to make a new start on the basis that we have just discussed."
"All the best!"
"Mr President, this House should not leave unchallenged Mr Coûteaux's comment in this debate about white unity, nor the undoubtedly unintended emphasis on countering terrorism in Islamic states, in paragraph 74 of the resolution."
"Terrorism presents a threat from all states across the world, irrespective of religion."
"Racial prejudice undermines security and should play no part in our security policy."
"Parliament seeks a role to support a stronger and more effective European Union common foreign and security policy, and I congratulate Mr Brok on the strong statements of principle in response to the annual report which he puts before us today."
"There is the need to strengthen transatlantic relations, to build EU defence capabilities in the context of reinforced cooperation between the EU and NATO and clear advocacy of the principle of multilateralism in international relations."
"Today I do not want to concentrate on already well-debated differences of view on issues in the resolution arising from the draft EU Constitution – the powers of the foreign minister, communitarisation, qualified majority voting, the creation of a separate EU defence headquarters or a duplicate solidarity clause for mutual defence."
"But I would stress to all Members that Parliament has already urged Member States to stick as close to the Convention draft as possible, and perhaps that discipline should apply to this House in making further demands now."
"However, I want to argue that, while supporting the wider Europe and new neighbours initiative, this must not be used to diminish Europe's global reach."
"In paragraph 8, is West Africa really more vital to the EU's interests than Central or southern Africa?"
"Cannot European diplomacy be as important in resolving potential nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, as it is – we all dearly hope – in making progress in the Middle East peace process."
"I have never supported the principle of 'not in my back yard'."
"I join with colleagues in criticising those who would retreat from global responsibilities in international relations."
"That must include ensuring the European Union's political support for peace, democracy, human rights and development throughout our interdependent world."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to pay tribute to the work carried out by Mr Brok."
"This report makes many points and puts forward a vision of Europe’s role in international relations that we basically share."
"We also agree with its confirmation of multilateralism and the ranking of Europe’s priorities in foreign policy and even with the positions it adopts on the Middle East."
"If we had the time, I could give you many further examples."
"There is one point, however, that I do wish to address, which is the issue of parliament’s rights in the field of foreign policy."
"Like you, I believe that the European Parliament should be better informed."
"This is stipulated in a recent agreement between the Council, the Commission and our House and it must be fully implemented."
"I do have some reservations, however, about the report’s more extreme demands."
"History has often shown that an effective foreign policy does not sit well with extended parliamentary powers."
"An assembly is a place of debate and discussion and, if necessary, of decision-making."
"Parliamentary time essentially extends over a long period whereas foreign policy must be conducted on a daily basis."
"Incidentally, Parliament is also, sometimes, a place of conflict between groups of necessarily differing opinions."
"I believe, however, that in terms of conducting its external policy, any community would benefit from demonstrating as much unity as possible."
"We also note that, in all democratic countries, the role of national parliaments in foreign policy follows particular rules."
"My last comment is that enhancing parliamentary rights would not make Europe's foreign policy more comprehensible."
"Let us not produce some tangled web of additional competences that would further complicate the European public’s understanding of our actions."
"I shall conclude by saying that, as regards the CFSP, I do not believe it would be a good idea to call for equal rights with the other EU institutions."
"Let us ask questions, let us make recommendations, if necessary, but let us not go so far as to call for the power to deliver opinions on matters of external policy."
"For the CFSP, as for other matters, furthermore, let us rely on the judicious recommendations of the Convention."
"– Mr President, it has been our lot to live through a historical moment which has proved that Europe would benefit from speaking with a single voice and providing itself with common diplomatic and military tools."
"Just as Europe managed to provide itself with institutions capable of embodying its collective destiny, the war in Iraq laid bare the immense distance still to be travelled."
"The introduction in the draft Constitution of a new figure, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union, with one, two or three hats, to borrow the colourful language of Mr Berthu, gives us cause for hope."
"Will this institution do its job?"
"Will it enjoy effective powers?"
"I certainly hope so."
"We cannot accept that European integration will contain two distinct and separate essences: an economic one which embraces integration, and a political one, in the stark, traditional sense, which clashes with it."
"This dichotomy does not really exist and has no part in the nature of European integration."
"If the question were put to them, the citizens of Europe would come out overwhelmingly in favour of common foreign and security policies."
"Legislators at European level, then, run no risk of being accused of taking up position in the vanguard, divorced from public opinion, advancing towards European defence and security."
"The citizens of Europe want to feel secure against the threat of violence, external or internal, but they do not want to be the vassals of any unilateral power, even if it appears in the guise of an ally."
"They may all dream of Immanuel Kant’s plan for perpetual peace, but they know that the road is hard and that, historically, naïve optimism has a high price."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful that the report emphasises the importance of equilibrium and democratic government in our neighbouring regions."
"I would add that it is only the creation of civil society that will form a basis for democracy and security."
"Stability is brought about through the division of state and justice, and that is why it is difficult."
"It is obviously right and proper to underline the importance of the UN’s role in international conflicts."
"High-tech states can attack anywhere – and that has even happened and in even quite a rash way too."
"This way they themselves – or we ourselves – can create crises instead of providing solutions."
"The notion of a closed defence core is strange, puzzling and even frightening."
"What special form of insecurity has come about in those countries whose neighbours are other EU states?"
"In my own country we have not been aware of any security deficit, even though we have a border with Russia more than 1 000 kilometres long and the Russians across that border outnumber the Finns 30 to one."
"Obviously, defence cooperation must be open to all who want it, just as economic and monetary union has been."
"The way we approach international problems has to be in the form of civil crisis management."
"Mr President, I agree with the report’s analysis of the situation following the Iraq war, but not with all the conclusions."
"It is true that new threats and security risks must be combated, above all, by means of political strategies with a view to fighting poverty, protecting human rights and promoting democracy."
"That, in turn, requires efforts to discover conflicts in time and resolve them by political, diplomatic and economic means."
"The EU has these means available to it, and they – and not the military resources – should be increased."
"I do not, however, share the view that the credibility of the EU’s foreign and security policy is dependent upon the EU’s military resources."
"Nor do I support increased cooperation within defence policy, which I believe should be subject to decisions on a unanimous basis."
"Nor am I able to support the proposal that common military operations must be funded via the Community budget and that the EU should, in the long term, acquire its own defence budget."
"Nor can I support the idea of a common military defence of European territory."
"Peace-making operations, as discussed in paragraph 34, are measures in accordance with Article 7 of the UN Charter, that is to say direct military measures, and may only be taken following decisions by the UN Security Council."
"It is the EU’s task to prevent wars, not to make plans for conducting wars."
"Military defence is, and should be, a national issue."
"That is especially important for Sweden and other neutral countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next items are the statements by the Council and the Commission on the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit, including the situation in Chechnya (6 November 2003)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am quite happy to clearly explain the Presidency’s position on relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation, especially as, in a few days, on 28 October, I shall, in fact, be in Moscow, together with the European troika, to examine with Mr Ivanov the prospects for the European Union-Russian Federation Summit planned for Rome on 6 November."
"I should first like to say that the Presidency believes that EU-Russian relations should have strategic importance and that it is therefore in the European Union’s interest to develop these relations into a close partnership: there is now a basis for it in the partnership and cooperation agreement, which was the subject of one of the first joint strategies drawn up by the European Union, and was brought up to date with the St Petersburg Declaration."
"We believe it is in our interest to encourage the reform process begun by the Russian Federation and its move towards closer relations with the European Union."
"This process seems contradictory at times."
"There are probably forces still operating within the Russian Federation which, perhaps furtively – so to speak – oppose this progressive integration of the Federation into European structures; but on the other hand such integration is an objective that President Putin strongly shares."
"This is why we must encourage those who wish to support and promote a closer and more positive relationship with the European Union."
"The St Petersburg Declaration was an important turning-point in our relations with Moscow and marked out a path that the Presidency, with the agreement of the Commission and the support of the Member States, intends to follow: we must give substance to this privileged strategic partner relationship that we intend to have with the Russian Federation."
"The St Petersburg Declaration marked out the path to create four common spaces."
"This approach, which we support, forms a basis for the work to be done at the forthcoming summit on 6 November."
"As regards the common economic space, first and foremost, we are waiting for the high-level working group to conclude its work."
"Commissioner Verheugen will be having a final meeting with his Russian counterpart, the deputy Prime Minister Mr Khristenko, on 28 October."
"We should then reach a final agreement on the actual concept of a common economic space and on operational matters arising from it."
"We hope – and we are working towards this – that we can agree on a common commitment to pursue an even higher level of integration of our economies, through greater liberalisation of trade and greater convergence in terms of regulations."
"In parallel, the European Union is involved in the negotiations for Russia to join the World Trade Organization."
"Talks are at a very advanced stage, although there are still a few problems to resolve: I refer, in particular, to energy prices and access to the services market."
"Commissioner Lamy recently spoke to the Council on this matter and was given strong encouragement to continue with the negotiations."
"We are aware that Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organization is an important, essential condition for a genuine common economic space."
"With regard to the common external security space, we are preparing a draft joint statement setting the criteria, principles and objectives of collaboration in the field of crisis management, which should cover the use of both military resources and civilian resources."
"We hope that through this joint declaration we can spotlight our cooperation in this area of special importance for the Union’s external actions."
"On the common internal security space front, we can report good collaboration, in particular in the fight against organised crime."
"We are on the finishing straight as regards signing the agreement between Europol and the Russian Interior Minister, and we hope to be able to report the event during the 6 November summit."
"Still on the subject of internal security, Russia had asked us to examine a new visa waiver scheme for short visits."
"We are aware that this is a request that can be set in the medium to long term, but a number of preconditions will need to be met first on the Russian side."
"Talks with the Russian authorities on this subject have already started and this is encouraging in any case; a working group has already met, on 13 October, to deal with this matter."
"We attach importance to concluding the negotiations on visas and also those on the readmission agreement: this is a particularly important area, I would say one of the conditions for examining, overall, the Russian request to abolish short-stay visas."
"In the meantime, we hope to be able to report some progress even, as one might say, ‘under current regulations’, without changing the rules."
"Some Member States, including Italy, have already established bilateral agreements, and others have stated their intention to do so."
"The Presidency intends, of course, to work towards a common position that can so far as possible absorb the bilateral agreements."
"Lastly, the common space of culture and education: here we have to work much harder, because very little has been achieved so far."
"Among the positive points I can, however, mention the fact that the Russian Federation has recently joined the so-called ‘Bologna process’, a collaboration mechanism that promotes agreement on academic titles and the harmonisation of university curricula."
"It is an important development."
"I must also mention the possibility of renewing the cooperation agreement in the field of science and technology, and also the prospect of including the Russian Federation in certain Community programmes in the culture and education sector, something that the Italian Presidency is encouraging."
"With regard to the St Petersburg conclusions, there is one aspect on which there is still a difference of opinion: the way the Permanent Partnership Council operates."
"On the Russian side, they continue to interpret the St Petersburg Declaration as meaning that the council should meet not only in different guises depending on the various subjects dealt with, but also in the 25 + 1 format."
"On the European side, the belief is instead that the council should operate mainly according to the troika formula, even if the troika is opened up to other members who may be interested."
"I hope to deal with this matter in greater depth during my visit to Moscow on 28 October."
"In our talks with Moscow, we shall continue to stand by our positions of principle and our concerns regarding the protraction of the Chechnya crisis and respect for human rights."
"The match that is being played out in Chechnya has a significance that extends well beyond that territory: its outcome, whether positive or negative, will be felt throughout the Caucasus and will thus affect the overall security of the continent."
"We have shown the European Union’s support for the broad constitutional reform initiative that President Putin has launched through the adoption of a new Constitution, approved by a vast majority in a popular referendum."
"We have also supported the passing of an amnesty law, which will be important in furthering the reconciliation process."
"In the presidential consultations of 5 October 2003, we saw yet another step in the gradual resumption of normal political and administrative life in Chechnya."
"Today, we reiterate our support for President Putin’s institutional approach and for a political solution that involves those increasingly broad sections of the Chechen population that have no links with terrorism and are therefore entitled to take part in the process of democratic reconstruction."
"In parallel with constitutional reform, in fact, we believe that there is room to improve the current standards of human rights in the region and the relations between the Chechen population and their administrators."
"We shall also reiterate our interest and encouragement for the Russian authorities to achieve the swift and safe release of the representative, Arjan Erkel, who was kidnapped in the Caucasus in August 2002."
"Finally, during the Summit, we intend to underline the urgency for everyone involved, including the European Union and Russia, to redouble their efforts to achieve a solution to the current conflicts in the ex-Soviet sphere: I refer to Transdniestria and the southern Caucasus, in particular Nagorno Karabakh and South Ossetia."
"With the enlargement of the Union and the increasing proximity of our borders, the Union has become rather more sensitive to this than previously, as it directly affects the security of the continent."
"At the same time, we recognise the great responsibility that Moscow has to face and the great contribution it can make in seeking solutions that are satisfactory to all the parties concerned."
"We shall spare no effort or encouragement in this direction."
". Mr President, I am extremely grateful for the Minister's comprehensive and very clear explanation on the prospects for the summit with the Russian Federation."
"It is of course long-standing good practice for Parliament to review our relations with Russia on the occasion of forthcoming summits."
"Parliament may recall that it was briefed at the May part-session before the St Petersburg Summit by my colleague and friend, Commissioner Verheugen, and we are now in the phase of implementing its conclusions."
"We have five major expectations from the Rome Summit, which were alluded to by the presidency."
"First of all, we want to find a common understanding with Russia on the approach to creating the common spaces, stressing the strategic nature of relations between Europe and Russia."
"We should agree on how to do this, for example, by drawing up a joint document, which should contain specific, achievable objectives for the medium term, building on the partnership and cooperation agreement and taking into account the Wider Europe initiative."
"Secondly, we want to intensify discussions on the impact of enlargement."
"It is in Russia’s interest that the partnership and cooperation agreement should be extended smoothly to the acceding Member States, without any discrimination."
"This is a formality, and one on which we want to tie up loose ends by 1 May 2004."
"If we cannot achieve this, we will need to agree to apply the partnership and cooperation agreement on a provisional basis, as in 1997."
"Thirdly, we will take note of reports on the common European economic area and the energy dialogue, to both of which the presidency referred in some detail."
"I spent 18 months myself working with deputy Prime Minister Khristenko on the European economic area."
"We were at what one could call the conceptual stage."
"I hope that will bear fruit by the time of the summit."
"Fourthly, I hope we can reach agreement with Russia on ways to address common challenges."
"This means tackling problems primarily in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs, and the environment."
"We will, for example, request Russia once again to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as possible, and ask Russia to intensify cooperation on nuclear and maritime safety, on terrorism and on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Fifthly, we are ready to agree a joint declaration on cooperation on political and security matters, including crisis management."
"In particular, the European Union expects positive signals from Russia on its readiness to cooperate on the Transdniestrian region of Moldova."
"We are also ready to look at ways to step up cooperation on civil protection, in order to make best use of existing structures."
"Achieving these results – and perhaps I uncharacteristically understate the point – is not without obstacles."
"The presidency has referred to two examples. One in relation to the Permanent Partnership Council and the other in relation to visa requirements and the negotiation of a readmission agreement."
"In making all these points, the European Union will recall the importance of the common values which underpin European Union/Russia relations, and which are crucial with regard to Chechnya."
"The Commission has followed recent developments in Chechnya."
"As Parliament will be aware, we support a political solution to the conflict and we support all genuine efforts to bring about a lasting peace."
"We welcomed the constitutional referendum in March, which we hoped would lead to a peaceful, political settlement to the conflict by providing a platform for genuine dialogue, restoration of the rule of law and the protection of human rights."
"It was in our view essential that the population of Chechnya should recognise the legitimacy of the presidential elections held on 5 October."
"But the conduct of the elections has raised many questions regarding, amongst others, due process and access to the media."
"Also, there are worrying reports of continuing human rights violations."
"Let us be clear."
"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we recognise the territorial integrity of Russia."
"But we also insist on the respect of human rights and the prosecution of those who ignore such rights."
"As the biggest provider of humanitarian aid to the region, the Commission is asking Russia once again to remove all obstacles to the provision of such aid and we are asking for assurances that internally displaced persons will return to Chechnya on a strictly voluntary basis."
"I hope that in putting these points to Russian officials once again we will have a better response than we have had on the many previous occasions when we have raised them."
"In July, Parliament requested the Commission to consider how to support reconciliation and rehabilitation."
"This we are doing, but the most important precondition for assistance – namely security – is simply not met at this time."
"In fact, the security situation in Chechnya has, if anything, deteriorated since last March, and it would be difficult even to carry out a needs assessment, let alone to start work."
"We are fully aware of the conclusions of the September meeting of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and we look forward to a new resolution on EU-Russia relations following the Oostlander report of December 2000."
"Speaking for myself, I hope that by the time I give up my present responsibilities my speaking notes for meetings with my Russian interlocutors do not cover nearly all the same points that they did four years ago."
"– Mr PresidentRussia is already now by far the most significant country the Union shares a border with. That border, which is 1 200 kilometres long, will grow to twice the length when the Union expands into the Baltic countries."
"Russia is still a modest proposition in terms of its economy, GDP being slightly greater than that of the Netherlands, but its economic potential might be said to be huge."
"The Union has already strengthened its cooperation with regard to energy in Russia’s direction, as we heard the Commissioner say, which is vital if we are aiming to find a replacement for North Sea energy sources, which are running out, and avoid becoming solely dependent on the Middle East’s energy resources."
"Russia’s incomparable wealth with regard to forests, however, as well as Siberia’s reserves of precious and colour metals, for example, will also be one of the reasons for Russia’s rise over the coming years, the other being its high achievements in the sciences and high levels of skill and know-how."
"In the view of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Russia is now and will be in the future our most important neighbouring region – whatever geographical definition is applied to cooperation with neighbouring regions."
"In our opinion the Union has to use all the economic and intellectual means it has to try and help the advance of a stable market economy, the development of democracy and see the rule of law become established and take root in Russia, because any other sort of Russia, if it remains a nuclear superpower, would also be the greatest potential security threat to the Union."
"Russia and the rest of Europe are bound to one another by destiny."
"‘There is no great Europe without Russia and no great Russia without Europe’ was the motto employed by our party, led by the current President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, and Russia’s workgroup on progressive forces back at the start of the 1990s."
"Our attempts at cooperation with Russia, however, must not be allowed to eclipse the fact that we now insist on better compliance with human rights and the freedom of speech than before in Russia."
"This does not apply just to Chechnya, but also and above all to the Chechnya region and the war and destruction in Chechnya that continues still."
"No conflict is any longer solved with weapons, but political decisions instead."
"The United States of America can also see that in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"That is why we demand that Russia shows even greater political initiative and openness and that it should make considerably better use of international organisations in more open solutions to the problems of Chechnya, as Commissioner Patten also said here in his speech with regard to questions of security in the region."
"Mr President-in-Office, we are not convinced that the recent elections and referenda were conducted honestly."
"Apparent democracy has been produced to cover up the truth, not to reveal it."
"In my opinion, the Council’s impression of a positive development, which Mr Frattini suggested there was, is not absolutely in keeping with the truth, and we noticed there were slight but obvious differences in the positions presented here by Commissioner Patten on the one hand and the President-in-Office on the other."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, relations between the European Union and Russia have improved, but not enough."
"It is worth remembering that almost 40% of Russia’s exports come to the European Union."
"Just 6% go to the United States of America."
"Now it is estimated that after enlargement that figure will rise to 60%."
"At the same time, the Union’s dependence on Russia’s resources is growing: that would seem the prospect for natural gas, for example, in the next decade."
"It is in Russia too that economic growth these days is fastest in the world."
"The Russian President has set two objectives in his election campaign: firstly, to create a strong central power based on the rule of law, and secondly to extend economic growth to the vast sections of Russia’s population who are poor."
"It is in the European Union’s interests that Russia is able to solve its huge problems, from its wide-scale poverty to human rights, freedom of the media and the war in Chechnya."
"We want to see that economic, political and cultural cooperation can also help us to have an impact on Russia’s problems."
"We have also had a taste of Russian isolation."
"In its time it was a gift to Stalin, who pulled down the shutters and began having his own people killed."
"Now it is important that civil society in Russia, now in its infancy, has our support."
"This is precisely what many Russians are hoping to obtain from us."
"Let us not leave them just to get on with it!"
"The Russian leadership claims they often listen to the messages coming from the Union more carefully than they do each other."
"These aims will serve to allow Russia to join the World Trade Organisation as soon as possible."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement should be reviewed to correspond with today’s needs."
"Regarding Chechnya, I would say that the elections were problematic, as previous ones have also been, and the Community has been unable to accept them."
"We propose that there should be an international conference and arbitration with regard to this matter and also that relief organisations should be allowed access to the region promptly."
"– Mr President, the biggest single project between the EU and Russia is the creation of a common European economic area."
"It has been hard making that a reality, as it has been a matter of a bilateral project between the EU and Russia."
"At the same time both sides have been developing relations of cooperation with other states."
"Thus, Russia has recently concluded an agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan on the formation of a common economic area."
"The EU has its own separately agreed arrangements with these countries."
"In my opinion it would be wise to try and bring together these arrangements for cooperation by establishing a broader, multilateral, economic area of cooperation, with the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also that of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as well as any other of the Newly Industrialised Countries willing to participate."
"Where appropriate the European Economic Area, which was established between the EU and EFTA, could be taken as a model."
"An arrangement agreed along such lines would be well suited to the EU’s evolving broader European policy."
"The EU’s new, broader European policy also offers opportunities for the development of cross-border cooperation where the EU shares a border with Russia."
"The Commission proposal for a new financial instrument for neighbourly cooperation will eliminate those problems which we have had harmonising internal and external financial schemes."
"The Russian authorities must familiarise themselves with the new financing scheme in good time so that we can be sure it will work right from the start."
"Finally, my greetings go to the Russian Government."
"Can you ensure that human rights are implemented in Chechnya and do your very best to seek a peaceful solution to this region’s problems!"
"Mr President, this is somewhat earlier than expected, for which I am grateful to you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my gratitude but also my disappointment in respect of the Italian Presidency."
"My gratitude is for the fact that the Foreign Affairs Minister has mentioned the name of Arjan Erkel without prompting."
"He clearly stated that he will urge the Russians to take additional steps to bring about the release of Mr Erkel, a humanitarian aid worker who has disappeared, having been abducted over a year ago."
"This is a message of hope, Mr Frattini; his relatives are pleased about it, and so is the organisation ‘Médecins sans Frontières’."
"I hope that you will certainly bring this up for discussion on 28 October in your meetings with Mr Ivanov."
"I have, however, to give voice to some disappointment too, Mr Berlusconi."
"This is a statement by the Council and the Commission."
"I have listened very carefully to Mr Patten, who made very pertinent statements about the situation in Chechnya and about the elections in that country."
"Mr Frattini, you only stated – and I made a note of it – that you will express your concern about the human rights situation in Chechnya."
"The issues involved are much worse, though."
"As Mr Patten quite categorically stated, those elections were not real elections."
"They were a sham, a farce."
"Those elections were not conducted in accordance with international standards, and the hope we shared with our ad hoc delegation when we returned, when we saw that a political process had indeed been put in motion, has now all but evaporated."
"Peace will not return to Chechnya unless all factions, all clans, within the Chechen population are involved in a real peace process, in a real dialogue."
"Peace will not return to Chechnya unless the Russian Government is prepared to talk and enter into dialogue with the rebels, the freedom fighters."
"This is why I want to come back to our resolution of July, in which the express request was made for the European Union to play a significant role, with a peace conference held under its aegis, because an external player is required to ensure that the Russians and Chechens enter into real dialogue."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you for the extra time you have given me."
"Mr President, close cooperation with Russia is vital if the international community is to compel Iran to restrict the application of nuclear energy to purely civil purposes."
"I trust that the Council and the Commission will clearly put this message across to President Putin."
"After all, what matters now is for yesterday's concessions to Iran to be realised."
"In this context, I should also like to touch upon a complaint made by President Putin."
"According to him, Russian companies have had sanctions imposed on them for supplying the nuclear sector in Iran."
"However, according to Putin's sources, European and American companies got off scot-free having made identical transactions."
"I would like to ask the Council and the Commission if this serious allegation concerning Europe's contribution is true."
"I should like to offer the Council and Commission a second, equally urgent item for the Summit's agenda."
"In the Gulf of Kerch, a serious border conflict between the Ukraine and Russia is at risk of escalating out of control."
"The immediate cause is the construction of a dam from the Russian peninsula Taman to the Ukrainian island of Tuzla in the Gulf of Kerch."
"We from the European side should make an urgent appeal to both parties for a peaceful settlement of this thorny territorial dispute."
"I also concur with what Mr Staes said in connection with the request that Europe should do everything possible in connection with what has happened to Arjan Erkel."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am sorry, but the policy you both stand for today is no longer just a vile and irresponsible policy: it is a criminal policy, because what you are doing, Mr President-in-Office, is criminalising an entire people."
"You have presented them as a terrorist people; the foreign ministers of the five largest countries in the European Union, who met in Paris last week, promised each other to exchange information on the international terrorist training camps in Chechnya."
"You have never given us – the public – the slightest evidence of them."
"You talked of Chechen terrorists present in Afghanistan, but no Chechen has ever been found in Afghanistan; you said the same thing about Iraq, but you have never found a single Chechen in Iraq, alive or dead."
"This is an identical operation to the one that was carried out in the 1930s, when a whole people was presented as a people of plutocrats; well, now, day after day, you present the Chechen people to European and world public opinion as a terrorist people."
"You do so because it is expedient for you to do so; it is expedient for you to do so because of the policy you are developing with British Petroleum, which is of great interest to Mr Blair; with Shell, which is of great interest to Mr Oostlander; with , which is of great interest to President Prodi or Mr Berlusconi; with , which is of great interest to President Chirac; and with other companies too, of course."
"That is what you are doing, in order to promote a policy of self-interest, and certainly not a policy of truth."
"I wish to begin by saying that our relationship with Russia is incredibly important."
"I wish I had much more time to talk about it, but I want to concentrate upon what is most urgent, namely the issue of Chechnya."
"It is a quite specific conflict, but there are nonetheless many parallels."
"We see in many quarters how great powers come into conflict with population groups with different national identities."
"It is, of course, easy to say that this or that should be done, but I think there is a pattern to learn from."
"We can begin by looking at ourselves – the EU and Europe."
"Historically, we have a lot of experience of conflicts of this type."
"One current example is Northern Ireland, where we are beginning to find a solution."
"Another example is the Basque Country."
"No Europeans now imagine any longer that the conflicts in the Basque Country and Northern Ireland can be resolved by military means."
"Political solutions have to be sought."
"Formulas have to be found that are acceptable to both parties, and that naturally also applies to Russia in Chechnya."
"That is something we have to do all in our power to emphasise."
"Peaceful solutions must be sought, and they must be based upon respect for self-determination on the part of the people concerned."
"How, in practical terms, the particular conflict is then to be resolved is something the parties must discuss and agree about."
"No one else can solve the conflict for them."
"The point of departure must, however, be self-determination on the part of the people."
"Democracy must have grass roots support, rather than be imposed from above."
"It is not possible for Moscow to dictate solutions."
"If the Russian people do not realise this, a lot of damage will be done both to Russia and to future cooperation between Russia and the EU."
"Mr President, we have already discussed Chechnya on a number of occasions in this House, and it is important to mention this."
"At the same time, I should like to underline how right the two-track policy is with regard to Russia. After all, we are dealing with entirely different cooperation possibilities, which may, in turn, have an effect on Russia's political culture."
"It is precisely in this political culture of Russia that Chechnya fits in as an area where indeed, a failed state was created at one time – a kind of black hole in the Russian federation, where Russia had no choice but to act."
"The way in which this is done, however, fills us with disgust."
"We should consider whether it would not be possible for us – maybe in the person of Mr Solana – to criticise Russia's military intervention in that country to such a degree that Russia would feel forced to change its strategy."
"The military training, the system of that military apparatus and the strategy used in Chechnya all fit into the old pattern of ruling with a rod of iron."
"This only breeds terrorism and results in desperate suicide acts."
"These are events that we have witnessed from relatively close-by in Chechnya."
"If we ask the acting commanding officer whether there is an alternative to this guerrilla warfare and whether there is any knowledge about this alternative method, his response is that this knowledge is available at the ministry, but he questions what good that is to them on the ground."
"This shows that the Russians cannot appreciate why we in Europe make such a fuss about Chechnya."
"Despite this, it is extremely important for us to keep an eye on this aspect, because one of the areas that has been mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council, namely that of internal security, is, of course, directly connected to it."
"We must not, therefore, forget Chechnya."
"I share the view of the others who say: Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with all due respect for you when you draw attention to the case of Arjan Erkel – in respect of whom it would be fantastic if you were able to solve it during your presidency – but you have to remember that Chechnya is more tragic than you have depicted it."
"Mr Patten is right: the security situation over there is abominable; even aid workers will certainly not be able to operate in safety."
"That is why it is of vital importance that we pull out all the stops to see whether we can persuade the military, and hence the politicians, in Russia, to change the way it behaves in Chechnya."
"– Mr President, in the past, the European Union has, in matters relating to Chechnya, addressed most of its appeals for a peaceful resolution of the conflict to Russia rather than to both sides."
"It was only when the USA became the victim of targeted terror attacks, which Europe also feared, that we began to take a more nuanced view of the situation."
"Such a realistic approach is to be welcomed, and the summit with Russia should reinforce it."
"It seems to me, Commissioner, that the European Union will not always be able to exclude the issue of the CIS from the debate it wants on the European Common Area, but will have to face up to it."
"Even if one takes a critical view of the possibilities open to it in political dialogue on the resolution of the conflict with and within Russia in relation to Chechnya, the EU does have options, and we should make use of them primarily in order to provide effective aid for humanitarian purposes and for reconstruction, so that the hard-pressed people of Chechnya can get real help."
"Mr President, the summit on 6 November will be different because not only is Russia currently the EU's fifth largest trading partner, but from next May it will be its neighbour."
"Already the acceding countries are flexing their muscles, as illustrated by Lithuania's concerns over the controversial D-6 oilfield in the Baltic Sea, and Latvia's objections to harsh criticism over its treatment of its Russian minorities, who will number almost one million between the Baltic republics in the EU next year."
"The EU will shortly be importing Russian uranium."
"Plans are afoot to synchronise the two electricity grids."
"Pressure is mounting on Russian to ratify Kyoto, as otherwise the treaty is dead."
"In exchange, Russia will want EU support in its quest to join WTO, where there are many unresolved problems, from its dual pricing over gas to export duties and discriminatory transport fees paid to Aeroflot to overfly Siberia."
"Recently, the issue of pricing Russian oil in euros was raised."
"Surely this is for the markets to decide, not governments."
"I welcome formal cooperation with Europol and OLAF and hope that visa-free travel for Russians will be possible once the issue of a readmission agreement for illegal migrants is settled."
"We are used to the abuses levelled at President Putin over Chechnya, where the recent victory of President Kadyrov was described as lacking in pluralism, and human rights abuses still go on."
"But what do the Russia-bashers want?"
"A failed, rogue, independent state in the Caucasus with links to Al Qaeda, exporting organised crime to the European Union?"
"First we must see law and order restored."
"Only then can true democracy prevail."
"Only Russia can deliver that."
"Recently, Russia signed a controversial and, in my view, regrettable single economic space agreement with Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but at the same time we now see dangerous military posturing from Russia and threats to invade as a result of the dispute over Tuzla Island in the Black Sea."
"I hope that this can be resolved amicably."
"I hope that one day we will see arrangements for a single free-market-style economic space with the EU and Russia united as one big economic entity."
"– Mr President, I was shocked by what Mr Frattini had to say about Chechnya."
"In making these statements, you are putting yourself at odds with what the majority in this House has thought and said for years, and also opposing the position that the majority in my party, the European People’s Party, has taken for years in this House."
"We have stood up for freedom and human rights in Chechnya, where Russia is engaged in a brutal colonial war, the second stage of which was inaugurated by President Putin in the course of the bloodiest election campaign in history."
"Mr Putin is, unfortunately, not going to solve the problem, for he is a quite substantial part of it."
"On attempting to consider the problem from the point of view of Russia’s interests, one discovers relatively quickly that Russia’s interests and Chechnya’s are in fact one and the same."
"Russia is suffering from financial problems; in Chechnya, billions are being senselessly squandered on a futile and bloody war."
"In Russia, democracy and the rule of law are suffering decline and – as Andrei Sakharov’s widow Yelena Bonner, has very powerfully described – the war in Chechnya is being taken as an opportunity for old structures to re-establish themselves."
"Russia is suffering to a quite substantial degree from remilitarisation and the return of elements from the secret services, developments that also essentially derive from Chechnya and the war that is being waged there."
"Russia is suffering from terrorism and from organised crime."
"As Mr Oostlander so rightly said, the war in Chechnya is doing nothing to remove these problems, but is making matters worse."
"It can therefore be said that those who commit themselves to freedom in Chechnya and to its liberation are ultimately also committing themselves to freedom and liberation for Russia."
"In the long term, Russia will have to recognise that the only solution for its problems is for Chechnya to be a real democracy, and we have to see that the problem is that the pseudo-referendum that has been held there is intended to legitimise someone who was and is a villain rather than a legitimate partner in dialogue, namely President Mashadov."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a look at the topics for the forthcoming summit with Russia reveals among them such important and honourable projects as support for independent media at national, regional and local level, the integration of Russia into a common European economic and social area, cooperation in the fight against international crime and illegal migration, cooperation in the field of nuclear safety, the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and a number of other things."
"I recall, in this context, an article by the Russian chess grand master Garry Kasparov on the eve of President Putin’s visit to the USA, an article that is equally relevant to the imminent summit between Russia and Europe."
"Its opening line went something like this: ‘Vladimir Putin comes to the USA as a great friend of democracy, of the rule of law, and of human rights."
"True?’, whereupon Kasparov promptly answered the rhetorical question with a polemical ‘No, false!’."
"He followed this up with a veritable tirade enumerating incidences of negligence and wrongdoing, arguing, for example, that Russian democracy is only a front; that the press and media are in fact made to toe the line, that liberalisation of the economy is not in fact being implemented, that potential contenders in the forthcoming presidential elections were interned on spurious charges of economic crime, and that the elections in Chechnya were a charade."
"I have no wish to promote Mr Kasparov from chess grand master to being the yardstick by which we judge everything, but, even if one regards it as exaggerated – which was his intention – his article has to make us prick our ears up."
"We must not blot out unpleasant issues."
"Chechnya is a running sore and the grossly manipulated elections did nothing to heal it."
"What, then, should we be calling for?"
"We should be calling, firstly, for an end to the lawlessness of Russian army personnel, or else it will never be possible to win the public’s confidence."
"Secondly, democracy must be put on a broad basis."
"It would be desirable if the Kremlin were, at the EU-Russia summit, to be reminded, on this point, of its most fundamental responsibility, for it is in any case President Putin who is required by the Russian constitution to guarantee human rights in the Russian Federation as a whole."
". – Mr President, I thank all the Members who have spoken and expressed opinions – some of which I think deserve brief comments – as well as claims with which I frankly cannot agree."
"First, as Mr Patten has already said – I had mentioned that the Council’s activities and the Commission’s have always moved along in parallel and in complete understanding – doubts have already been expressed regarding certain moments in the presidential elections in Chechnya, and our Russian friends have also been told quite clearly on a number of occasions that Europe is keeping a close watch on the situation inside Chechnya and on the human rights situation."
"At the same time, I think it is quite right – and the Presidency confirms this – to have continued to encourage the constitutional reform approach that President Putin has embarked on and which he confirms and maintains."
"At no time in my speech, which is, moreover, available for everyone to look at – as in fact I only heard in one speech by a Member – at no time did I ever say anything that could be taken to mean that I considered the whole Chechen people to be terrorists."
"I said the opposite: I said quite specifically that the Presidency hopes and desires that those increasingly numerous and widespread sections of the Chechen people that have no connection with terrorism should be involved in the constitutional process."
"I repeat: I do not believe in any way at all that the Chechen people is a terrorist people."
"Nevertheless, although we shall certainly talk about this point – that is, the involvement of a broad spectrum of Chechen civil society in the constitutional process – at the summit with the Russian Federation, I must also make it just as clear that there can never be any justification of any kind for those individuals – however many of them there may be – who commit terrorist acts or use themselves as human bombs to kill innocent civilians."
"On this point, we Europeans have always been and, I hope, will continue to be united."
"That concludes the debate."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the initiative in the United Nations for a universal moratorium on the death penalty."
". – Mr President, on 10 October 2003, the World Day Against the Death Penalty, I adopted a public declaration on behalf of the European Union which clearly stated: ‘The European Union calls upon countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty to at least introduce a moratorium as a first step towards complete abolition.’"
"This, I repeat, is the declaration that I myself adopted just a few days ago on behalf of the European Union: a text agreed upon by everybody."
"I say this because even before that, as a representative of the Italian Government, I can say that Italy has always been firmly convinced that the battle for the abolition of the death penalty is of great political and idealistic value, as well as having a very important humanitarian aspect."
"I believe that all of us Europeans are sure that the process leading to the complete abolition of the death penalty is irreversible, but also that this process has to be a gradual one."
"That is why we must ask ourselves how we should act in practical terms so that the sacrifice of human life that it inevitably requires can be stopped for good."
"These are the concerns that have led the Italian Presidency to accept the invitation of this House and many other parliaments, including the one in my country, to propose to the governments of the countries of Europe a European Union resolution initiative on a moratorium, to be put before the current United Nations General Assembly in New York."
"Mr Berlusconi spoke in the same vein here in Parliament on 2 July this year; this commitment is founded on concerns that we all share, as reflected in the report and resolution on human rights in the world, adopted by the European Parliament on 4 September."
"In the debate within the European Union, a major ethical problem, which is a question, has arisen."
"People have wondered: Is pursuing the complete abolition of the death penalty compatible – I repeat, is it compatible – with an initiative such as the moratorium, which is based on governments’ willingness not to apply the death penalty in practice in their countries?"
"There are also more strictly political considerations."
"Is there, people have wondered, a sufficient level of agreement for the resolution to be adopted in the General Assembly?"
"How much might a possible defeat affect the future of the campaign for the total abolition of the death penalty?"
"If the data really confirm that there is a trend towards an expansion of the abolitionist front, we wonder: is it now worth running the risk of the resolution failing – given the uncertainty of the outcome – or might it not be better to wait until our position has been further consolidated?"
"These are the questions that have been asked."
"The Italian Presidency has been giving considerable thought to these serious questions, because Europe obviously cannot and must not appear divided or uncertain on a subject as important and sensitive as this one."
"We have weighed up the pros and cons."
"We have mobilised our whole diplomatic network to try to understand, to get an idea – so to speak – of voting intentions on a possible resolution for a moratorium."
"The result of this survey, which we have carried out in all the diplomatic offices, seems to indicate that a suitably formulated text might be approved by the General Assembly, although, of course, that is not a certainty."
"The fact remains, however, that many countries whose history would suggest that they should be in favour of a resolution of this sort have not expressed their position on our question, and we should not ignore the risk that, if amendments are tabled on the text of a resolution such as this, the united front of supporting countries might suffer some major defections when it comes to the vote."
"The Italian Presidency – and the Italian Government, at a national level – are very conscious of the demand made by this Parliament, the European Parliament, just as, in Italy, we are conscious of the mission that the Italian Parliament has given us to put a resolution on a moratorium before the General Assembly."
"On the other hand, it is quite clear to us that many governments within the European Union are still rather baffled and are wondering how best to pursue this objective, which we all share."
"We are convinced that a European initiative to put a resolution before the General Assembly would be politically well-timed and morally very worthwhile, and we have been and still are working towards this, so that the question can remain a subject for examination and careful consideration by the foreign ministers."
"We are aware that concern over a defeat, despite the general positive feeling, is prevailing over any inclination to table a resolution."
"We, as the Italian Government, uphold this commitment at a national level, but, as the holder of the European Presidency, Italy still hopes that the outcome of this careful consideration will be a European decision to go ahead with tabling the resolution."
"This would be a decision consistent with Europe’s commitment to oppose the death penalty."
"That is why I am once again calling for some careful consideration."
"I know time is short, and I know this consideration has to lead to a decision very swiftly."
"I hope there will be either a joint decision of all the countries of Europe to share responsibility for tabling a resolution of this kind – which would be by far the best option – or a European decision that clearly leaves the path clear for national initiatives on this subject by European countries, including, perhaps, the Italian Government acting at a national level."
"If the initiative comes from Europe, it will certainly have greater force; if it comes from the governments of European countries it will certainly have less force but it will be equally important."
"I am still waiting for the representatives of the European Governments – and I shall be giving them a reminder – to give me their judgment and final opinion on one or other of these possible solutions within a very short time."
"Mr Patten, this is not the first time you have addressed the House on this issue."
". Mr President, you are entirely correct in saying that I have addressed Parliament on a number of previous occasions on the death penalty and I have had to observe occasionally in the past that when I first used to make speeches in a Parliament on the death penalty, I did not find such unanimity of support for my views."
"I remember voting for the abolition of capital punishment in various parts of the British Isles, not always with great support."
"The first act that I carried out when I was a colonial oppressor was to abolish capital punishment in Hong Kong!"
"So I have a certain amount of 'form' on this issue, as football managers would say."
"Can I straightaway apologise for the fact that I will not be able to stay for the whole of this debate."
"I have to catch an aeroplane for Madrid for the Iraq Donors' Conference which is beginning tomorrow morning, and where, of course, the presidency will also be represented."
"I hope Parliament will excuse me of any discourtesy, but my colleague, Mr Fischler, will be coming to sit here to report anything that I should have heard later in the debate."
"I hope also that Parliament will excuse me if a good deal of what I say treads in the elegant footsteps of the presidency."
"I want to put many of the same points, but in my own way."
"Parliament knows that we consistently work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"In the process of attaining this objective, where the death penalty still exists, we call for its use to be progressively restricted, we insist that it should be carried out with the minimum cruelty."
"The European Union also presses, where relevant, for moratoria to be introduced."
"We have produced internal guidelines for démarches and representations on capital punishment, where relevant, in multilateral fora and towards third countries."
"At the European summit with China last year, the then Prime Minister of China, Zhu Rongii, said: 'you just talk about these issues to poorer countries don't you?'"
"I pointed out to him that the first time I recalled us raising the issue was with the United States."
"So it is an issue that we raise –I must say that the United States Secretary of State was slightly surprised! – with everyone."
"The European Parliament is a long-standing opponent of the death penalty and has been instrumental in promoting this process."
"Parliament has declared in the past that it considers capital punishment, and I quote, 'an inhuman, medieval form of punishment, unworthy of modern societies'."
"A series of initiatives have been taken to ensure that the abolition of the death penalty should become a key element of European human rights policy."
"It is on the basis of this strongly held European policy objective that for the last years we have successfully tabled resolutions in the UN Commission on Human Rights on the death penalty, as the President-in-Office has said."
"The seventh consecutive resolution was adopted in Geneva on 24 April."
"This resolution contains some significant new features."
"It calls, in particular, on states not to carry out executions in public or in any other degrading manner and to ensure that any application of particularly cruel or inhuman means of execution, such as stoning, be stopped immediately."
"While the support for resolutions on the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights has increased, it has to be said that opposition has increased as well."
"The resolution adopted in Geneva received the support of 24 states, while 18 voted against and 10 abstained."
"However, the strong disagreement of many states was proved by the fact that 63 countries signed a statement dissociating themselves from the resolution."
"I thought it would be useful to recall these facts in the context of today's debate on a resolution requesting a moratorium on the death penalty in the General Assembly Third Committee."
"A first consideration, before presenting any resolution, should be whether such a text would receive sufficient support to be adopted by the General Assembly."
"We all remember the 54th session of the General Assembly in 1999."
"A text notably calling for the establishment of moratoria and the enforcement of certain safeguards was circulated."
"This draft caused an immediate outcry from states that maintain the death penalty, including Egypt, India and Singapore."
"Strong attacks were made on the European initiative, and we were perceived as seeking to impose our values on other sovereign states. In the end, the text was withdrawn."
"That was the situation in 1999."
"We have no indications that the General Assembly would be more positively inclined today towards a death penalty resolution."
"It would seem that while the hard-line retentionists are resigned to further Commission on Human Rights texts on this issue, they will continue to resist strongly any efforts to secure a General Assembly resolution."
"This would lead to further divisive debate."
"As a result, the European Union has decided to pursue its action against the death penalty in the Commission on Human Rights rather than the General Assembly."
"However, a more fundamental issue is whether a resolution asking for a moratorium would promote the European objective of abolition of the death penalty world-wide."
"The presidency has suggested that the European proposal should not go as far as requesting abolition of the death penalty but rather a moratorium on the use of this punishment."
"Since the resolution tabled by the European Union in the Commission on Human Rights asks states to abolish the death penalty completely and, in the meantime, to establish a moratorium on executions, we may run the risk of being perceived as weakening the European stance by not suggesting the same high standards in the General Assembly."
"I should also let you know that I have been approached by non-governmental organisations on this matter."
"In July of this year, I had the pleasure of convening a special seminar for human rights NGOs in Brussels."
"In the context of that meeting, the world coalition of NGOs against the death penalty, and that includes Amnesty International and many other prestigious organisations, presented its own view."
"The message of this group was to ask the European Union to refrain from presenting a resolution on the death penalty at the forthcoming General Assembly."
"These NGOs in particular pointed out that since there are no signs to the effect that political tensions have eased since 1999, such an initiative could create a highly politicised and counter-productive debate in the General Assembly."
"In their view, another failure in the General Assembly could reinforce the position of those states that maintain the death penalty."
"I attach great importance to the expertise of the many renowned NGOs that we work with."
"They also play an important role as partners in the framework of projects we implement under the European initiative for democracy and human rights programme."
"On the initiative of this NGO coalition, we also for the first time on 10 October celebrated, if that is the right word, the World Day Against the Death Penalty."
"The European Commission will continue to support campaigns designed to achieve a moratorium on the death penalty and on executions and eventually the abolition of capital punishment throughout the world."
"Last year approximately EUR 4.9 million were allocated under the European initiative to projects aimed at raising European public awareness in retentionist countries."
"The methods used include public education, out-reach to influence public opinion, studies on how states' death penalty systems comply with minimum standards, informing and supporting strategies for replacing the death penalty and efforts towards securing the access of death row inmates to appropriate levels of legal support, as well as training for lawyers."
"During the last months there have also been some positive developments that should be highlighted."
"In January, Governor Ryan of Illinois decided to commute the death sentences of 156 prisoners on death row."
"Through the entry into force on 1 July of Protocol 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the use of the death penalty is banned not only in peacetime but also in time of war."
"Lastly, the President of Armenia in July commuted all outstanding death sentences to life in prison and, subsequently, in September, ratified Protocol 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, and in that way abolished the death penalty."
"Let me repeat, we take this issue seriously, and I am delighted that we are working with a presidency which has taken it so seriously and has pursued it with considerable skill and very good political judgment."
"We are making some progress, but it will take time and persistence, as well as the continuing advocacy of this Parliament if we are to attain our goal, which is to see the death penalty consigned to the history books as a form of punishment that should have no place in the modern world."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, thank you for describing the efforts you are currently making."
"The European Union’s position is indeed clear; we are all unreservedly opposed to the death penalty, and that is why the resolution tabled jointly by this House is a relatively short one."
"The fundamental and primary question is what tactics we should adopt in order to make the best progress."
"Are we to address the UN Commission on Human Rights and demand its abolition there, or are we, in the UN General Assembly, to call only for a moratorium?"
"Commissioner Patten set out very well how we can proceed without losing sight of our fundamental rejection of the death penalty."
"One might almost say that it is a bit warped: the best solution is of course the abolition of the death penalty; the second best is a moratorium; the worst of all the bad solutions is for there to be still such things as stoning to death or other even crueller modes of execution, and the second worst is to demand that people be executed ‘humanely’."
"So discussion of this amounts to something almost perverse."
"I do believe, though, that the approach that Parliament is asking the Council to take will end up being feasible, involving as it does the European Union presenting a united front in calling, in the General Assembly, for a moratorium on the death penalty."
"I believe that all the states belonging to the United Nations know where the European Union stands on this."
"Calling now only for a moratorium will not mean that we lose sight of the overall objective."
"I also think it would be right for this motion to be put by the European Union as a whole."
"I do not think it would be right for one or other government to obstruct it and thus prevent action by the EU as a whole."
"Still on this subject, I would be interested to know what line our candidates for accession take on this issue."
"As a general rule, this should already include them."
"I believe that an initiative of this kind carries more weight and has more far-reaching impact if twenty-five states adopt it."
"As our resolution indeed mentions, the individual Member States also need, in so far as they are able, to attempt to make approaches to individual states and persuade them to support at least a moratorium."
"I believe that would be the best way for us to proceed."
"I wish the Presidency all the best for its negotiations towards this end."
"I am sure that this House will, by way of this resolution, virtually unanimously endorse this approach."
"– Mr President, may I say by way of an introduction that it is rather odd that every debate of ours on the death penalty should still be marred by a particular lack of frankness."
"A few months ago we listened with similar discomfort to people speaking in tones of exasperation about Cuba, while on China, with its 3 138 executions in one year, we continue to pick just polite words, which are reduced at times to an embarrassed stammer when Europe is called to speak out on the increasingly frequent, at times almost industrial use of capital punishment in the United States or other so-called liberal democracies that still use the gallows, such as Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and India."
"I should not like this political bashfulness to be compounded now by a serious omission concerning a commitment that the Presidency of the Council formally adopted before this Parliament on 2 July this year, that is, to put a resolution for a moratorium on capital punishment before the United Nations General Assembly."
"Let us recall – and let us remind Minister Frattini of this – that this resolution was given as one of the Italian Presidency’s priorities in its foreign policy programme, and we know – as a matter of common sense and also from experience – that a moratorium is the first political step towards the abolition of the death penalty; anything else is just a pipe-dream."
"The deadline for submitting a text for this resolution is 7 November, but so far there is no sign of the resolution."
"After many decades of noisy and sometimes sterile debate, it would be irresponsible to have announced such an important political initiative four months ago only to give in to the pressures of those who do not want the United Nations to pronounce against the death penalty."
"The risk of defeat?"
"I am thinking more of the duty of battle, the duty of the political battle that the European Union must carry on its own shoulders."
"In conclusion, as the President-in-Office of the Council leaves for China, we also entrust him with the task of reminding that country that, when faced with the value of human life, there can be no political expediency or hierarchy, not even towards China."
"Mr President, the UN Charter of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."
"Last year, 31 countries breached this crucially important article, which supports what is human and alive and promotes a civilised and humane society."
"Thirty-one countries believed they had the right to take the lives of their own citizens."
"According to Amnesty International, a total of 1 526 people were executed in these 31 countries, and 3 284 people were condemned to death in 67 countries."
"Slightly more than 80% of the executions took place in three countries: China, Iran and the United States."
"Commissioner, Minister, you know all this."
"China is the worst of them all."
"It is nonetheless deeply tragic to have to place the democratic United States on the same list as the two dictatorships."
"As a sincere friend of the United States, that pains me a great deal."
"How can a democratic and civilised country such as the United States continue to apply the death penalty?"
"In the United States, the number of executions increased last year to 71, compared to 66 the year before."
"I do not in actual fact believe, Mr President, that many Americans are aware that the United States does not fulfil the requirements for becoming a member of the EU, and I am convinced that the United States should be influenced to change its attitude."
"That would make it so much more difficult for other countries in the League of Death."
"Might the American people be less open to the facts than us Europeans?"
"Thousands of innocent people have been condemned to death and executed."
"Might the American people be less humane than ourselves?"
"No, that is not true, but, in that case, more courageous leaders are needed who wish, and dare, to take up the debate in pursuit of justice and human dignity."
"Is it possible, Commissioner and Minister, to engage in bargaining when it comes to the total abolition of the death penalty?"
"I doubt it."
"I believe that a very clear approach is required in this area."
"This popular revolt against the death penalty, the first step in which is a worldwide moratorium, must be supported wholeheartedly by the EU and the Italian Presidency."
"You must not hesitate in this area, gentlemen."
"The responsibility lies with yourselves, Minister and Commissioner."
"The death penalty must be abolished."
"It is not negotiable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I believe we should welcome the fact that the cause fought for by the abolitionists has become, in the space of a few decades, a few generations, one of the general public’s most passionate demands in the field of human rights."
"When in 1961, abolitionists such as Martin Luther King talked about abolishing the death penalty, it appeared to be a pipe-dream."
"The following generation – my own – was made aware of the issue as a result of the policy conducted in this area in France, when François Mitterrand and Robert Badinter abolished the death penalty in 1981."
"We should also bear in mind that countries we thought would never abolish the death penalty so quickly, such as Turkey and various candidate countries, have succeeded in doing so, by showing some real political will, especially since our sitting in this Chamber in June 2001."
"I therefore believe that, as regards this issue, instead of talking about tactics, it would be infinitely preferable to talk about political convictions and the will to back up these convictions."
"In fact, when our fellow Member, Mr Ari Vatanen, takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally wearing a badge that features the words ‘no death penalty’, he is raising the awareness of an entire continent."
"By the way, as Mrs Trautmann said, what is at stake is our ability to tame our instincts for revenge."
"When we rally forces, we manage to save a Nigerian woman who had children outside marriage from the death penalty."
"I believe that if we rally forces again, we will be able to get a man named Mumia Abu-Jamal off death row."
"He has been imprisoned only because he is black, because he was a journalist, because he spoke out for those who have no voice and because he spoke out against the abuses perpetrated by Philadelphia’s racist police."
"It is with all of these individuals in mind that I say today we should think carefully."
"As regards the death penalty, the colour at stake is not black or white, but the colour of blood."
"This is why, in my opinion, we must not extradite people to countries where we know they can expect the death penalty."
"In particular, it upsets me to think about our fellow citizens currently in Guantanamo, because we do not know what their fate might be."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what is needed is political will, not tactics."
"– Mr President, one of the great areas of historical tension in our age is the struggle between state sovereignty and universal human rights."
"The traditional power of sovereign rulers appears above all to be the right to make decisions about the life and property of their subjects."
"In an era of nation states we have failed to rid ourselves of two serious and persistent breaches of fundamental human rights, namely the death penalty and the widespread use of torture."
"It is excellent that the European Union, whose own external sovereignty is very weak, has, in a core area of its foreign policy, human rights, focused on the elimination of these two serious ills especially now when thoughts about armed security dominate the shaping of the new world order and at the same time violence against a country’s own citizens is worryingly becoming of relative importance."
"A state that kills and tortures should never have international legitimacy."
"The fateful question the UN system has to address is the conflict I mentioned at the beginning."
"The universal organisation’s particular strength has indeed been considered to be respect for human rights, but at the same time its Charter is firmly anchored in the notion of state sovereignty."
"It thus lies at the point where two eras and two different political views of the world meet."
"I believe the time is now ripe to take this step forward and do all we can to try for a comprehensive moratorium to let the death penalty just smoulder everywhere in the world as an interim stage in eliminating it once and for all."
"The plan will involve diplomatic and other types of risks, but the goal will make them worth taking."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite repeated calls from many quarters for the protection of human rights to manifest itself in the abolition of the death penalty, we have not only seen an increase in death sentences in some countries in recent years but also systems of execution becoming crueller, with barbaric methods used."
"In asking for a moratorium on the death penalty, at the very least, the would like to mention, merely by way of example and on the basis of the, of necessity, partial facts that were provided by Amnesty International for 2002, that, in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Sudan alone there were 113, 48 and 40 executions respectively, not to mention the 1 060 carried out in China."
"In light of this, whilst upholding the urgent need for a moratorium on the death penalty, we must call, just as fervently, for the European Union and the United Nations to intervene regarding these countries in which the punishments given are not linked to secular rules but to fundamentalist cultures or traditions of any structure."
"Furthermore, whilst upholding every individual’s right to religious freedom, we need to declare with conviction that the enforcement of the in a State or part of it cannot be accepted by the Member States of the European Union."
"This is why the moratorium on the death penalty must be accompanied by sanctions that Europe must impose on those governments which do not accept the moratorium and continue to apply the death penalty with cruel techniques such as, for example, stoning to death."
"One of the sanctions that we would like to see would be a suspension of economic relations with these countries: continuing to help the citizens, where possible, but no longer trafficking – if you will excuse the term – with those countries whose governments knowingly continue to violate human rights."
"Europe cannot impose its laws and its concept of democracy onto other countries, but neither can it continue to have effective economic relations with governments that are founded on the violation of the most fundamental human rights because, in these countries, the death penalty is not only a punishment inflicted by courts or carried out by the executioner but also one which is inflicted every day by hunger, desperation and violence that drive whole populations to seek refuge elsewhere and even, as has been happening in Somalia since 1991, to die in the waters of the Indian Ocean or in the Sicilian Canal."
"Finally, the death penalty is also a punishment that terrorists are continually giving by killing unarmed citizens."
"Consequently, there is no hope of actually obtaining a moratorium on the death penalty if we do not also impose sanctions on those who enforce inhumane and fundamentalist laws and cover up terrorist actions as well."
"The time is right Mr President for the Italian Presidency to press Parliament to make a symbolic gesture, to ask Iran to pardon the young woman condemned to death for killing the man who was raping her."
"Europe’s involvement in this could give new hope to so many women oppressed by the extremist and inhumane vision of all too many governments."
"Mr President, I have been allocated 90 seconds as president of and as a representative of the Transnational Radical Party, which has been fighting for decades to, at last – and I am saying this to President Frattini – state our convictions instead of doing verbal gymnastics around conventions in an undignified manner."
"In 1994, we only lost by eight votes in the UN, because of the concern of Singapore and other States that these proposals for a moratorium would reduce national sovereignty."
"To date, 33 States have become abolitionist and have enforced the moratorium."
"The Italian Presidency has proclaimed and is continuing to proclaim loud and clear its conviction in this battle, taking every single opportunity, every single day in this rubbish heap of pretexts and excuses, every opportunity, to go against its commitments."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are fighting a battle so that the convictions that we accept or claim to accept are, at least to a minimal extent, honoured in our country too, if possible, and also in Europe – with or without you – and so that we can stop unworthily conforming to foolish, mistaken conventions."
"My time has run out but I fear that your time is running out for credibility and decency."
"I hope that this is not yet the case but you are in danger and putting us in danger of indecency and not being believed."
"– Mr President—in-Office of the Council, I do believe that it is essential that the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States of course, presents a motion for a resolution to the United Nations General Assembly calling for the adoption of a universal moratorium on death penalties."
"What is more, I also believe we have the obligation to present such a motion."
"Prudence cannot be allowed to make us forget our commitment to defend the right to life or our responsibility to work to increase international cooperation with a view to achieving the complete abolition of the death penalty in the world, because the death penalty is a violation of the fundamental right to life, and what is worse – as Amnesty International says – is that this violation is not only not hidden or denied, but is actually enshrined in the laws of the country which applies it."
"Furthermore, if a country does not respect the most fundamental of rights, with what authority will it demand from citizens respect for other rights and on what foundations will that country base its democracy and Rule of Law if its law allows the most important and most fundamental of rights to be violated: the right to life?"
"For the European Union, therefore, the fight to abolish the death penalty and the fight for democracy and respect for human rights are and must be one and the same."
"It is true that progress has been made in this regard and that today far fewer countries maintain the death penalty in their legislation, but we are still far from its total abolition, as the statistics so cruelly demonstrate."
"The European Union, therefore, in order to be coherent in terms of the values on which it is founded, must make fighting the death penalty a priority, not only before the United Nations General Assembly, but also in its relations with third countries which have yet to abolish it, whatever links the Union may have with these countries or their strategic or commercial importance, because nobody must be given the power to decide on the life or death of a human being."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments to give absolute clarification on this issue, which is very important to the Italian Presidency."
"In many speeches, I have heard a call to the Italian Presidency to present the resolution to the United Nations General Assembly, on behalf of the European Union."
"What I did not hear – but which I hope Parliament will be able to establish in its deliberations – was anything regarding a situation which I felt it was my duty to mention in my speech."
"There is not – and I repeat, there is not – unanimous agreement within the Member States of the European Union that the Italian Presidency should present a resolution on behalf of Europe."
"In light of this, there are two options: either Parliament asks the Council Presidency to present a document on behalf of the European Union when not all of the Members of the EU agree – and this is the first option – or it must be clearly stated that Italy, even holding the Presidency of the European Union, can present a resolution even without the consensus of some Member States – without this, however, being seen as a grave violation of the spirit of cohesion in the European Union that we must demonstrate."
"Italy, as a nation, is in favour of doing so, but it is in favour – and I repeat this – of doing so when it becomes totally clear that, within the framework of the European Union, not all Member States are in favour, not of a moratorium because we are all in favour of a moratorium, not of abolition, because we are all in favour of that, but of a resolution now being presented."
"Since I believe that I have now been clearer, I will say that the Italian Presidency is not only in favour but very much in favour of presenting a resolution on behalf of Europe, but if Europe does not unite on this issue, can we present a resolution – undoubtedly not on behalf of Europe – saying that Europe is divided on this?"
"I am ready to comply with this request when Parliament says what it thinks in this regard."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forgive me, but I do not understand the answer we have been given."
"I do not understand it at all and I still do not know whether or not the presidency will support our demands."
"I suggest that you take up that matter with the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I have received five motions for resolutions from different political groups.(1)"
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
". A universal moratorium is called for here on a regular basis, but when will this actually be implemented?"
"Good will on the part of Europe is no longer enough."
"Abolishing the death penalty must be seen as a crucial aspect of the EU’s relations with third countries."
"Throughout the world countries continue to perpetrate this State crime."
"This barbaric practice still takes place in particular in Japan, China, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and in Iran, where executions are still carried out."
"What is worse, between 2001 and 2002, the number of executions increased."
"It has become impossible to remain silent about this ‘administrative murder’, especially when it is carried out by the most powerful country in the world, which is attempting to impose its order and its values on the rest of the world."
"We cannot accept that the only solution to crime and violence is crime and violence itself."
"Like the newly created World Association of Parliamentarians against the Death Penalty and in line with the worldwide call for abolition, the European Union must exert all necessary pressure to ensure that the United Nations adopts a moratorium that would have lead rapidly to the abolition of the death penalty."
"Men and women are left to rot on death row and Mumia Abu-Jamal is one of these."
"Preventing the irreparable must be done as a matter of urgency."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0279/2003)."
"We will take a series of questions to the Council."
"Question No 1 will not be replied to because its subject already appears on the agenda of the present part-session."
"The establishment of a European police academy and a joint frontier protection force for the external frontiers are central demands of the European Parliament."
"What are the prospects for further development of these plans, and when will the Council decide on the definitive seat of the European police academy?"
"In 2002, the Commission presented a Communication on the integrated management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which gave a comprehensive view of future border management."
"Again, in 2002, a feasibility study, led by Italy, was presented in Rome on setting up a European border police force."
"The following June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted a plan for the management of external borders that was the basis for all further activity in the area."
"On the basis of these documents, in Seville in 2002, the European Council specified priority measures and asked for a common unit of external border practitioners to be set up, made up of Member States’ heads of border control services and charged with coordinating the measures contained in the plan."
"Furthermore, this also provided for the rapid implementation of joint operations at external borders and the immediate commencement of pilot projects."
"These operations and projects have been implemented or have been in the process of being implemented since 2002 and 2003."
"In June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council decided – as you know – to create a Common Unit of External Border Practitioners to make this European strategy more effective."
"This unit has been set up and is operating in the Council."
"In the Thessaloniki conclusions, the Council invites the Commission to examine the need to create new institutional mechanisms, including a European operational structure, in order to enhance operational cooperation for the management of external borders."
"On 16 and 17 October in Brussels, the European Council welcomed the Commission’s intention to submit a proposal for the creation of a European Border Management Agency, in order to enhance operational cooperation, in time for the Council to be able to reach a political agreement on the main elements of the agency by the end of 2003."
"This proposal will draw on the experience of the Common Unit of External Border Practitioners."
"Furthermore, the European Council took note of the study carried out for the Commission on maritime borders and invited the Justice and Home Affairs Council to draw up a working programme on this issue to be adopted by the end of the year."
"Finally, regarding the European police college: this was set up by the Council decision of December 2000, it began operating in 2001 and is temporarily based in Denmark."
"A decision regarding its permanent site will depend on the recommendations given by the European Council."
"– Thank you, Mr Frattini, for your answer, which was extremely good and specific, and for the very good work that the Italian Presidency of the Council has done in this area."
"I have just two specific supplementary questions."
"Firstly, will the group of border experts to which you have referred produce a written report at some point in the course of the year or at the end of the year, or will it take even longer?"
"That is my first question."
"My second brief question has to do with the Police College."
"Do you think, as regards the issue of where the various bodies are to be based, many aspects of which are still open, that this package can be got to grips with before the end of the Italian Presidency, or will it – and the issue of the Police College not be able to be sorted out before the end of this year?"
"A decision has not yet been made on the location of the agency, and so I cannot say whether it will be the Italian Presidency that examines the overall package."
"Nevertheless, I can say that Common Unit of External Border Practitioners reports and will continue to report regularly, since it is clear that all preparatory work for the future agency will be based – as I said – on the experience of this working group."
"This is why we value the cooperation between the Commission and the Council, particularly from the coming months onwards."
"– Mr President, at present a team of experts in the field of border control operate in Finland. It includes a few officials."
"If this joint border police agency were located somewhere other than in Finland would the intention be for this Finnish team of experts also to be ultimately stationed there?"
"In other words, has the Council any plans at this time regarding what is to happen to this team of border control experts that currently operate in Finland?"
"C These are technical problems, which I take note of."
"The principle is that of a European agency that coordinates all operations."
"Clearly, therefore, where there are working groups, their experience will be taken into consideration."
"Obviously, we have not yet looked into the technical aspects of coordination."
"Parliament has noted year after year, in its reports on human rights in the EU, the dramatic and disturbing state of affairs in the Union's prisons. It has repeatedly called on the Council and Commission to take action to define certain minimum standards with regard to respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of prisoners in the Union."
"The President-in-Office of the Justice and Internal Affairs Council, Mr Roberto Castelli, has announced on behalf of the Italian Presidency, at hearings held by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that an inquiry is to be carried out into the execution of sentences and prison systems."
"Mr Castelli stated in an article published on 7 August 2003 in the 'Corriere della Sera' that he had 'launched an initiative for the definition of thresholds of acceptable conditions in the EU's prisons'."
"Can the Council provide details of this initiative, specifying its expected stages and the progress achieved so far and setting out its objectives? Can it send the relevant documents to Parliament?"
"Does the Council, in particular, intend to prepare a framework decision on the matter, given that this is the only instrument that can ensure that the standards are binding and are properly respected?"
"I can inform Mr Dell’Alba that the Council has received neither a proposal nor a legislative initiative on this matter."
"Despite this, being aware of the importance of the question, the Italian Presidency raised the issue of the execution of prison sentences at an informal meeting of Ministers for Justice held in Rome on 13 September 2003."
"As you can see, we are waiting for developments in this debate, which the Presidency initiated."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke as such and you replied in this role as if you were not also the representative of the Italian Government."
"Mr Turco’s question said exactly this: that your colleague, Mr Castelli – also President-in-Office but also a member of a government of a Member State and as such entitled to present the proposal to which you refer – announced on 7 August, in the and in a Parliamentary hearing, that the Italian Government, or he, personally, intended to launch an initiative to define minimum standards of living in European prisons."
"Since we thought it an excellent idea and since Parliament has been calling on the Council to do this very thing for years – and I would now add the idea of extending the right that Italian deputies have to visit prisons to MEPs – I would like to ask if you can confirm this intention in this House on behalf of the Italian Presidency."
"I do not feel I can reply as a representative of the Italian Government."
"I can only say, as a representative of the Presidency, that this debate was commenced – as I said before – at an informal meeting of the Ministers for Justice."
"There will clearly soon be developments and results that, at the moment, we are not in a position to predict, given that the debate began on 13 September, less than a month ago."
"A few days ago, a framework agreement on customs union was signed between Turkey and the occupying regime in northern Cyprus."
"Given that Turkey is not entitled to conclude trade agreements without the approval of the European Union, not to mention the fact that the signing of such an agreement with Denktash's self-styled 'state' is tantamount to provocation vis-à-vis the European Union and the Republic of Cyprus, which is to join the EU in 2004, does the Council believe that the signing of this agreement represents a positive contribution by Turkey to efforts to resolve the Cyprus question, as it undertook to do on the basis of the Helsinki Agreement and the European Union/Turkey Association Agreement?"
"The European Union has expressed its concern to Turkey about the framework agreement on customs union with the Republic of Northern Cyprus and, in particular, stated that, over and above the implications of a legal and commercial nature, the signing of the said agreement damages the efforts intended to resolve the Cyprus issue and goes against the spirit of the plan drawn up by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan."
"The European Union has taken note of the reply from the Turkish Government – with which it is satisfied – to the effect that it has decided not to ratify and not to enforce this agreement, deemed incompatible with the customs union with Turkey."
"The European Union is expecting Turkey to abide by this decision and withdraw the current trade measures with Northern Cyprus that are violating the Europe-Turkey customs union."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"This is one step, but it is not enough."
"This agreement bears the signatures of the Turkish prime minister, the Turkish Government, and it is before Parliament; simply it will not be put to the vote."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office if the European Union will call for this agreement to be cancelled outright as it is provocation for the regime of Turkey as a candidate country and of the customs union between Turkey and the European Union."
"I can confirm that we will continue to urge Turkey not to ratify the agreement and, clearly, an agreement that has not been ratified is a void agreement in legal terms, in the sense that it cannot and must not be enforced."
"I think that we must check that Turkey does actually act on the commitment that it has given and we hope and trust that it will be made good."
"On 19 August 2003, the Zimbabwe Government requisitioned the food supplies held by aid organisations so that it might distribute the food itself."
"The aid organisations are very worried."
"The Mugabe regime has already been accused in the past of making the provision of food aid conditional upon political affiliation."
"Opponents receive nothing."
"At present, more than three million people in Zimbabwe are starving."
"Aid organisations fear that that figure will rise to five million by the end of the year."
"Land reform measures are likely to add to the problems."
"The Commercial Farmers' Union claims that 2 900 holdings (mainly farmed by whites) will have to close down."
"Press reports suggest that a large shipment of cereals from the EU is expected to arrive during the next few weeks."
"What measures are being taken to prevent that food aid from being misused for political purposes and to ensure that it reaches the needy?"
"The Council is concerned about the deterioration of the food situation in Zimbabwe and is opposed to any attempt to make the supply of food aid dependent on political criteria."
"The European Union’s food aid policy and its management are regulated by a 1996 Council regulation, pursuant to which the Commission adopts all the provisions necessary for food aid programmes and actions to be implemented properly."
"To this end, the Member States and the Commission provide each other with the necessary help and any useful information."
"In its common position of 18 February 2002 on Zimbabwe, the Council expressed serious concern at the situation in this country, in particular the renewed violence, and imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe."
"This common position was extended until 20 February 2004."
"According to the Union’s guidelines on food distribution in Zimbabwe, agreed by the Commission and the Heads of Mission in Harare in 2002, the management and distribution of food are based on need and not on political criteria."
"The impartial distribution of aid will be a joint endeavour carried out in consultation with the main interested parties."
"It will provide for a participatory and transparent selection of recipients."
"Each distribution programme will have an independent monitoring system in order to manage selection, distribution, surveillance and possible complaints."
"The European Union has harboured serious concerns at the publication, by the Zimbabwe Government, of the new policy relating to the operations of non-governmental organisations providing humanitarian aid and development aid."
"Towards the end of September 2003, the Zimbabwe Government signed Memoranda of Understanding with Euronet and the World Food Programme (WFP) on the principles of food distribution and has made some effort to clarify how it intends to apply the new policy to the operations of NGOs."
"After these developments, the Member States agreed that the Heads of Mission are to launch a widespread initiative in the main capitals, with the exception of Harare, to inform the European Union’s regional partners of concerns relating to the issues associated with delivering food and humanitarian aid in Zimbabwe."
"The Presidency is currently preparing the mandate for the aforementioned initiative."
"The Union will continue to follow the development of the food crisis closely, in the hope that the Zimbabwe Government will, indeed, respect the humanitarian principles of the recently-signed Memoranda of Understanding."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr Frattini, could you perhaps give me a concrete answer to the question whether the Council intends to act on Mr Mugabe's dictate and, whether or not they do, whether it is intended to continue to provide direct aid to the NGOs that are active in Zimbabwe."
"Or are we going to follow the guidelines issued by the Zimbabwean Government and deliver the food aid directly to the government bodies?"
"Meanwhile, you may like to know that the situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated even more, in the sense that there is now also a shortage of fertiliser for the production of food, a shortage of fuel and such like."
"The situation is therefore getting worse all the time."
"I am a little worried that the response will be inadequate if all that is done is to maintain existing sanctions up to, and including, February 2004."
"At the meeting between the Council Presidency and German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, in Verona on 23 August 2003, the idea of establishing an EU Coastguard Service was discussed (as reported in the Sunday Times of the 24 August 2003)."
"In the light of this initiative, might I draw the Council's attention to a proposal that I submitted on this issue to the Convention on the Future of Europe (CONV 150/02)? I should be interested in learning what is the Council Presidency's reaction to the proposal."
"As Mr Cushnahan knows from the Council’s reply to his previous question, the Commission was commissioned to carry out a feasibility study to improve controls at maritime borders following the adoption of the comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings in February 2002."
"The report contains some recommendations on ways of improving border controls and refers to the possible establishment of an operational structure."
"The Commission forwarded this report to the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 12/13 September 2003."
"The Council is looking into this report to draw any possible conclusions."
"These actions are testimony to the importance that the Council accords the issue of controls at maritime borders."
"We are convinced that the management of external borders should have a substantial European dimension if we are to succeed in making progress in implementing measures that have already been determined by the Council seeking to combat illegal immigration and associated crime."
"I welcome the fact that the Italian Presidency is interested in the concept of the European coastguard and recognises the fragility of our maritime borders rather than – and it has happened in the past – an exclusive preoccupation with land frontiers."
"While I am aware of the Commission proposal, would the presidency not accept that the issue of illegal trafficking in human beings is not the only problem on our seas?"
"Criminals have used our seas in many ways to ply their evil trades, which include illegal trafficking in drugs and cigarette smuggling."
"Also to be borne in mind are the problems caused by shipping disasters."
"We have also had major problems with regard to marine pollution, the package and, more recently, the disaster."
"Would the presidency also accept that, given the low stocks which exist in our seas vis-à-vis fishing, there are a lot of things that a European coastguard could do along the lines of the US Coastguard?"
"Is it not time for a proposal on a multi-faceted approach, which does not deal solely with the issue of illegal trafficking in human beings, but covers all these aspects?"
"If we address the concerns of European citizens, we are always concerned about how to make Europe more relevant."
"If we came forward with a definitive proposal to tackle these problems, we could make Europe very relevant by addressing the real fears of the citizens across a whole host of areas."
"In the last 10 years, more than 320 corpses of women and girls have been found in Ciudad Juárez in Mexico."
"A total of 4 476 women and girls, average age between 14 and 16, have disappeared in Mexican cities."
"The ineffectiveness of the Mexican authorities' investigations means that these women, who are suffering the gravest possible violation of their fundamental rights, are without protection."
"Moreover, the Mexican authorities do not comply with the recommendations and action plan of the UN IVth World Women's Conference, or the commitments they have undertaken in the United Nation Convention for eliminating all forms of discrimination against women."
"Will the Council communicate to the government of the United Mexican States the disquiet provoked by the crimes which have taken place in Ciudad Juárez and other Mexican cities, and request details of what action has been taken?"
"Does the Council intend, within the framework of the Cooperation Agreement with Mexico, to provide the necessary assistance to help clarify, with the Mexican authorities, these appalling crimes?"
"Women’s rights and the issue of enforced disappearances are a source of particular concern for the European Union."
"According to international law and on the basis of ethical and constitutional principles common to all the Member States of the European Union, we have urged governments to commit to the UN resolutions and decisions and to enforce all the rules, laws and programmes seeking to ensure that women can fully enjoy all rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal footing with men."
"The European Union monitors and regularly discusses with the Mexican authorities the human rights situation in Mexico and compliance with the country’s undertakings under international law."
"The Union has been encouraged by the clear commitment to human rights for everyone made by President Fox’s administration and his pledge to considering this one of the most important priorities of his government."
"We welcomed Mexico’s cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights (UNHCR)."
"Nevertheless, according to some sources, the government’s good intentions and new approach have not yet been completely turned into tangible results."
"The recent restructuring carried out by the undersecretary for democracy and human rights in the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National Human Rights Commission’s recent decision to cancel the Ombudsman project that had been financed by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights have given rise to much concern."
"Mexico was chosen as one of three priority Latin American countries to benefit from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for the period 2002-2004."
"The Mexican authorities should therefore renew their commitment to make progress in the field of human rights in cooperation with international partners, including the important UNHCR programme in Mexico."
"The European Union will continue to monitor the human rights situation and will discuss it with the Mexican authorities at the first useful opportunity, which will be the meeting of the Joint Association Committee to take place next November, under the Italian Presidency."
"– Mr President—in-Office of the Council, the problem you have raised in the reply to my question satisfied me only in part."
"That is because, unfortunately, over the last ten years – as you well know – specifically in Ciudad Juárez, more than 320 bodies of women and girls have appeared."
"Furthermore, more than 4 470 women and girls of between 14 and 16 years old have disappeared."
"I would therefore like, in addition to the action the Council is going to take with Mexico in relation to the Agreement, to see an examination of what specific actions – since we are not talking about a violation of human rights in general, but a very specific case which involves the disappearances and deaths of many women and girls, specifically in Ciudad Juárez – have been taken by Mexico to try to verify these facts, and, on the other hand, whether it is possible, and whether the Council will allow it, to consider what assistance is being requested by the authorities of that country so that the international community may contribute to clarifying these facts, which are very serious."
"This past summer has seen a major increase in illegal immigration by means of small boats along the EU's southern frontier. The exiguous existing services are simply unable to deal with the changing routes taken by the vessels, and are in no logistical position to cope with the enormous scale on which this problem is developing."
"Given the fact that Commissioner Vitorino will shortly be presenting reports (Argo and Ulises) and balance-sheets on this issue, and given the urgent need for the new measures to include the Granada (Spain) coastline, where the situation has worsened with the extreme sharpening of containment measures in the Tarifa area, what measures does the Council envisage to improve this situation?"
"The issue – which has had such tragic consequences – of the arrival in what are known as ‘old tubs’ of so many desperate people who come to try their luck in Europe, has resurfaced once again."
"The Thessaloniki European Council invited the Commission to examine the need to create new institutional mechanisms, including a possible European operational structure – I have just mentioned this – in order to enhance operational cooperation for the management of external borders."
"As I mentioned earlier, the aim is to approve the launch of a European agency specialised in this area at the December European Council."
"The Council recalls, furthermore, that, in the context of the plan for the management of external borders of the Member States of the European Union, some joint operations have already been put in place that seek to monitor and reduce illegal immigration via the sea."
"A final progress report on the implementation of this plan for the management of external borders, with evaluations of the results, was presented in June 2003 and then forwarded to the Thessaloniki Council."
"On the basis of this experience and on the basis of the suggestions from the European Centre on risk analysis, measures are in place and new operations will be launched."
"Among these I would like to just focus on the project called ‘Neptune’ which only began in September 2003, just a few weeks ago."
"This operation involves implementing joint surveillance and monitoring operations in the central and eastern Mediterranean, and various Member States and accession countries are involved."
"This is – I would stress – just one important case to which I hope more will be added shortly."
"Furthermore, I would like to draw Mrs Izquierdo Rojo’s attention to the importance of cooperation with countries of origin and transit."
"This issue is part of a broad, comprehensive approach to immigration that is balanced and integrated."
"We must make sure that we create conditions for development in countries of origin and transit that prevent the flow of desperate people from leaving for Europe."
"Particular attention, in this respect, was given to creating a network of liaison officers, to be formally approved by the end of 2003, whose job it will be, precisely, to create a support network for European initiatives to regulate the whole phenomenon of migration."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply and for the measures adopted by the Council."
"I believe, however, that the Council is not adopting them with the speed that this situation calls for, because these are measures that will be adopted at the beginning of 2004 at the earliest and we will have to wait for a year or more for them to be put into practice."
"We have been warning of this for some time."
"These are urgent and specific assistance measures so that these human beings can be provided with the necessary assistance services."
"In this regard, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, could you not give us some specific information on this funding, which is necessary to update assistance services in those regions in which the boats are arriving, where the immigrants are arriving?"
"Can you not give me some specific information here and now?"
"I can only say to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo – as I have already said – that at least one of these programmes is, in actual fact, operational: it is called ‘Project Neptune’, began in September 2003 and provides for operations that are already underway."
"As regards funding, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is well aware that it is the Commission that decides and deliberates on the conditions."
"I will take note of these concerns, which I, personally, share, and I will also make the Commission aware of them."
"Almost half of the members and alternates in the Convention on the future of the European Union concerning the proposed EU Constitution have signed an appeal calling for national referendums in which the citizens of each individual Member State will decide whether to accept or reject the final proposal of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"What is the Council's position on whether the citizens of each Member State should be given the opportunity – in the form of direct democracy through national referendums – to express their opinion on the Constitution for the European Union?"
"Does the Council see this as an opportunity for citizens to enhance their knowledge of the development of the EU?"
"Mr Sacrédeus has raised an issue which it is for neither the Council nor the Council Presidency to comment on: the organisation of popular consultation at national level and, therefore, the competence of Member States."
"We have stated our position, which could obviously be the position of each individual Member State of the European Union; each one is governed by different laws regarding popular consultation."
"There are States in Europe that do not make provision for referendums and there are those in favour of the possibility of European referendums on the draft Constitutional Treaty."
"They are all ideas and proposals, which neither the Presidency nor I can judge or comment upon now."
"The extremely sensitive and important issue of popular approval of the draft Treaty is an issue for the Member States, and each State is governed by different laws."
"It is not, therefore, a matter on which the Council can give its opinion."
"Moreover, I can express a hope and an opinion which is mine alone, perhaps a dream, certainly not a practical situation that is feasible in the near future: that of a European referendum, in which all the citizens of Europe give their opinions on the draft Treaty on the same day."
"I define this a personal thought and a dream because I am aware that it will be difficult for it to be practicable."
"I wish sincerely to thank the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, and the Council Presidency for that answer."
"I believe it is incredibly important for Italy, as the country holding the Presidency, to have its own view and, thus, for the Council Presidency to operate as a model."
"I think it is very important to raise the level of knowledge and commitment and to focus more upon European issues in domestic policy, both in Italy and Sweden."
"My follow-up question to Mr Frattini is about the way in which the Council Presidency views the fact that more and more countries’ governments and parliaments have now said that they wish to hold referendums on the draft European Constitution."
"Do you take a positive view of this development?"
"My second follow-up question is this: do you yourselves see a possibility of Italy’s being able to take such a decision as a model for other countries and governments?"
"I will reply very briefly and the answer is obviously ‘yes’."
"We are in favour of any initiative that gives force and popular legitimacy to the current constitutional process, but this is a favourable view and a vision that, as you so rightly said, Mr Sacrédeus, cannot impose solutions on other countries’ constitutional systems."
"Mr Frattini, we have just heard your opinions and we would like to thank you."
"I think that they were very clear."
"I would like to ask whether, in the evaluations given to date and in the proposals put forward by individual Member States to establish the Convention text, or rather the Constitutional Treaty, there have been any evaluations or whether ideas have been included regarding the proposed referendums."
"I understood, and we know, that our systems do not provide for an abrogative referendum, nor does the possibility currently exist of subjecting this Constitutional Treaty to a similar evaluation."
"Are there any ideas or not regarding the proposed referendum?"
"I can say to Mr Ebner that there have not been any proposals to this effect."
"My personal opinion – and I emphasise, my personal opinion – is that any ideas that can enrich the popular legitimacy of the new treaty will be interesting and valuable proposals, but, of course, there are some national systems that can hold referendums of this type and other systems that cannot."
"I can, however, say, Mr Ebner, that, in the course of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, no one presented these ideas."
"– Mr President, I want to ask about Europe’s next big ‘referendum’, namely the elections to the European Parliament on 13 June next year."
"What is the Presidency contemplating doing to increase voter turnout on that day, along with their understanding of the European Union?"
"I will be extremely brief in my reply to Mr Rübig."
"This is a competence that we share with the Irish Presidency, which will have the honour and duty of leading the Council from 2 January."
"My opinion is that, in order to convince the citizens of the importance of European elections, we must obtain good results when drawing up the Constitutional Treaty."
"I will try explaining this the other way around: if we do not reach an agreement on the Constitutional Treaty by the end of the year, then this will be a powerful weapon to discourage the public from voting because we will have sent the public a message of crisis in our European ideal."
"The first thing that we need to do is, therefore, show that, after the many, long months of the Convention and the Conference on the constituent debate, that we reach agreement on the Treaty."
"This is the first sign."
"For this reply, I will refer to the Council declaration on trans-European networks, which we presented on 24 September during the last plenary session in Strasbourg."
"Regarding the outermost regions, it is fair to say that they are disadvantaged because of their geographical location and the fact that they are islands, as recognised by Article 299(2) of the Treaty."
"The issue must, indeed, be dealt with not only with words but also with a major support action."
"These regions, with a population of 3.8 million inhabitants, received EUR 7 200 million during the first two Structural Funds periods, which means that every inhabitant in these regions received 33% more than those in the Objective 1 regions."
"In 2002, the Commission forwarded a regulation to increase the funding of the trans-European networks."
"This proposal is still being discussed, but the Council is expecting a new proposal to be forwarded, amending the decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, adopted by the Commission on 1 October 2003, just a few days ago."
"The Council will have to look into the scope of the new proposal."
"Commission Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, explained the proposal to the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 9 October 2003."
"The Council gave a mandate to its bodies, having only just received the proposal from the Commission, to begin the relevant work to adopt a political decision on this matter as soon as possible."
"The Italian Presidency considers the enhancement of the trans-European networks to be a priority; the objectives include adopting the aforementioned proposal and looking into other possible sources of funding for these networks."
"The last meeting of the European Council led to a call for proposals to be finalised seeking to eliminate technical, legal and administrative barriers to trans-European networks, in particular with regard to cross-border sections, public private partnerships (PPPs) and innovation, research and development projects."
"The Commission will therefore clarify the principles on national accounting treatment of PPPs to ensure increased transparency, including the registration of government guarantees in national accounts and securitisation."
"Furthermore, the European Council invited the Commission and the EIB to present final reports on the Growth Initiative, in particular to develop better coordination of procedures between EIB financing, the Structural Funds, the trans-European networks’ budget line and the Sixth Framework Programme."
"I would like to inform you that Mr Frattini must leave at 7 p.m. on the dot and Mr Ebner, Mr Crowley and Mr Rübig, as well as the two Members tabling questions, have asked me for the floor."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I tabled the question before the Commission adopted its proposal on the trans-European networks, but it was motivated by a very timely proposal by the Italian Presidency, which appears to be producing results, both in the Council's approval of its proposal, and also the incorporation of transport to the island of Sicily, which is a recognition of the special nature of island regions."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has stressed the special nature of the outermost regions, based on Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, but, on seeing the projects approved by the Commission, I note that there is only one which could involve the outermost regions, and that is the one relating to sea motorways."
"They could perhaps also be included in the project on telecommunications networks, but what is striking about this report is that it does not contain the least reference to this type of region, and the European Union's experience demonstrates that, if there is no specific reference in these projects to the outermost regions, it is probable that the strengthening of continental communications networks will in no way benefit these regions."
"I would therefore call on the Presidency of the Council, in accordance with the comments it has itself made, to ensure that the Council takes account of their special situation."
"Like Mr Medina Ortega, I also want to say that not enough is being done in favour of ultraperipheral regions."
"In Ireland, for example, the network into and out of Ireland is often considered sufficient, but the west of Ireland is even more peripheral and remote, and this problem is not addressed by the Commission's present policy."
"There is no railway line connecting the regions in the west of Ireland – all networks lead to Dublin, which is not peripheral."
"There is already a rail link in place in the west, but it is not used as a result of the fact that the policy is not strong enough to put in place such a network in the peripheral regions of the west of Ireland."
"I feel obliged to remind you that this is a time for supplementary questions, not statements or explanations about why a question has been presented, because this afternoon the same issue is arising."
"I would ask you to read the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to ask Mr Frattini whether, when referring to less favoured areas, this should not only be understood to be the outermost regions but also mountainous regions, because these, too, are penalised for geographical reasons."
"I am happy to answer Mr Ebner’s last question, although, of course, I have also taken note of the other comments that I have heard."
"I would like to say to Mr Ebner that the Presidency recognises the importance of giving particular emphasis to mountainous regions, in so far as we received, when drawing up the draft constitutional Treaty itself, some proposals which seek precisely to recognise the specific nature of mountain regions."
"These proposals are some of the few that the Presidency has agreed to discuss, and they have, therefore, been added to the agenda for debate that is to take place shortly at the level of Ministers for Foreign Affairs."
"I must say, therefore, that we recognise the serious nature of this issue."
"President-in-Office, in your response to the original questions you stated that work was to be undertaken to look at the technical, legal and administrative barriers with regard to the trans-European networks."
"In particular, you mentioned two things: the public/private partnerships with regard to financing and also how the record of government guarantees is registered."
"We have already come across situations where public/private partnerships are included in the government borrowing requirement, which puts them inside the Stability and Growth Pact, affecting the government borrowing requirement."
"Surely this is a mistake, as we are investing in infrastructure that is essential for economic growth to create a stronger economy and a stable growth environment."
"Do you have specific proposals with regard to the public/private partnerships and how they can be utilised outside of the Stability and Growth Pact to benefit trans-European networks?"
"I can say, Mr Crowley, that this is a subject that is obviously being studied."
"As you mentioned, we included this clear reference in the decision of the recent European Council last week, and, clearly, we are in the process of looking into how to make this mechanism compatible with the Stability Pact, which is confirmed as a founding principle."
"As Mr Prodi said this morning, the Commission is carrying out a comprehensive study with a view to the presentation, for the December European Council, of a specific and well-constructed plan, which will also include a recommendation for the immediate launch of the trans-European infrastructure."
"– Mr President, I would actually be interested to know how things currently stand with the timetable for the TENs."
"The financial package is now on the table."
"You have announced that the ministers are about to meet."
"When will the legal bases actually be created?"
"I can merely respond by saying that we have, of course, set ourselves a goal for the start of the actual programme."
"The start of the actual programme including the first appropriation of EUR 5 billion for what are known as the quick-start projects, will be approved by the December European Council."
"It is then, therefore, that we will, of course, also have the necessary legal framework."
"I can say that the Council is certainly aware of the trial and of the imprisonment of five Cuban citizens who have been resident in Florida since 2001 and is also aware of the concerns expressed by representatives of non-governmental organisations regarding the conditions in which they are being detained."
"The Council has not discussed the conditions of trial."
"As far as the more general stance of the Council and the Commission regarding Cuba is concerned, I would refer the Members who have tabled the questions to the debate that we held in this House at the beginning of September, because the conditions and stance have not changed"
"Thank you very much, Mr Frattini, for the speed and clarity of your reply."
"But, apart from thanking you for the information, the supplementary question I would like to put is as follows: when the sad and reprehensible death sentences – which we also condemn – were passed in Cuba by the Cuban Government and by Cuban courts, everybody criticised and condemned – including the European Council – that action by the Cuban Government; so why, in the situation where families of Cuban prisoners cannot see the prisoners imprisoned in Florida, which is a violation of all human rights, do you not behave in the same way as in the case in March and concern yourselves with human rights, whoever is suffering these deprivations and violations of human rights?"
"Mr Marset Campos, I can only say that I am not expressing – and I do not intend to express my personal opinion here."
"I can confirm that the Council, although aware of the situation, decided not to examine or address the conditions or the situation relating to this trial."
"This is how things stand."
"On the other hand, however, as regards the violation of human rights and the sentences that have been inflicted by the Cuban Government, the European Union has, as you are aware, expressed a specific position unanimously and with the support of Parliament."
"This is the state of affairs."
"I will, of course, make a note of your concerns and the measures that you have called for, which I will, of course, forward as you worded them."
"We learn that the Council knows about but has not examined the conditions of the trial."
"We also know that the Council has been paying special attention to the fact that the Cuban courts have sentenced about 70 United States agents."
"What will the President-in-Office reply if he is accused, not him but the Council, because he is replying on behalf of the Council, of unbridled hypocrisy, of having two sets of weights and measures and of the fact that the European Union outdoes the United States in its aggression towards socialist Cuba?"
"What will he reply if someone accuses the Council of what we openly accuse the European Union of?"
"Mr Frattini, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure I am going to give the floor to the three people; three minutes and then we will end the sitting."
"My colleague Mr Alyssandrakis has raised the issue."
"I have no further question; I am satisfied with this."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the question I would like to ask you is this: I had occasion to speak to the mother of one of the prisoners and the wife of another."
"Both women had been denied permission to visit these men."
"The prisoners are allowed no contact with their families. I would ask you, is this not a violation of the Convention on Human Rights, in your opinion?"
"Do you not feel that the European Union and the Council are currently applying double standards?"
"I believe it is time to take up a clear position condemning this aspect of the policy of this United States administration."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask whether human rights are universal or whether they only apply to certain countries."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 17 to 33 will be replied to in writing (1)."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council"
"Mr President, we must take note of the fact that this is a very serious and unambiguous report, which is indicative of an extremely European and, I would say, age-old culture: Monaco culture, Vichy culture, Mussolini culture, the culture of the Jerusalem Mufti."
"This is the respectable culture that is represented here."
"There are some interesting points that I want to mention in the minute and a half that I have left, and I quote: ‘[‘The current disturbing situation in Iraq is a further factor of destabilisation in the Middle East, which makes even more urgent and necessary a concrete perspective of peace… Alas…’] Alas, Mr Menéndez del Valle, of course, you are an orphan of Saddam Hussein!"
"The Middle East was more stable then, but let us move on."
"It is an interesting fact that, after three years of , 60% of Palestinians live on less than two dollars per day."
"Two dollars per day, Mr Menéndez del Valle, is what your CAP, your Europe, gives to any four-legged creature born between Finland and southern Sicily."
"Here, however, you are offering peace: not work, nor even dignity."
"The UNDP, which does have some knowledge of the matter, has raised a problem: the right to democracy."
"The Israeli people choose; you do not like their choices, and I do not like them either, but do you want to take them away from them?"
"We want democracy for the Palestinians, but for which ones? You want immediate elections, like those in Cambodia, which you, to your shame, applauded, and now there are murders, as we predicted."
"I am sorry, Mr President, for having taken a second or two too long, but I know, and not from today, that I am working in a parliament that descends directly in line from Vichy, with a faint echo of the parliaments of the European Far East: you know which ones I am alluding to."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Liikanen and the rapporteurs for their contributions."
"It takes some courage to say there is a very serious risk of de-industrialisation."
"The desire to build a powerful industry was at the heart of the ECSC and then of the European Economic Community. But we have not had an industrial policy for more than ten years now."
"How can we fail to question a profoundly biased position, which sets the creation of the single market against the role of the State, horizontal action against sectoral action?"
"Each of our Member States is managing its restructuring as it is able. There is no desire to promote the European productive system as a whole."
"It will be impossible for European growth to recover without boosting industry. It would, moreover, be foolish to count on services alone, because it is innovation and productivity, in industry and around it, that create the added value necessary for services to grow."
"If national policies continue to diverge, Europe will be incapable of being a base camp for our enterprises in globalisation and the challenge of competitiveness will be lost. So I am for entrepreneurship, without a doubt, but I think enterprise can only develop if we create the collective conditions for growth in Europe."
"Finally, it is good to measure the effects before legislating, but we must not over-regulate either."
"The important thing now is to try to build European leaders that will be the foundations for sustainable development."
"I will end with a word about method."
"This recovery will not be possible without involvement and I therefore call for a strategic dialogue between both sides of industry, public authorities and the Community institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we need an industrial policy in Europe, but an industrial policy that looks to the future, a green industrial policy."
"The Greens are grateful to Mrs Zrihen for reminding us that Europe used to be based on three pillars: environmental, social and economic."
"We find that quite a number of our conservative friends, some liberals and unfortunately also some socialists are forgetting, or are trying to forget, Gothenburg and the need to include the environment."
"We cannot go back to the scientism of the 1960s and industrial policies that included no risk assessment or ecology, which are the very foundation of the twenty-first century."
"That is why, as Greens, we want a better targeted research policy and are very much looking forward, impatiently, to the DG Environment’s document on environmental technologies, which has been promised for December, because environmental technologies are one of the responses to future world markets."
"Another thing we need is social cohesion."
"One point on which there really is a dividing line in our Assembly is that some believe that creativeness can be created by confusing a large proportion of European citizens. As Greens, we believe that Europe’s strength lies in its fabric and its social cohesion: we have to preserve that."
"Another thing we must maintain and develop is the non-market sector."
"It is absolutely clear that the market sector rests on the non-market and that Europe lacks a non-market policy in areas like education, infrastructure and creativeness."
"Finally, world trade policy. I think that with India, China and Russia we are witnessing a new momentum in world politics: these are countries with a very good level of education."
"They are therefore going to have engineers, but for decades they will be paid much less than ours. How are we going to deal with this reality in a world where we give priority only to competition instead of partnerships?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, implementing the Lisbon strategy with a view to improving the competitiveness of our companies is a key element in terms of relaunching the economy and preserving the European social model."
"Achieving this objective requires the existence of a broad and dynamic company fabric essentially composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, since these are best suited to the challenges of an environment which is constantly mutating and thereby responding to the concerns of the citizens in relation to employment."
"In order to guarantee the maintenance of this fabric, it is not sufficient, however, to guarantee the smooth operation, for example, of the internal market, or to implement a commercial policy which ensures the opening up of third country markets in a reciprocal fashion, or to implement an industrial policy which takes account of the specific needs of the different sectors, however important all this may be."
"In this regard, Commissioner, please allow me to express my satisfaction at your announcement of a forthcoming communication on the textile and clothing sector."
"As well as all these aspects I have referred to, we must also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit and promote the creation of companies and a favourable climate which allows them to develop and grow; without companies there can be no entrepreneurial fabric."
"Hence the timeliness of the Commission's Green Paper and the Langen report, which is the subject of this debate, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent work."
"We must reaffirm the importance and value of small and medium-sized businesses as a basic pillar of the European economy and promote the establishment of an environment which guarantees the appropriate training of entrepreneurs, stimulates the creation of companies, promotes their growth, their competitiveness and eliminates the legislative, administrative and fiscal obstacles which hinder entrepreneurial activity in line with the very appropriate proposals in the Langen report."
"Otherwise, the Lisbon objectives, which – let us not forget – should lead to the creation, between now and 2010, of 15 million jobs and greater social cohesion, will be reduced to mere wishes that are impossible to achieve."
"Finally, the spirit that drives entrepreneurs, large or small, is given a definition that will enable measures to be put in place to simplify the red tape involved in the creation and operation of businesses, their transfer and the essential forms of tax relief. There is, however, still much to be done, like drawing up a European specification for businesses, better representation for SMEs in Community think tanks, aid mechanisms for their internationalisation, etc. and I expect our work will continue in this direction."
"Mr President, I believe it is true to say that there is little that matters to citizens as much as feeling safe and secure in the country in which they live or reside. There is no point at all in us promoting the free movement of workers across the European Union if our citizens do not feel that they will be protected from crime in whatever state they may find themselves."
"To be a victim of a crime is bad enough, but the problems of personal and emotional torture will continue if they do not get fair and appropriate compensation. This is all the more important when we know that the legal systems vary from one country to another, and the ways and workings of the different police forces and the actions they take are not the same from one country to the next."
"I applaud this proposal. I believe it will provide a central body in citizens' own Member States, which would apply to the country where the crime occurred to get compensation on their behalf."
"We should not forget that violent crime can take place anywhere, in any country. It is right and proper that we do everything to level out the system to make certain it works in favour of the citizen and the victim of the crime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Evans for his report. I think it is an important initiative of the Greek Presidency, as has been stated by various fellow MEPs."
"It is too dreadful for words to be faced with the trafficking of human beings, including women and children, with the intention of removing their organs. These are invariably poor and powerless people from poor countries, but also from China and India."
"It is a good thing that this will be regulated. In this context, it is actually a disgrace that the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of 1997, which entered into force in 1999, has to date been ratified only by Denmark, Spain and Portugal."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is of the opinion that it is only by adopting a coordinated and tailored approach to the illegal trade in organs that human dignity can be protected."
"We therefore hope that this proposal will contribute to this."
"It is for these reasons that we support the proposal."
"Mr President, the transplantation of organs, parts of organs, tissues and cells, can save lives and is an important method in courses of treatment for many different disorders and illnesses. In future, the transplantation of cells, for example, will play an ever more important role in regular medicine."
"The first is the guarantee of quality and safety of donation and transplantation, and the second is the prevention of trade in organs, tissues and cells. The former is currently being dealt with in the Liese report, the latter in the report we are discussing today, which, to put it briefly, receives our unqualified support."
"Mr President, on 17 October, the Brussels European Council included in its conclusions a statement on Bolivia containing four points."
"This statement said, amongst other things, that the European Council reiterated its support for the democratically-elected government of Bolivia in its efforts to find a peaceful and constitutional solution to the current crisis and added that the European Council called on the political, social and economic forces in Bolivia to renounce violence and begin a responsible and constructive dialogue with the Bolivian Government."
"This was said at a time when, as Commissioner Vitorino himself has acknowledged, the Bolivian Government had been responsible for the deaths of more than eighty citizens and for injuries to hundreds of people and material damage to their property. At that time I was ashamed to read that the European Union, together with the US Government, was one of the few sources of support left to the President who acted in such an irresponsible way, after having tried to appropriate the country’s scant natural resources."
"The question I would ask the Presidency, represented by the Commission at the moment, and I am not sure whether it will be able to answer, is what kind of information the European Council had when adopting this statement, given that on that same day, before it had been possible to translate the Council’s statement into Spanish, the President of Bolivia was delivering his letter of resignation to the Bolivian National Congress. What type of representation do we have?"
"Is there no communication between the Commission and the Council? Did the Commission not know what was happening?"
"How could the Council have adopted this statement without the support of the Commission? In other words, we cannot act in such an irresponsible manner, because in this case the European Union has made a fool of itself."
"It has made a fool of itself before the public and – I repeat – I was ashamed to read in the newspapers that we were supporting this statement, together with the United States. But the Americans behaved more intelligently, because, when they saw that things were going badly, before 17 October, they told Sánchez de Lozada to go."
"Mr President, I apologise for taking such a critical tone, but I really feel hugely indignant at the moment, because it is not acceptable for our Union to be supporting this type of policy. I would like to add that I agree with Mr Salafranca that this is a time to stay calm, to support the new Bolivian Government, to do everything possible to ensure that this government succeeds, and I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information he has given me on emergency aid."
"Millions of country people are living in misery. The situation is truly horrendous and I believe that that country needs a very particular form of help, and we should avoid repeating past mistakes."
"We must not rob these poor people of the only natural resource remaining to them, having first taken silver from Bolivia and then tin."
". – Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking Mrs Stihler, for her report."
"On Monday, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its new scientific recommendation for 2004 and has now, unfortunately, been obliged to confirm the disastrous state that cod stocks are in, including in the waters to the west of Scotland, in the eastern English Channel, in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat."
"ICES has now advised that fishing for these four stocks be closed down."
"This, of course, puts us in a massive dilemma."
"Can we justify basing our decision solely on ICES’ argument in favour of replenishing stocks, which would result in our having to prohibit not only fishing for cod, but also for a whole range of other fish, and, in due course, in thousands of fishermen facing oblivion?"
"Or could we find a way out by improving our plans for stock recovery, so that, although stocks would recover more slowly and would also involve some elements of uncertainty, fewer fishermen would be forced to abandon their trade?"
"This is certainly a difficult decision, but it is one we will have to take before we can adopt any kind of plan to replenish cod stocks."
"The outline that we are debating today is a general one, and serves as a good basis for a cod stock recovery plan that would secure us the chance to revert to normal management conditions."
"It starts by identifying the lower limit below which scientists regard a stock as threatened with collapse."
"The plan contains formulae for calculating total allowable catches (TAC) on the basis of scientific estimates of current stocks."
"If the stock is larger than the lower limit, the TAC will be set in such a way that the stock can increase by 30% in the following year."
"It introduces limitations on the fishing effort, allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod."
"It also contains measures to improve the monitoring and control of the vessels whose fishing effort is subject to management measures; these include provisions on prior notification and on the requirement to land cod in designated ports."
". Mr President, the issue of cod stock recovery is an important one."
"It affects not only my own country of Scotland, but also the rest of the UK, Ireland and Denmark."
"Last week, the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) warned us that young North Sea cod measured in early 2003 were at their lowest level in 20 years."
"Worries over repeating what happened in Newfoundland, where the cod never returned, haunt us all, and the ICES advice is stark: 'These cod stocks are at such a low level that we have had to resort to recommending zero catches as a final line in the sand'."
"Zero catches means no fishing in the North Sea."
"The Commission's proposal sets out a package of measures which, if followed, is believed to allow the safe recovery of this valuable stock within five to ten years."
"The Commission is not alone in this objective."
"Yesterday's cod recovery proposal from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation also stated that: 'restoring cod to its historic level of abundance remains an important objective for fishermen, since a revitalised cod fishery would transform the economics of the whole demersal fishery'."
"The Commission proposal attempts to achieve an absolute minimum size of stock, sets guidelines for setting total allowable catches (TACs), introduces fishing limitation through Kilowatt days and deals with the monitoring, inspection and control side of fisheries management"
"As rapporteur, I have tried to say to the Commission that all action must be taken to recover stocks."
"We cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach across the areas covered by the plan."
"We need a flexible approach based on scientific assessment allowing fishing to continue for other species."
"Where it can be proved that fishing for other species in a particular area does not adversely affect cod recovery, fisheries should continue to be allowed and the concept of spatial management needs to be fully investigated."
"On research, we need to look seriously at the interaction of cod and other commercial fish species such as haddock and whiting."
"This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists."
"The impact of industrial fisheries also requires a thorough investigation."
"We constantly receive mixed messages on this issue and we need clarity."
"Regional advisory councils are vital to the future of a sustainable EU fishing policy."
"If we are going to be successful in our objectives of cod recovery, we must work with fishermen."
"I was happy to see this week's Commission proposal providing a blueprint for these regional advisory councils and how they would work, with two thirds of the membership of these new organisations coming from those active in the fisheries sector."
"I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry."
"On the socio-economic impact of these measures, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough."
"Some of the communities most directly affected are in remote areas truly on the periphery of the European Union."
"Parliament has already recognised the importance of the socio-economic issues in its resolution of March 2003."
"To be fair, so too have some of the Member States."
"The Scottish Executive has given GBP 50 million, with GBP 40 million for decommissioning and GBP 10 million for the direct socio-economic impact."
"However, we have to be very clear that it is up to national and regional authorities to take up the possibilities available to them in assisting the sector during this difficult time."
"I would like to see Member States carrying out socio-economic impact assessments on the recovery plan."
"On the basis of these reports, we would better be able to assess the problems and to mitigate any negative effects."
"I would like to see Member States having these in place one year after the implementation of this programme."
"On fishing effort limitation, the principle of proportionality must apply."
"The reference period used must take into consideration the pain the industry has already suffered through any decommissioning process."
"On inspection control, we need to extend satellite vessel monitoring, as suggested by the House of Lords report of May 2003."
"It seems a sensible measure and I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to come forward with a separate proposal on satellite monitoring."
"In conclusion, the revised cod recovery plan will be painful for the fishing industry and dependent communities."
"There is no point inflicting a lesser degree of pain or indeed any suffering at all if the measures implemented do not bring about the desired result."
"Yet, if stock recovery is not achieved, the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship in any event."
"Successful recovery of the stock must be the priority."
"What is needed is a package of measures which is both effective and minimises the pain to the sector."
"Mr President, I appreciate the Commission’s proposed recovery plan for depleted cod stocks."
"It means that the Commission is complying with its commitments under the common fisheries policy."
"I also appreciate Mrs Stihler’s work and her report, together with the cooperation that she and I have enjoyed, in my case as draftsmanof the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"That committee’s amendment according to which the precautionary principle would lead to drastic measures being taken and to the Member States having the opportunity to take measures in addition to the common ones in order to protect and preserve stocks has been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, and that is something I am pleased about."
"As we heard earlier, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) will tomorrow present its annual report on the fish stocks in our oceans."
"Again, a total moratorium is recommended, which should make the doubters realise that measures really must be taken."
"We know that the Council, which can no longer put its head in the sand, must take action and adopt this plan."
"It is the fourth version that the Commission is presenting to the Council."
"Even though I am satisfied with the Commission’s proposal and believe that it is a move in the right direction, I should also like to have seen the Baltic Sea included, because we know that cod stocks are just as threatened there."
"The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission has, moreover, come up with further plans, which sounded quite good in October."
"I therefore withdrew my amendments concerning the Baltic Sea in the Committee on Fisheries."
"At a later meeting in October, the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission deviated from its own principles concerning what should be done. It is completely ignoring the scientific advice and states that the catch is 45% larger than what international advisers claim."
"That is very serious."
"Not taking the measures recommended by the international advisers is a waste of fisheries resources."
"The advisers consist of 1 600 researchers from 19 countries, and not listening to these researchers constitutes a waste of what could be flourishing fishing communities and a flourishing industry."
"In the Baltic Sea, we could have fished three times as much as we are doing today."
"Take a genuinely sound decision here in the House now, as I hope will also be done by the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report and thank her for her hard work on this highly controversial issue."
"As we have heard once again, the ICES has stated that cod stocks are in such a dire state of collapse that it is recommending the complete closure of the cod fishery in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the West of Scotland."
"It claims that years of stringent conservation measures have failed to rebuild stocks and that only the total shutdown of these fishing grounds will enable any meaningful recovery."
"Of course, we know from bitter experience, that when the scientists once again call for the complete closure of the cod fishery, they also mean the virtual closure of the haddock, whiting, plaice and prawn fisheries, where cod is caught as a by-catch."
"Let me say this now to Commissioner Fischler and say it very clearly, because if there are any more cuts at the December Council meeting this year, it will spell the end of the UK white fish fleet."
"And I do not mean any more drastic cuts like last year, I mean any more cuts at all."
"The two previous massive decommissioning rounds have reduced the British white fish fleet by around 40%."
"The harbour workers and ancillary staff who rely on the white fish fleet for a living are now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy."
"Any further cuts will be fatal."
"It would mean that, even if cod stocks ever do recover, there will be no UK fishermen there to catch them."
"I do not intend to attack the scientists."
"There is nothing to be gained from shooting the messenger, but this most recent ICES report once again highlights the vital importance of listening to the advice of the fishermen as well as to the boffins."
"Last year scientists told us that haddock stocks were dwindling."
"The fishermen said this was rubbish."
"Now the scientists agree that there are an estimated 400 000 tonnes of haddock spawning stock biomass in the North Sea."
"So who is right?"
"Could I in addition say that it appears the scientists are not listening to each other when arriving at their grand conclusions."
"According to new scientific research from the respected Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation in Plymouth, which has been monitoring the North Sea for the last 70 years, stocks of cold water plankton, on which cod larvae feed, have been driven hundreds of miles to the north by an unprecedented rise in water temperatures."
"This perhaps explains why there is a great abundance of cod being caught around the Faeroes, Iceland and Norway, but none left in the North Sea."
"So for heaven's sake, let us start listening to the fishermen as well as the scientists."
"The fishermen have a vested commercial interest in seeing cod stocks recover."
"That is the only way we are going to get a decent living for our fishermen in the future."
"– Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is glad that finally the Commission, in accordance with Parliament’s request, is presenting a specific recovery plan for cod, separate from the recovery plan for hake, since, as we have always maintained, the situations of the respective stocks differ considerably."
"As the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, points out, for three years the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has been saying that the cod populations in the North Sea and off the west of Scotland are in serious danger of total collapse."
"The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that, on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions, we can implement recovery plans, which may or may not involve drastic measures which – we must not forget – always lead to the scrapping of ships, unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector, and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing."
"We therefore believe that the precautionary approach must be a residual criterion to be taken into account only when reliable and safe scientific opinions are not available, but under no circumstances must it replace these scientific opinions."
"The fishing communities, as Mr Stevenson said a moment ago, demand a clear position, on the part of both the Commission and Parliament, in favour of prior, safe and well-founded scientific opinions, which take account of the sector’s opinions and which, as well as the state of resources, calculate and evaluate the socio-economic consequences of the conservation measures, and we have been asking the Commission for this for a long time."
"Over-fishing is a determining factor, but it is not the only cause of the problem of scarcity of resources."
"Knowing the causes is essential if we want the recovery plans – this plan for cod and other future ones – to achieve their objectives, since if we restrict ourselves to reducing catches without tackling causes other than over-fishing – and I would mention the disruption of the food chain or sea pollution – we will perhaps find that the years will have passed and fish populations will not have increased."
"We need to ascertain the effects on the cod populations in the Irish Sea and the North Sea of the extraction of more than a million tonnes of fish of species other than cod, but which are, however, a source of food for cod."
"We also need to know the impact of industrial fishing on other populations of white fish, because that may perhaps provide the key to explaining the decline of cod and hake."
"We want the Commission to investigate the causes of this collapse of the species. We support the idea of a recovery plan which makes it possible to re-establish the stock and my group therefore supports the idea that the highest annual change, upwards or downwards, in any total allowable catch (TAC), should not exceed 15% after the first year of application of the recovery plan."
"Mr President, I begin by endorsing the points that colleagues have already made."
"I would say that Mrs Stihler's very clear and comprehensive report improves on the Commission's proposal in three major respects."
"Firstly, it introduces greater flexibility by allowing amendments to the geographical areas covered and by providing for additional Kilowatt days in response to appropriate technical measures."
"Secondly, it calls for certain reports."
"These are variously on the effects of industrial fishing, on the socio-economic impact of the regulation and on how far the regulation itself is achieving its objectives."
"Thirdly, it seeks the close involvement of regional advisory councils."
"The Commission's recent announcement of its proposal for establishing such bodies is welcome and we look forward to speedy progress in this regard."
"These measures, together with the emphasis on constraints on fishing effort being proportionate between the Member States and on improved satellite monitoring, are essential if our beleaguered fishing communities are to engage with the regulation in any positive way."
"We must, however, look beyond the regulation to other means of helping cod recovery and of moving to sustainable fisheries overall."
"The Scottish Fishermen's Federation's proposals for spatial management deserve serious consideration in this regard."
"Although the Scots are hardest hit, the impact is much wider, including the Irish, Danish and the Dutch, and we can learn from each other."
"One example is the self-monitoring currently practised by the latter."
"This again goes to show just how important a role regional advisory councils can play."
"I hope that the House will support this report, which seeks to make the regulation far less of a blunt instrument than that fashioned by the original proposal."
"Mr President, my group supports the Commission's proposals."
"It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing."
"Like many other species, stocks are far below sustainable levels, and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities."
"People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse."
"The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem."
"If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems, instead of going at it in the opposite direction."
"There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high, and, basically scientific advice has not been followed."
"The Council has asked for a proposal for a recovery plan, which the Commission proposed in 2001, but the Council still does not seem to have the courage to adopt it."
"This is the fourth attempt."
"The proposal has many good ideas including: outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted; rules for deciding about fishing, given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort."
"The ICES press release of Monday, which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned, shows that stocks are in grave danger."
"This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas, but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing."
"Last year, several TACs were set higher than ICES advised."
"The extreme example is the Irish Sea, with TACs set on average 28% above scientific advice over the past ten years."
"Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble?"
"ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand, but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands, and this is the problem."
"Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board."
"It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002."
"There have been some advances, such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation, in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential."
"But it is not all good."
"The MAGPs, which we will come back to later today, have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction."
"This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement."
"The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things, and the Greens will, as usual, support the Commission."
"However, there is a crucial level for the survival of the stocks."
"But in the Irish Sea the Commission's proposal would allow fishing below a stock level of 6000 tonnes, whereas ICES is now advising closure until stocks reach that level."
"It is vital that the Commission reflects ICES advice when recommending TACs for the next year on these stocks."
"We can no longer ignore ICES."
"Mrs Stihler has mentioned the situation in Canada."
"That will happen here if we do not take a progressive position."
"Mr President, I take the opportunity offered by the Stihler report to remind the House that the common fisheries policy has evolved greatly over the last 20 years and is now a fully-fledged Community policy with specific objectives."
"However, the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP."
"In the conclusions of the Convention, fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy, instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence."
"I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this, by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty."
"This is something that will not unravel anything, nor will it upset balances in the final outcome."
"There is still time for this to be done."
"'Where there is a will there is a way'."
"I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report, which supports the main thrust of the Commission's plans, as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation."
"Like Mrs Stihler, however, I believe there must be greater flexibility."
"There must be far greater local participation in these decisions."
"Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts."
"I say to the Commission: questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme."
"Commissioner, will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal?"
"That is what my fishermen and fishermen from the remote communities of the periphery of Europe want to hear from you."
"Why is it that the least culpable are bearing the brunt of these proposals and other proposals that emanate in the name of conservation?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, if we are to prevent North Sea cod from disappearing completely, a ‘save the cod’ campaign is urgently required."
"The question is how."
"In its definitive recovery plan for cod, the Commission introduces an effort limitation system."
"This system has already been proving its worth in the Netherlands for a long time in the form of the ‘days at sea’ system, a system that enables effective control of fishing pressure."
"Nevertheless, the plan also has the inevitable drawbacks."
"It only applies to vessels over ten metres in length, even though shorter vessels do play a part in cod fishing."
"The same goes for sport fishing."
"Industrial fishing, which regularly makes large by-catches of cod, is even left virtually untouched."
"The proportionality of the measures to be taken is unclear."
"The recovery plan should be less of a hindrance to the activities of fishermen whose by-catches of cod are small than to those of fishermen whose contribution to the problem is comparatively great."
"Incidentally, the impact of the various types of fishing can only be gauged accurately if the discards, too, are landed."
"There is no proposal to do this."
"Mr President, it is fortunate that the Commission has finally come around to the idea of separating cod and hake, having initially intended to deal with the two species under the same recovery plan, which would not have allowed for an understanding of the characteristics specific to each of these two stocks."
"The extremely drastic action that the Commission proposes for the long term – five to ten years – is based on a particularly alarmist diagnosis made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)."
"Two types of consideration cast a serious shadow, however, over the scientific rigour and objectivity of this analysis."
"The first is the failure to take account of the realistic observations made by the professionals, who claim that there has been a geographical shift of cod towards the northern part of the North Sea. This migration is attributed to the significant and undisputed warming of the waters."
"Scientists have failed to study this phenomenon and instead concentrate solely on the size of fishermen’s catches."
"This is a widespread problem, which affects the entire common fisheries policy (CFP) and it is fortunate that the Committee on Fisheries has asked the Scientific and Technological Assessment (STOA), at my behest, to provide us with information on the effects of global warming on fish stocks."
"This inadequate credibility of scientific opinion is also a matter of concern to the Council, which has just decided to allocate more substantial appropriations to improving it."
"This failure to take account of the views of fishermen also highlights the lack of appropriate coordination between the two sources of information, the scientific and the professional."
"This is another major flaw in the CFP, and this is also acknowledged by the Commission, which wants the future transnational regional advisory councils to be the forum in which these two categories of data will be addressed jointly."
"When the quality of data is inadequate, we know full well what happens: the scientists take refuge behind the precautionary principle, by interpreting it in the broadest possible way, and the Commission tries do outdo it, each party protecting itself as comprehensively as possible."
"The second consideration that makes one wonder about the quality of the ICES’ evaluations is their systematic exoneration of any significant effects of industrial fisheries on cod stocks."
"It is strange to say the least, that the ICES talks about profit and losses for a type of fisheries that clearly has a significant effect, given the tonnage caught and the nature of targets, on cod stocks."
"Our rapporteur does address this point but far too cautiously."
"I suppose it is a start, though."
"This was, incidentally, almost the only point on which the report diverges slightly from the Commission’s original proposals because it confines itself basically to supporting them as they stand, without subjecting them to any form of critical analysis and without proposing any changes."
"We are somewhat surprised that a parliamentary report should say so little about the genuine suffering felt by the communities that will be hard hit by this plan, communities that we represent."
"The fishing professionals concerned are particularly concerned at the implementation of the new instrument provided for in the reform of the CFP, which is to reduce the fishing effort."
"This essential point should have been debated at length and questioned in this Chamber, because what we have here is an archetypal recovery plan, which will become increasingly widespread."
"The fact that it is replacing a bad, expensive and ineffective instrument does not make the fishing effort a good instrument."
"The Commission intends to implement this measure before it has convincingly demonstrated its relevance and feasibility."
"It is extremely worrying that calculating reductions in the fishing effort should lead in practice to writing off examples of exceeding quotas, illegal catches and ‘black fish’, to the detriment of those who have stuck to their quotas."
"This process, Mr President, is not undermined in the slightest by the report, to which we cannot, consequently, give our support."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission finally accepted the proposal we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats made to the effect that hake and cod should be dealt with separately and in different proposals, since their situations are not just slightly different, but very different."
"We are glad about this and we are also happy with the report, on which we congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, despite the fact that originally she opposed our amendments to differentiate between the two species."
"Time has proved us to be right."
"Recovery plans are very delicate and serious issues, which must be approached with recourse to the greatest possible scientific knowledge and with the greatest possible support from the sector involved as well, given their significant socio-economic impact."
"Without the participation of scientists and fishermen, either directly or by means of the regional advisory councils, as proposed in the report, it is not possible to make a real, credible and transparent proposal, which is not only valid for cod, but for any other species or sector involved, as in the case of hake, whose sector we expect to hear soon in our committee."
"We support the consultation and we would also like to call on the European Commission to adapt the current Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural funds in the fisheries sector, so that the recovery plans are always accompanied by socio-economic measures cofinanced by the European Union in order to alleviate the negative consequences of the adoption of these recovery plans for the sector involved."
"This is the minimum we can ask for in order that the fishermen affected accept and comply with the plans laid down – whether they take place in Community or non-Community waters – whenever they affect European fleets, as in the recent case of the proposed recovery plan for halibut in NAFO waters."
"For all these cases, we must now provide for a general compensatory mechanism within the framework of the regulation I have mentioned, and we therefore call on Commissioner Fischler, for whose presence we are grateful, to make a proposal to Parliament in this regard."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Stevenson, Mrs Stihler, ladies and gentlemen, I would particularly like to ask Mrs Stihler and Mr Stevenson to pass on my profound expressions of sympathy to the fishermen of the Shetland Islands and of Scotland as a whole, as well as to fishermen in all the regions of Europe, in fact, which are directly affected by this tragedy."
"Our knowledge and experience to date, especially off Newfoundland, is not encouraging."
"Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that we have already passed the point of no return, the point beyond which not even the most radical measures will afford sustainable cod fishing in the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can only say to you that while we sympathise with the victims of this disaster, we must also draw the right conclusions from it."
"We must ensure that our biological resources are no longer decimated on the say-so of an irrational common fisheries policy, and that this tragedy never happens again anywhere else in Europe."
"Actively aided and abetted by the Commission, the Council has recently opened up most of the Azores Exclusive Economic Zone, and is now threatening to allow predatory fishing methods, including bottom trawling, throughout much of that Exclusive Economic Zone."
"That goes against the democratic will of this Parliament, and against the opinion of the scientific community all over Europe."
"By adopting this measure, the Commission has taken a step which might lead to a repeat of the tragedy we have witnessed in the North Sea, this time in those sections of the Central Atlantic Ridge that have up to now been successfully protected from depredation."
"We urgently need a new fisheries policy, therefore, that enshrines in Community law the conventions of international maritime law, the right to property as defined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the precautionary principle, always preached and never practised."
"We need a fisheries policy that does more than reel off obituaries in the aftermath of measures that neither permit nor encourage sustainable fishing."
"Mr President, once again we are debating this subject against a background of depression, fear and trepidation in fishing communities, particularly around Scotland, against a background of an almost total lack of confidence in the European Union's ability to manage fisheries at all."
"We would not be facing so many crises if European management had been a success, would we?"
"Who has a vested interest in restoring stocks to sustainable levels?"
"It is fishermen and fishing communities and only fishing communities."
"Why then is it continually the case that they feel that their views, their interests, and particularly their expertise, are ignored in management decision-making?"
"Looking from Scotland it is impossible to justify or to accept the apparent inequitability of management decisions of late."
"Scots are using the largest mesh sizes in all of the European Union and yet are taking the biggest catch cuts, while those using smaller meshes fare better."
"Once again, we have the threat of complete closure of haddock, whiting, prawn and other fisheries related to cod allegedly."
"Yet no mention of industrial fisheries which fish for non-human consumption being curtailed."
"I am considering voting against the Stihler report, not because I am against its content which after all was substantially shaped by amendments of mine that were accepted in committee, but in protest at the likelihood that the Commission will ignore it anyway."
"It has after all repeatedly pointed out that there is no legal obligation upon it to consult regional advisory councils."
"In any case there will not be one in time for a cod recovery plan to be adopted."
"We all know that the Council 's output on this subject will probably ignore our views as well."
"Member States are very often accused, even by the Commission, of ignoring the science in their determination to defend their national interest in the Council."
"I just wish that Scotland had a Member State government which would defend its national interest in the fisheries council."
"Last December the then UK Fisheries Minister continued a long tradition of actively voting against Scotland's interests in the Council of Ministers and the new Minister, who finally managed to get himself to Scotland this week, where 70% of the UK fisheries fleet is based, told fishing communities to get real – presumably asking them to accept that there will be more pain to come because he knows that he will do nothing to help."
"The social and economic pain being felt by families in Scotland's coastal communities is very real."
"They know the realities of recent decisions and their effects on them."
"It is totally unacceptable that the UK Government has absolutely no intention, yet again, of doing anything other than increasing that pain."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I have just been to Sicily with a fisheries delegation. There, too, I was frequently asked how best to deal with the serious danger to resources and the consequent threat of fishing being closed down."
"Today I believe that we politicians cannot generalise when answering questions like that."
"If I say no, that an endangered resource is not to be barred to fishing, I may have to reckon with the resource not lasting for long, so that only a short time now remains in which it can be used, the inevitable consequence of which is that the socio-economic situation will deteriorate."
"If, on the contrary, I say yes, and that the resource should be barred to fishing, this may well promote the replenishment of the stocks, but even then many jobs will be lost in the fisheries sector and in the businesses that depend on it, never to be replaced, and it may be that regions will lose expertise that will never return there."
"If we want to effectively counter the threats posed to resources, especially of cod – which are indeed grave – whilst also taking into account all the consequences of our actions, I am now more than ever convinced that our primary need is for a comprehensive strategy for developing coastal regions, which means concerted action, the political will to protect resources, a checklist to be completed and processed, which shall be binding upon all."
"What I have called a strategy must involve all the stakeholders: biologists, researchers into marine ecosystems, and environmental campaigners just as much as politicians in the localities, in the capitals and in Brussels, and, last but not least, the fishermen and the fish processing industry."
"All of them have to shoulder their share of responsibility."
"Just as I have called for there to be what is termed a chain of responsibility in the area of maritime accidents, so I demand that there should be one in this area too."
"I urge that this strategic concept now be taken further with action of this kind."
"All the information we have indicates that it is five minutes to midnight!"
"– Mr President, although they are issues which do not only affect cod, I would like to condemn the fact that several European fisheries regulations do not take account of the discrimination that Basque fishermen and fishermen from the Spanish state have been suffering since accession to the European Community."
"Today it is still intended to maintain this injustice by restricting their access to the so-called Irish Box, the intention being to redefine it as a sensitive area in the Irish Sea."
"I agree with looking after sensitive areas, but opportunities must be equal for all."
"Furthermore, for the calculation of the database which will serve as a reference for the future allocation of the permitted kilowatts per day of fishing capacity, account has not been taken of the temporary halts by our vessels in years past, voluntarily, in order to allow for the self recovery of fish species."
"Others did not stop, they used what they fished and now they are benefiting from it, taking account of those tonnes which they caught."
"It is now time for the Europe of freedom and of the common market to legislate equitably and for there not to be first-class and second-class fishermen."
"Mr President, I am sure the applause was not for the fact that I am about to speak."
"Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on her very timely report."
"No doubt we will all have the usual shoot-out just before Christmas on TACs and quotas and we can see the lead into that coming along."
"For a long time – in fact for as long as I can remember – there has been a problem with cod stocks and we seem unable to find a solution to it because all our efforts to date have quite clearly not succeeded."
"We are told by the scientists that everything that has happened to date has not worked."
"We are told by the fishermen that the scientists have got it wrong."
"As I have said before in this House, we are stuck in the middle trying to find out what is right and what is wrong."
"We have quite clearly not got it right to date, and I think we have to ask whether the scientists have got it right."
"Has what we have done to date achieved anything?"
"I have to ask you, Commissioner, because in Box 7a in the Irish Sea, where the fishermen of Northern Ireland fish, those spawning grounds have been closed for the last four or five years to allow the new larvae to come forward."
"What, according to the scientists, has that achieved?"
"Surely it should have achieved something or at least we should know if it has brought some response?"
"The recent ICES report will spell total disaster for the white fish industry in the United Kingdom as a whole and will certainly destroy the Northern Ireland fleet."
"I believe we need a more regional approach."
"I believe we need an input from the people at regional level and we need to look at other measures that will add to cod recovery."
"We have to look at what the effect will be on other species fishes."
"I realise it is not easy and I realise you have a very difficult problem, Mr Fischler."
"Yet the common fisheries policy does not make it easier and you cannot resolve this problem unless you get the fishermen on your side, That is what you must try to do, because they are central to this, they are part of it and they are going to suffer most from it."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report which deals with the Commission proposal to regulate the recovery of cod and hake stocks."
"This includes the areas of TACs, managing effort through days at sea – based on stocks size consistent with the precautionary principle – and of course Chapter 4, which most importantly deals with measures to police, monitor, inspect and survey the effort management system."
"All stakeholders must be intimately involved in a bottom-up approach if stock recovery is to be achieved."
"Always presuming in the first place that the scientists have been looking for the stock in the right areas."
"The whole area must be managed by the stakeholders through the regional advisory councils, if not, we will never bridge the deep divide that exists between fishermen and scientists at the moment."
"The proposed action plan, the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections."
"This must include the fishermen, national authorities and scientists, and the Figueiredo report later today will deal with that."
"As for last week's Fishery Council outcome on the Irish Box. Could you Commissioner, indicate clearly, on the record, how you will ensure there will be no increase in effort in the most sensitive southeast area of what was the Irish Box."
"This has now been excluded as a conservation area, with a serious reduction in the Irish Box which now is only to cover the southwest area."
"The ultimate goal has to be sustainable fisheries through regional management, by opening up the governance of the common fisheries policy and helping to overcome mistrust and scepticism."
"We urgently need integrated regional management of the Irish Sea fishery."
"The status quo is no longer an option."
"I commend the establishment of the Pan-Irish Sea Alliance and wish them every success in delivering results to their vulnerable coastal communities."
"I agree that we do not need, as other colleagues have said, first- and second-class fishermen."
"But unfortunately, with the quota management system under the common fisheries policy, it is exactly what we have: first- and second-class fishermen."
"Some will have to stay with their boats tied up watching fishermen from other nationalities fish their very shores."
"That is the prospect facing fishermen in the south and east of Ireland at the moment."
"– Mr President, first of all, I should like to compliment the rapporteur, my colleague Mrs Stihler, on her report."
"I also hope that her coming marathon, I think it is in New York, is just as successful as this report."
"The situation with cod fishing will then turn out well, too."
"The problem in relation to cod stocks is well known; only our approach to the problem keeps changing."
"On the one hand, the ICES is now suggesting that we should stop all fishing, and, on the other, Canadian biologists maintain that there is no point, that it will not lead to the recovery of cod stocks."
"That means that the problem is intractable and can only be solved if genuine constructive cooperation is achieved between the Commission, the regions and the fisheries sector."
"In that regard, it is extremely important that the efforts and involvement of fishermen, in particular, play a part in this."
"It is almost impossible to tackle this kind of problem except by giving fishermen’s producer organisations a strong position: joint management of quotas, trying together to reduce by-catches as much as possible, and also looking together at how to counter the consequences of fishing effort limitations."
"In that regard, it would be good if the Commission were to make a generous commitment of Structural Funds for the regions hit hard by a reduction in cod fishing."
"Perhaps those funds can be used to attract new employment to those regions."
"I should like to express my support once more for Mrs Stihler’s approach, and I hope that the Commission will take this report extremely seriously."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that the European Commission has for several months been launching a series of very important actions for the recovery of fisheries resources that are suffering serious deterioration."
"Until now the plans have focussed on cod and hake resources in the north and, although there will soon be other proposals affecting other stocks, such as hake in the south, today we are talking about the re-establishment of cod stocks."
"I believe, Commissioner, that there are certain elements missing from the Commission’s proposal."
"Firstly, the lack of instruments to confront the socio-economic impact of the plans for the recovery of fishing grounds."
"I would like to stress the consequences of recovery plans for coastal regions or areas dependent of fishing."
"Therefore, within a reasonable time period – no more than a year, naturally – the European Commission should present a report, accompanied by proposals to alleviate the social and economic repercussions of the measures adopted, on the basis of the information communicated by the Member States."
"Commissioner, it is not a question of failing to defend the recovery of stocks, but of defending the fishermen and their families."
"This week, the ICES published its latest opinion on the situation of stocks of various species and there is little optimism to be had from it."
"While the Commission should monitor the various scientific opinions, it is not sufficient to automatically accept this type of proposal with serious repercussions of many kinds – social, most importantly: we must call for the presentation of compensatory measures to prevent traumatic situations in the regions dependent on fisheries, for fishermen and for their families."
"Finally, I believe, and I will end here, Mr President, that the involvement of the sector must be the third essential requirement for the success of the proposals on the recovery of stocks."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having listened very attentively to the debate, I would like to point out to Mrs Doyle that now is perhaps not the time to discuss how we intend to implement the ‘Western Waters’ Regulation."
"There will be other opportunities to do that."
"I would like to respond to the questions raised by setting out the Commission’s position on the individual amendments."
"I am unable to accept Amendment No 1 on the grounds that drastic measures are called for, not by the precautionary approach, but by the fact that cod stocks are below biologically safe levels and are therefore threatened by collapse."
"I am, though, very much able to accept Amendment No 2, although I would suggest a clearer form of words indicating that the fishing effort should be constrained in proportion to the Member States’ catches."
"Amendment No 4 came as a surprise to me, since, as you are aware, I have called on the Member States, not once but repeatedly, to inform us of the socio-economic impact of the recovery plan."
"I also asked them to notify us of any additional financial requirements they might have."
"The Commission has, unfortunately, received no replies to these enquiries."
"I have also drawn the attention of the Member States to the fact that they can reprogram the funds in the FIFG in order to support the sector."
"None of them have availed themselves of this facility."
"Amendment No 5 is superfluous, as the Commission can, in any case, propose changes to the geographical areas in question."
"Turning to Amendment No 6, I have to tell you that these technical measures can, if need be, supplement restrictions on fishing effort, but cannot replace them."
"Amendment No 7 is superfluous, as, if fishing vessels are not on either List 1 or List 2, then they are not permitted to land catches of the species mentioned."
"The fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the list in Article 9."
"Amendment No 8 will not work, as the definition of ‘days absent from port’ must correspond with that laid down in other regulations."
"I do not think that Amendment No 9 is to the point, as satellite monitoring systems will be required to be installed on all vessels over 15 metres in length with effect from 2005."
"Although I have to reject Amendment No 11, I would at the same time like to point out that ICES is engaged in completing its ecosystem study on the influence of industrial fishing, and we will take appropriate account of any new knowledge that emerges from it."
"I can accept the first two paragraphs of Amendment No 12, but am obliged to reject the third."
"We cannot instruct the Member States to access any funds to cushion the socio-economic impact."
"Amendment No 13 is, I think, a very good one, as there is a need for the annual review of stocks that it proposes."
"I am obliged to reject Amendment No 14."
"No new definition of the tasks of the regional advisory councils is required as they are clearly laid down in the new Framework Regulation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote."
". Mr President, as was agreed at the budget conciliation meeting of 16 July, I should like to recall that Parliament will have to publish a table for the amounts of the EU-15 and for the EU-25 for each budget line."
"It is my understanding that you are willing to send a letter to the Council including that table."
"It will not, therefore, be necessary to include the table as an integral part of the resolution."
"Secondly, I have a technical correction to announce."
"In a number of amendments the incorrect budget line was entered due to information technology problems."
"This correction only enters the correct budget lines without obviously changing the content of the amendments."
"(1)"
"I also want to propose three oral amendments."
"On Amendment No 797 on the civil peace corps, I would propose to add the following remarks. “This appropriation is also intended to finance a feasibility study on the establishment of a European civil peace corps going beyond humanitarian aid .”"
"Amendment No 649 on budget line 070308 is to be modified as follows."
"The following remarks should are deleted: ""Part of the appropriation may be allocated to the European Academy of the Urban Environment in Berlin, with due regard for the provisions of the Financial Regulation""."
"Amendment No 754 on budget line 15060103 is modified as follows."
"The following remarks are added. ""EUR 150 000 is earmarked for a grant to the European Academy of the Urban Environment in Berlin"" and the figures are increased by the same amount and therefore by EUR 150 000."
". Mr President, Amendment No 709 may have to be adjusted technically to reflect the result of the vote today."
"This amendment aims at offsetting the cost of amendments adopted, so that Parliament remains within the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of Heading 5."
"A number of amendments rejected in the Committee on Budgets have been retabled and, if they are adopted, their cost will have to be offset by adjusting Amendment No 709 accordingly."
"That concludes the vote on the budget."
"I should like to place on record, on your behalf, our thanks to the services."
"Mr Dunstan and his colleagues stayed up until 3 a.m. to prepare that vote for us."
". – Mr President, if I am right in my understanding of this, it says here that we are allocating EUR 8.4 million to the political parties."
"It now appears from what the House has resolved that the line being marked ‘p.m.’, is a token entry."
"Voting on that now would go against what the plenary has already voted, and so I now ask whether that is actually the case."
". Mr President, Mr Walter is absolutely correct because, in the previous vote, we voted against the amendment to put the EUR 8.4 million in the reserve or on the line."
"We are therefore left with only a p.m., so we cannot retain the wording of the paragraph in its current form."
"On the advice of the rapporteur, this thus seems surplus to requirements in the light of earlier votes."
". Mr President, can I just make a small point because one or two colleagues have raised a question, albeit at the very last moment, about some of the terminology."
"The phrase 'illegal trafficking' is used or added to ensure – or we hope to ensure – linguistic clarity and to avoid any ambiguity."
"Once parts of human organs, blood and tissue are included in the report, it is necessary to ensure that any legal trade that exists in, for example, blood, sperm or human tissue, is not criminalised or penalised."
"There is no suggestion whatsoever that there should be any legal trade or trafficking in human organs – quite the opposite."
"That is the purpose of the report, and I hope it is now clear."
"(2)"
"– Mr President, under item 8, this document states that the Western Balkans do not form part of Europe, which is quite nonsensical."
"I would ask the rapporteur to clarify this, as I will not, otherwise, be able to vote in favour of the report."
"Do not tempt me at this hour of the day, Mr Posselt!"
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and also on his masterful silence, by way of contribution."
"(3)"
". Mr President, I am sorry but the fact is that technology is not always up to scratch here."
"I wanted to inform you, as regards Amendment No 8(2), that I propose to replace the words ‘all steps’ contained in the original text with the words ‘steps’."
"This would enable us to hold a joint vote."
". Mr President, as regards paragraph 11, I propose an oral amendment intended to replace the words ‘alternative energy sources’ with the words ‘renewable energy sources’."
"(4)"
"That concludes the votes.(5)"
"– Mr President, I regret that two amendments, which were very important in terms of sending a political message firstly to the textiles sector, which is very concerned about the challenges it has to face in 2005, and secondly, to industry in general, which also has great concerns in view of the entry of China into the WTO, have not been able to be adopted as a result of the lack of a qualified majority. They could have served, as I have said, as a political message to the sectors, which are very worried."
"I believe that all those who have voted against them have shown a lack of coherence."
"At the same time, I would also like to explain that I have voted in favour of an increase in the budget in relation to the reconstruction of Iraq, although I was at the time and continue to be totally against the war, because I believe that we cannot continue to punish the Iraqi people, particularly in view of the serious insufficiencies in basic services for the population which already existed."
". The European Parliament has, in its preliminary draft budget, once again approved an item ‘3710 – Contributions to European political parties’ – stated for the record."
"We have voted against this measure."
"For several years, our House has been itching to fund so-called ‘European’ political parties out of the public purse."
"This has been impossible, however, due to the lack of a legal base."
"The Treaty of Nice made a timely appearance on the scene and provided one (Article 191(4) TEC), but an implementing regulation is still required."
"This is not easy to draft, however, because it seeks to discriminate, in a very clumsy way, between the supposedly ‘integrationist’ political parties and the others, but also between the strictly European political parties and those that, from a national base, work at European level."
"It thereby runs counter to Article 191(4) of the Treaty, even as amended by Nice, which gives a broad definition of those who can benefit from funding, where it refers to parties ‘at European level’ – unlike what the current wording of item 3710 would have us believe."
"In order to overcome this new hurdle, the draft European Constitution makes yet another change: it subtly targets political parties ‘at’ European level (Article I(45)(4)."
"Unfortunately for the federalists, however, this text is still a long way from being adopted."
"The Danish Liberal Party’s Members of the European Parliament, Mr Busk and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, voted against Amendment No 338 in the vote on the EU budget for 2004."
"We think it is inappropriate to support tobacco production in Europe."
"Adoption of Amendment No 338 would, however, be nothing more than an empty gesture, since the EU would still be legally obliged to provide the aid."
"Instead, we believe it should be decided to remove the aid as part of an overall reform of the EU’s agricultural aid schemes."
"The reinstatement of the farming line and the significant effort envisaged for rural development must both be welcomed, unlike the unacceptable reduction in appropriations requested to the detriment of the tobacco sector, which is extremely fragile in terms of employment."
"In the international arena, the very serious situation in Iraq and the help to be provided for its long-suffering citizens and for its sorely tried infrastructures require some simple principles and ideas to be recalled."
"Foreign policy must remain under the sovereignty of nations."
"In the field of Union aid for the reconstruction of Iraq, the Council of Ministers, like the European Commission, has agreed to acknowledge that a sum of around EUR 200 million until the end of 2004 would provide the necessary and sufficient contribution to the reconstruction of the country, leaving food aid and emergency aid aside, in the knowledge incidentally, that Iraq’s absorption capacity, according to these institutions, is limited."
"Furthermore, in order to match the needs of the Iraqi people, the European Union’s contribution must be set against the background of a specific political agreement on the conditions for its implementation, with a key role being given to the United Nations."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that the House has nevertheless not agreed to the amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists aiming at cutting EUR 40 million for the export of live cattle."
"We, too, are opposed to export subsidies for the transport of live animals for slaughter, but this indiscriminate amendment, which did not distinguish between cattle for breeding or production and animals for slaughter, was lamentably inappropriate."
"Whilst I am very glad that a majority could not be found to support this amendment, I would like to make it clear that such amendments are detrimental to agriculture, particularly in less-favoured areas."
". This year too we are unable to accept the broad guidelines for the Community budget."
"The draft budget is all the more disturbing because it will apply, as of 1 May 2004, to a Europe of 25."
"This has led to a marked increase in the budget, with more than EUR 112 billion in commitment appropriations."
"The citizens of those Member States that contribute the most, however, such as France, will never see any of it."
"Instead, they will suffer as a result of the shortcomings of the CAP and of the way in which the overall allocation for structural operations has been changed."
"The Chasse- Pêche- Nature- Traditions (CPNT) members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD) believe that, instead of putting the French budget under its supervision, Europe would do better to put a brake on its own compulsive spending."
". The draft budget for 2004 confirms the trend towards reducing the size of the budget, in evidence since 1997."
"This draft budget is the equivalent of less than 1% of Community gross national income (GNI), despite the fact that it is the enlargement budget, with greater requirements in terms of social and economic cohesion, and despite the fact that the EU is experiencing an economic recession."
"Thanks to the acceptance of Agenda 2000, the restrictive financial framework of the Copenhagen Council and the consequences of the constraints imposed by the Stability Pact, which directly affect the implementation of the budget, the budgetary procedure has become a bargain basement where inconsequential issues are debated and where the policy pursued is one of transfers, cuts and redistribution of funds."
"All of this reduces budgetary transparency."
"We regret that the creation of a budget line of EUR 20 million for the reconstruction of Palestine has been rejected, given the deterioration in the living conditions and infrastructure of the people of Palestine."
"We do, however, welcome Parliament’s approval of our proposal requesting that the Commission maintain the level of funding for East Timor, bearing in mind the ongoing need for reconstruction in that country and the international undertakings signed with it."
"Reparation should, therefore, be made for the unjustifiable 70% cut proposed by the Commission, which has deleted the specific budget line for East Timor."
"I have, on 23 October 2003, voted in favour of the budget at the European Parliament’s first reading and in favour of Mr Mulder’s report (A5-0349/2003)."
"In that connection, I should like to emphasise that I am unable to support those parts of the budget concerning the Statute of Members and aid to the European political parties."
"Mr President, for most of this year the College of Quaestors, with the support of the Bureau, has been trying to amend the budget to extend the health insurance scheme to former Members as long as: they have served at least two terms in the European Parliament; are aged at least 60 when they leave the European Parliament; and the costs of the scheme will be shared in the same way as for Parliament's officials except that, additionally, former Members will pay a premium equivalent to roughly five years' contributions into the scheme."
"This will put this category of former Members in the same position as staff with the same length of service."
"In this multi-million euro budget, Miss Gill has sought to frustrate this modest and comparatively inexpensive scheme at every opportunity."
"Her attitude towards her ageing former colleagues has been cruel, vindictive and hypocritical."
"While she condemns them to a painful and sick old age she has no similar reservations regarding her own benefits."
"I challenge Miss Gill to tell us whether she makes use of Parliament's private health reimbursement scheme and whether or not she benefits from Parliament's voluntary pension scheme."
"Miss Gill's attitude has been and remains a disgrace."
"Even now I hope she will soften her attitude, but I fear I will hope in vain."
"I have, on 23 October 2003, voted in favour of the budget at the European Parliament’s first reading and in favour of Mrs Gill’s report (A5-0350/2003)."
"In that connection, I should like to emphasise that I am unable to support those parts of the budget concerning the Statute of Members and aid to the European political parties."
"I have, on 23 October 2003, voted in favour of the budget at the European Parliament’s first reading and in favour of Mrs Gill’s report (A5-0350/2003)."
"In that connection, I have supported the European Parliament’s purchasing the buildings in Strasbourg and Luxembourg, because this would in the longer term reduce the costs in connection with the ‘dual domicile’ and so save the European taxpayers’ money in the form of taxes."
"I should like to emphasise that I am still opposed to the European Parliament’s having two bases and that I am of the view that a purchase of the buildings would not affect the decision to allow the European Parliament to work and vote in the one place."
"That decision must be taken by the Heads of State and Government, whereupon it will, moreover, be possible for the buildings to be sold at a favourable price."
". The priorities of the Community’s criminal justice system have always been the perpetrators of crime and the handing down of punishments on the basis of the crime committed."
"Scant attention has been paid to the victims, who are subject to different national compensation systems which experience great difficulty in terms of coordination and enforcement in the specific case of cross-border crimes."
"It is important, then, to draw up minimum standards defining the terms ‘victim’ and ‘crime’, establishing which persons are eligible to benefit from compensation if the victim dies, and determining the methods and means of payment."
"To my mind, the rapporteur’s belief in the central importance of guaranteeing compensation is particularly impressive."
"This is crucial not only in order to alleviate the harm and suffering caused, as far as possible, but also to deal with the social conflict created by the crime and facilitate the application of a properly rational criminal policy."
"A society which supposedly safeguards individual rights should also make provisions for protecting its citizens at the level of the individual."
"I warmly congratulate the rapporteur on this magnificent piece of work."
"I voted in favour."
". We have abstained from the vote on this report, as we have on the two previous reports on fisheries."
"We are in favour of recovering the stocks of fish that are threatened with extinction."
"For years, however, European policy has focused on solely on performance, profit and sustainable development."
"As a result, the major fishing companies have overexploited stocks and plundered the spawning beds."
"This has brought enormous profits for shipowners and processing companies, whose cost prices have continued to fall."
"As fish stocks have decreased at the same pace, the authorities finally got worried and decided to reduce the size of fishing fleets."
"It is the small-scale fishermen who have paid the price and taxpayers too, since they have subsidised the aid so that the major shipowners continue to prosper, since the only ‘sustainable development’ taking place was that of their own profits."
"The measures envisaged by the European institutions or national States will consist of indecisive measures, which according to one report have been scuppered by the large shipowners with the complicity of the EU Member States, and measures whose main effect is to harm the communities that depend on fishing."
"We reject any measure that, on the pretext of preserving nature, destroys the livelihoods of the small-scale fishermen who survive on what they earn."
". As the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has indicated since the end of 2000, North Sea cod stocks are at serious risk of collapse."
"This is a grave threat to the environment and to the sustainability of resources, but also to those fishermen and sectors of the fleet involved in these catches."
"The December 2002 Council proposed a definitive recovery plan for these stocks, with a view to ensuring the safe recovery of the cod stocks to the precautionary stock sizes advised by scientists within a time frame of five to ten years."
"There must, on the other hand, be a balance between the operations planned, and the socio-economic consequences must be borne in mind."
"That calls for measures to reimburse the costs incurred by those sectors of the fleets and fishing regions that depend on these catches, as well as guarantees that the parties with the greatest interest in seeing stocks recover – fishermen, in other words – play a leading role."
"It should also be obvious that the requisite funding must be guaranteed for these measures, while the flexibility instrument needs to be mobilised, or the financial perspective reviewed."
". I welcome the report by my colleague, Mrs Stihler, which approves and improves the Commission proposal to deal with the serious decline in cod stocks in Community waters as identified by the ICES scientific report."
"The report accepts that urgent conservation measures are required but that these must be balanced with actions to protect the economic and social interests of fisherman and ancillary workers."
"Any ban on cod fishing should not be turned into a general ban on white fishing."
"While it is important that significant numbers of cod are not caught as a by-product of other white fishing, selectivity must be applied to areas excluded from general fishing in order to allow fishermen to catch species which are not in danger."
". The Commission’s proposal that a recovery plan be drawn up for cod stocks in the North Sea and surrounding waters comes in response to data suggesting that the stocks in question are on the brink of collapse."
"Fishing activity would decline as a result, thereby affecting fishing communities on the east, west and north coasts of Ireland, northern Scotland and the Scottish Northern and Western Isles."
"These areas are peripheral and highly vulnerable, since there is limited scope for diversifying the local economy, and access to markets is restricted."
"Consequently, since this report aims to balance the need to pursue its stated aims on the recovery of stocks with the socio-economic impact on the fisheries sector and the communities which depend so heavily on this industry, I could only support it."
"I believe that the report’s emphasis on flexibility and local participation – particularly, as the rapporteur also suggests, that of fishermen and regional advisory councils – in the recovery of stocks is crucial in this connection."
"Just as interesting is the call for a report to be drawn up on the impact of industrial fishing on cod stocks, which is still a controversial issue."
"Mr President, I am concerned."
"We were aware of the cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Strasbourg, but we are now seeing a particularly nasty outbreak of liberalism."
"I am referring to the Jarzembowski report and I am astonished that the vote went in favour of the rapid liberalisation not only of freight but also of passenger transport, despite the warnings of the Commission and the Council and despite the fact that most rail companies are not ready for such changes."
"We would be acting without having seen the evaluation asked for by the Commission and in the knowledge that this action will have significant consequences in terms of safety, social conditions and the quality of service provided to the citizens."
"I believe that Parliament has today voted quite irresponsibly and that it has been dictated to by national self-interest and by forthcoming elections. We have allowed election dates to influence our votes."
"– Mr President, although the Jarzembowski report is certainly a significant milestone on the way to a European rail market, I would like to say that we have, overall, a vast amount of catching-up to do in European railway policy, and wish to highlight above all the utter neglect of the lines connecting the east with the west and the west with the south-east."
"It is my belief that the unification of our continent, which is currently underway, makes the rail link running from Paris via Strasbourg and southern Germany to Vienna and Budapest, as well as the route from Stuttgart to Prague, of pre-eminent importance."
"Our discussions of railway policy give me the feeling that it is far from clear to many of those responsible that far more is at stake than whether or not this or that area is opened up to traffic; this is really about a great transport project called ‘European Unity’."
"What we have achieved to date is fragmentary at best, and I wish to appeal, above all to the Council, the governments and the Member States to make substantial funds available for railway policy."
"I believe that this is not only of paramount economic importance, but also that the unification of Europe as a whole cannot succeed unless we at last do massive extension work on the routes between east and west. Although these connect the most important regions of Central Europe with one another, it is unfortunate that they do not link up to most of the national capitals."
"It is for this reason that many states that focus on their own capital – Germany, for example – regard them as far too peripheral."
". – I voted against the proposal to expand the liberalisation of rail transport in Europe."
"Although the effects of directive 2001/12 on access rights to the Trans-European rail freight network could not be evaluated, because it is still being transposed in the Member States, the European Commission and Mr Jarzembowski propose to speed up the complete liberalisation of rail transport."
"It is simplistic to claim that the fall in rail’s competitiveness is due to its failure to open up."
"Passenger rail transport did not need to be opened up for competitive and safe rail lines to be built."
"Cooperation between operators works – at least where the Thalys is concerned."
"What Europe lacks is an industrial policy, closer cooperation between public service operators and the development of Member States’ and the Union’s budgets for investment in the trans-European networks."
"Despite the improvements that have been made to it, Mr Sterckx’s report confirms what the Council of Ministers has already accepted: subordinating safety to profit."
"I support the Savary report on creating a European Railway Agency, whose administrative board would include representatives from employees’ organisations and which would take account of the environmental, social and safety aspects in line with the proposals tabled by Mrs Ainardi."
". The rejection of my group’s proposed amendment to this common position, which has been approved in plenary by the European Parliament, is cause for regret."
"Both a majority in Parliament and the Council are seeking to liberalise this sector and broaden its scope to include national rail freight networks as well, though the Members of this House are in more of a hurry."
"Parliament is insisting that freight services (international and national) and international passenger services should have access to rail networks by 1 January 2006."
"The Council is proposing that date as the deadline for international freight services, and 1 January 2008 as the deadline for infrastructure in all the Member States to be opened up to use by all forms of rail freight services."
"It has made no provision for international passenger services."
"The Council is calling on the Commission to present, by 1 January 2007, a report on the implementation of the directive, with special reference to the functioning of the different organisations involved; developments in the market, trends in international traffic, the activities and market share of all parties concerned; the overall impact on the transport sector; the impact on safety levels in each Member State; and working conditions in this sector in each Member State, which this Parliament is unwilling to accept."
". The second railway package, like the first, aims to create a common internal market in rail transport."
"Following the examples of the telecommunications, post, electricity and natural gas sectors, it is meant to help open up the networks to competition and thus reduce prices for consumers."
"This line of thought is fundamentally sound and should be implemented, but not in the one fell swoop that some of my fellow-MEPs envisage."
"Not all railway companies are the same; that there are small ones and large ones is not attributable solely to some being more efficient than others, but also to some companies having had from the very outset a monopoly in a larger market than others."
"If the markets were opened up too quickly, the result would be unjustified and unfair distortion of competition to the advantage of the former monopolies in the larger Member States."
"Although I advocate the opening up of the railway networks, this must be done in accordance with a timetable that makes it possible for all the parties concerned, whether enterprises or workers, to prepare themselves for the new state of affairs."
"Imposing an earlier deadline for opening up the railway networks for national goods traffic – 2006 rather than 2008 – is not acceptable, any more than is the introduction of a deadline for national passenger traffic, for which 2008 has been suggested."
". I agree with the proposal of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which argues, along with the rapporteur, that the opening up of the rail market should be accelerated, proposing the beginning of 2008 as the deadline for achieving the complete liberalisation of national passenger services."
"I also support other draft amendments, which make a positive contribution to the recovery of the rail sector and establish a balanced relationship between the modes of freight and passenger transport, following the principles defined in the White Paper on European transport policy."
"I hope, then, that this will be yet another step towards the goal of a true internal market for railways, which will, what is more, effectively reduce road traffic density on our highways, in particular the huge volume of goods transported in heavy lorries."
". When considering the rail package which was voted on today, and which I totally support, the geography of the European Union must always be borne in mind."
"The peripheral territories of current Member States and new ‘enlargement’ countries must not be forgotten."
"Portugal must not be left out of the system of trans-European rail transport networks."
"The Portuguese Government is indecisive, admittedly, but the Union must not be so permissive, and must focus its attention on keeping to a timetable for overall infrastructures in the Union."
". The aim of this directive is to introduce common safety targets (CSTs) and common safety methods (CSMs)."
"According to the Council, these should ensure that a high level of safety is maintained and can be improved, when reasonably practicable and taking into account the competitiveness of the rail transport mode."
"This requirement for competitiveness, in conjunction with the requirement for the internal market to function correctly, underpins the whole content of this Directive."
"We voted against a good number of the amendments, therefore, since the objective of safer railways will not be achieved via the European Parliament’s proposals, since the latter only stipulate minimum standards at European level, preventing Member States from drawing up different national standards without the agreement of the others."
"Furthermore, the new rules must not jeopardise the free circulation of trains."
"Yet again, the European Parliament has adopted an uncompromising stance, which we oppose."
". I believe that measures must be introduced to harmonise the safety regulations pertaining in the different Member States, in order to enhance the safety of the Community rail system and, indirectly, to improve international rail service provision."
"That is why I voted for this report."
"For some time, I have argued that there is an urgent need to prioritise rail transport at the expense of road transport in all its forms, most of all long-distance transport of heavy loads of freight."
"The good safety record of European rail transport provides continual confirmation, at first hand, that this argument is valid."
"Such a policy will bring automatic relief to our overloaded highways and byways, which are plagued by accidents."
"Liberalising rail services will make a significant contribution to this process, although supervising and controlling the enforcement of safety rules, and especially the maintenance of infrastructure, should become the prerogative of the public authorities."
"As I had occasion to say at the vote at first reading, I also support the introduction of a safety certificate for undertakings in this sector and for infrastructure managers, proper training for all staff, full access to safety information for all rail undertakings and the establishment of a single common working language for international rail transport."
". The complete finalisation of this proposal for a directive by the European Commission, with a view to accelerating the implementation of interoperability between different participants in the European rail system, is also directly linked to the creation of the European Railway Agency, dealt with in the Savary report."
"This fact is yet another good reason to increase the already impressive array of good arguments in favour of establishing the aforementioned European Agency, and it will lead to the attainment of a high level of technical harmonisation."
"With the valuable help of that agency, it will be possible to ensure better coordination between investments in cross-border projects by different Member States, monitor the implementation of technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs), drawn up by the European Association for Railway Interoperability (AEIF), and fund the implementation of those TSIs."
"It is a good indication of the general consensus reached on this issue that very few amendments – only six, and insubstantial ones at that – were tabled to the Council’s common position by the specialised parliamentary committee."
"Hence my vote in favour."
"I welcome the Council’s acceptance of the European Parliament’s proposal that workers’ and users’ organisations participate in the work of the agency, especially on its Administrative Board, but these bodies must be allowed to nominate their own representatives, rather than have them appointed by the Commission."
"Naturally, Parliament wants representatives of the workers’ organisations to participate in the working parties which will later draw up recommendations, and not just, as the Council suggests, in the subsequent consultation process."
"Contrary to the proposal of the Commission and Parliament, the Council wants the agency’s Administrative Board to contain one representative from each Member State."
"Parliament supports the proposal of only six Council representatives, a position we oppose."
"As for the six representatives of railway undertakings, infrastructure managers, the railway industry, unions representing employees, rail freight users and rail passengers, the Council supports the Commission’s proposal that they be nominated by the Commission."
". The benefits of establishing a European Railway Agency to cooperate with the European Commission on achieving better coordination between the different actors involved in the rail system, and on setting up a permanent committee to stimulate debate by means of recommendations and opinions, are clearly illustrated by the results of the vote which took place in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism: forty-four votes in favour and only two abstentions."
"Establishing this agency is justified still more convincingly by the growing liberalisation of the sector and the coming propagation of uniform safety rules throughout all the Member States."
"If disseminated properly, moreover, the agency’s activities in the fields of consultancy, proposals and observation may lead to a greater awareness of the enormous benefits of rail transport among both the Member States and the citizens of Europe."
"I agree with the Committee on Transport’s view that actors in the road transport sector should be involved in the work of the agency."
"I disagree with this committee, however, over the composition of the agency."
"The committee opposes the inclusion, on the agency’s Administrative Board, of Council representatives drawn from the whole range of the Member States."
"Such representation is likely to be important, and should, at least, involve all countries that have large rail networks and/or are part of the trans-European networks."
"The tasks described in Mr Savary’s report and partly, too, in Mr Sterckx’ report are urgent."
"It may nonetheless be questioned whether a new agency is needed when, instead, the tasks could be carried out by the Commission and through exchanges and consultation at meetings between representatives of the railways sector in the Member States."
"In that way, one less agency would be needed and less tax revenue spent."
"If the railway issues were handled within the Commission, consideration of these matters could be phased out when it was no longer relevant."
"An agency is more difficult to close down, partly because of its symbolic value for the host country."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats emphasise the need for coordination and cooperation within the European railways sector, but still question the need for a permanent agency to deal with the sector."
". I am worried by the appearance of this profitable but repulsive phenomenon, which threatens the physical integrity of individuals."
"It has become a privileged area of activity of organised networks that exploit the discrepancies and loopholes in the legal systems of the Member States, at the expense of the most vulnerable groups, such as children the number of abductions taking place in Brazil and Guatemala is shocking and those living in extreme poverty."
"Action at European level has become even more urgent in view of enlargement, which will be upon us in 2004, since there is a potential risk of profitable trade routes opening up, particularly to and from Hungary and the Czech Republic."
"What is needed is an integrated Community approach, harmonised definitions of the offences linked to the traffic in human organs and tissues, and the sanctions applicable."
"It is important that an element of extraterritoriality should be introduced, to prevent individuals from seeking to purchase organs illegally from outside the Union’s territory."
"We must address the underlying causes of this criminality: the severe shortage of organs available for transplant, which is due in no small part to a lack of public information."
"Various surveys show that a large majority of citizens say they would be willing to donate their organs after death, but only a small minority formally express their consent."
"We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted in favour of the Evans report because it confirms the tragic situation which prevails today in the trafficking in organs and promotes measures to strengthen organ donation, which is the only hope of salvation for thousands of patients who lose the battle waiting for a transplant to be found."
"However, we want to point out that the lack of funding for information campaigns designed to overcome reticence, aversion and preconceived notions is resulting in a limited number of donors and strengthening the existence of the repulsive and particularly lucrative phenomenon of trafficking in human organs."
"We are faced with the worst exploitation and criminality: the abduction and murder of people, mainly young people and children, for the purpose of removing and selling organs."
"The absolute impoverishment which people know forces them to sell their organs to shrewd intermediaries."
"The disgraceful but particularly profitable 'transplant tourism' which is developing illustrates the intensity and the extent of the problem and provides clear proof of the link between this huge crime and the legal activities of big business, of the exploitation of the less developed countries and their peoples in particular."
"However, when health becomes an object of trade and exploitation, when large private clinics reap huge profits from groups of patients who need a transplant, there can be no terms or conditions to the safeguarding of transparency in organ donation."
". At the crux of the proposal under debate is the idea that the human body should not be a source of profit."
"For that reason, I voted in favour of this Greek initiative."
"I have always opposed any act whatsoever which threatens the integrity of the person, but especially when the case in point is one of easy gain at the expense of vulnerable third parties."
"I also welcome this initiative because I have to admit that it is easy for traffickers to operate in EU countries, due to the free circulation in place within the Community area."
"The rules must be very clear, and all these illegal activities must be penalised and punished."
"The trade in human organs and tissues is legitimate, however, when it is destined for medical purposes, within a very tight and strictly regulated framework."
"I support the rapporteur’s draft amendment to the title of the framework decision, therefore, altering it to read ‘illegal trafficking in human organs, parts of organs and tissues’, because I believe that that legitimate and strictly regulated trade (in commodities such as sperm, or blood and its derivatives) is advantageous and legal."
"I also believe in the benefits of the call for the Commission to create databases."
"One of these will be of legally available organs, and medical staff across the EU will have access to it."
"The other European-wide database will be of patients in need of a transplant ..."
". The traffic in human organs has increased enormously in recent years."
"Trafficking in human beings is organised in order to remove organs from living donors."
"Patients from the European Union buy organs from third-country donors, thereby profiting from their helplessness in the face of extreme poverty."
"Against this background, we must welcome the proposal for a framework decision."
"The donation of organs by living persons is a genuine source of abuse and often represents the exploitation of poverty."
"The use of living donors must only ever be considered as a last resort, when transplants from dead people are impossible."
"I therefore tabled an amendment to the effect that any removal of organs from persons that are not closely related, as defined by the law, should be punished."
"When there is no such relationship, these donations could take place only under conditions laid down by the law and once an appropriate independent body has given its authorisation."
"Organ donation by living donors must be extremely closely supervised and monitored in order to protect the vulnerable and to prevent the exploitation of human beings in order to obtain their organs, which is an unacceptable practice."
"Once again the summit has burdened the peoples with the weight of an aggravated anti-grass roots policy."
"Having attempted to overcome their opposition of secondary importance to the 'Euro-constitution', they turned their attention to the economy and the further development of repression and foreign relations and they did not fail to congratulate the Pope on his 25 years in service to God."
"As the leaders of the ΕU declared, economic recovery depends on speeding up structural reforms and increasing the flexibility of the labour market, in other words on even harsher conditions of employment for the workers."
"They also talk of 'modernising' the social protection systems and repeat that the pension systems are threatened by demographic developments, in other words by the increase in average life span."
"In order to invigorate the monopolies further, they have announced major new projects in transport and telecommunications networks."
"Again democratic rights are in their line of fire."
"On the pretext of controlling borders and immigration, they are introducing 'biometric' elements into visas and passports."
"They are calling for close police and judicial cooperation on the pretext of terrorism."
"They welcome the US-inspired decision by the UN Security Council on Iraq and have declared that they are ready to contribute to the 'stability' of that country."
"The resolution urges the current Intergovernmental Conference to adopt ‘improved provisions’ for Title IV of the Convention’s draft Constitution which, for example, deals with the procedure in the event of changes to a future adopted Constitution."
"We wish to emphasise that such ‘improvement’ must not lead to a disappearance of the demand for ratification by all the Member States in the event of changes."
"We also wish to emphasise that we are able to support the establishment of a border administration authority but that we do not wish to see any operational structure or any other form of operative cooperation."
"The European Council of 16-17 October erased from its conclusions the idea of an immigration policy based upon quotas, as proposed by the Italian Presidency."
"We sincerely regret this, for such a policy would have represented the first step towards controlling immigration, inasmuch as being able to count and monitor is a necessary precondition of implementing quotas."
"Among the opponents, Jacques Chirac, on behalf of France, stated that, at the risk of appearing hesitant about the very idea of limiting immigration, he was, , hostile to the very principle of quotas."
"Other opponents had better reasons."
"The Commission showed, in fact, that it intended to use the initiative to construct an integrated European policy of quotas, removing the Member States’ competence to determine the number of immigrant workers they are in a position to welcome."
"Moreover, it wanted to offer additional quotas to third countries that agreed to take back emigrants of theirs that had come to Europe illegally."
"That would have been a strange trade-off, rewarding those who would have harmed us when they have a strict duty to take back their illegal emigrants."
"In these conditions, it is not surprising that a number of Member States have preferred to scupper the quota policy."
"The Brussels European Council promised to be a lacklustre affair, with few hopes pinned on it."
"The statements made to us by the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission confirmed the across-the-board mediocrity of a Council unequal to what was at stake, particularly in the social and employment spheres."
"Regarding the IGC and the draft Constitution, it has unfortunately been confirmed that the debates, and, therefore, the possible last minute compromises, relate, and will relate, solely to the weighting of the votes in the Council and to the number of European Commissioners."
"We are very far from the genuine social issues and issues of citizenship that would necessitate a new constitutional framework, different from the liberal framework characterising the draft presented by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing."
"Even when modified at the margins, I do not warm to the draft as it stands."
". The recent Brussels summit concentrated on economic issues."
"These discussions focused on the workings of the EU economy and how best to stimulate growth by increasing investment and undertaking structural reforms."
"If we take the right decisions now, we can ensure that the European Union economy grows and prospers in the future."
"We know that the European economy has been sluggish recently."
"We need to be in a position to implement the full policy agenda as set out by the Lisbon process."
"To remain competitive, we must ensure that the benefits of new technologies are spread to all European regions."
"I welcome the commitment of EU leaders to continue with a multilateral approach to trading issues."
"It is important that the EU embark on the pension reform process so as to be able to cater for pension payments in the future."
"I welcome the appointment of Jean Claude Trichet and wish him well in his onerous duties as head of the ECB."
"In the international arena, EU leaders rightly focused on issues such as Iraq and the future role of the UN."
"It is also clear that negotiations on the provisions of the new EU treaty are being somewhat fast-tracked."
"Liberals, conservatives and European social democrats have tabled an unacceptable joint resolution to us on the outcome of the Brussels European Council."
"We are unable to share their political autism, faced with the feebleness of President Berlusconi’s conclusions."
"We cannot sanction the IGC’s approach to the draft Constitution, displaying contempt for Europe’s 450 million people."
"This mugging of democracy has to stop."
"A European referendum is needed urgently and, if the people opt for it, another constituent process."
"We cannot deny the way in which the economic and social situation of workers has deteriorated."
"Ten per cent of them, that is to say 15 million people, have no jobs."
"There needs to be a European law prohibiting stock-exchange redundancies."
"We do not agree to Europe’s subcontracting the crackdown on illegal immigration to third countries."
"We want to see respect for human rights, beginning with the rights to asylum, freedom of movement and freedom of establishment."
"Finally, we condemn the attitude of the European Union at the WTO negotiations, displaying contempt for the South, small-scale farmers and the world’s wage earners."
"We call for a break to be made with the anti-democratic, liberal and militaristic logic of European integration through our going to discuss this necessary and different Europe at November’s European Social Forum in Paris."
"– Mr President, I regret having to address something that is an internal group matter, but, on Tuesday, our group agreed with the rapporteur that this item 8 would be amended, as it is drafted in a misleading way."
"The fact that this was not done obliged a number of Members, including Mrs Pack and myself, to vote against this report on the grounds that its infelicitous drafting gave the impression that the Western Balkans, Belarus, the Ukraine and Moldavia were among the neighbouring regions of Europe rather than of the European Union."
"There is no doubt, though, that these states form part of Europe, and, self-evidently, the Western Balkans also have the prospect of accession – indeed, ever since Thessaloniki, the right of accession, too – as soon as these states fulfil the European Union’s criteria."
"I therefore object to the way in which this form of words puts the Western Balkans on the same level as West Africa and the Southern Caucasus."
"That is quite nonsensical."
"I do assume, however, that the expression ‘Western Balkans’ does not mean Croatia, as this House, on the basis of an amendment that I jointly got introduced into another report by Mr Brok, decided as long ago as 9 April this year that it regards Croatia as a candidate for accession in 2007."
"The report is good in many respects."
"For example, it is important to point out that a security strategy for the EU is being prepared within the framework of the UN system."
"The importance of international law is emphasised in quite a few places."
"It is made clear that, in order to be able to combat the new threats and security risks faced by Europe, there must be political strategies for combating poverty and for climate protection, the protection of human rights and the promotion of democracy and the rule of law."
"At the same time, there are things in the report that we cannot accept."
"We wish to retain the principle of unanimous decision-making in foreign and security policy, and we flatly reject a common defence of the territory of Europe."
"Moreover, we do not want to see an increase in military resources or the Community’s being given its own defence budget."
"We are not, therefore, able to vote in favour of the report."
"I voted against the Brok report, aimed at transforming the CFSP into a unified supranational policy with scant regard for what is really happening in the Member States."
"As I was saying in my previous speech when my microphone was cut off by the President of the sitting, because I had exceeded my speaking time by ten seconds, when Mr Brok was able to exceed his time by as much as he liked, the ‘European Foreign Minister’, who, according to the draft Convention, would implement this policy, would, moreover, combine the competences of the Commission, the High Representative and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers."
"He would therefore combine very different responsibilities, leading to a formidable mix of styles."
"In his introductory speech to the IGC on 4 October 2003, the President of the European Parliament, who manifestly feared encroachment by the new President of the European Council, called for ‘confusion over the respective roles’ of the Commission and the Council to be avoided."
"The fact that the Vice-President of the Commission, responsible for external relations, chairs the Council of Foreign Ministers does not, however, apparently raise objections on anyone’s part."
"We request that the Foreign ‘Minister’ should not chair the corresponding Council and that, on the contrary, he should have clearly demarcated responsibilities."
"This report is supposed to justify putting in place a common foreign policy and military force in Europe, the claim being that this will guarantee European security."
"The only recent wars in which one or more European countries have been involved – those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Côte-d’Ivoire – have all been bandit wars against countries that it would be ridiculous to claim threatened European security."
"Whether the European powers conducted them together or separately, these wars were not at all intended to defend the EU’s population but to protect the interests of its propertied classes."
"Moreover, the report may decline the word ‘multilateralism’ in every European language, but it remains no less the case that these are the mutterings of small imperialist powers to whom the main power, the United States, leaves no other choice but to fall into line behind Washington or take refuge in impotent sulking."
"The near break-up of the European Union in connection with the war in Iraq is no accident."
"It shows to what point the European Union is a motley collection of states with conflicting interests in a great many areas."
"We reject the ‘basic choices’ described by this report and to be implemented not in the interests of the people but in opposition to those interests."
". This report is the result of a broad consensus between the political forces of the right and the social democrats on developing the common foreign and security policy and militarising the European Union."
"Among the many points justifying our outright rejection of this report, I would like to highlight the following. They come as no surprise:"
"- the report ‘welcomes’ the ‘European security strategy’ presented at the Thessaloniki European Council."
"This strategy overtly sanctions the doctrine of military intervention, in accordance, furthermore, with the new strategic role of NATO;"
"- the report talks of militarising the EU in the interests of so-called ‘transatlantic relations’, seeking a ‘partnership’ between the EU and the USA so as to dominate and divide up the world;"
"- it ‘welcomes the fact that strengthening military capabilities’ has been enshrined as an objective of the so-called ‘European Constitution’, and that a European armaments agency has been set up as a central plank in the process of militarising the EU."
"It also attempts to restrict the sovereignty of each Member State in the field of foreign policy, referring to every Member State’s supposed ‘Constitutional commitment’ to refrain from adopting a national position before the EU has had the opportunity to establish a European position."
"For the rest, this report imitates the USA’s positions on most of the issues which currently dominate the world stage."
". As I explained in yesterday's debate, British Labour Euro MPs want to see a strong common foreign and security policy."
"This need is highlighted by the success of this week's common mission to Iran, and is underlined by the desperate need for Europe to maintain pressure through the quartet dealing with the Middle East Peace Process."
"However, we must caution against further changes to the proposed EU constitution; changes which in our view will not realistically help to achieve our aims."
"European Governments will not accept the community method or qualified majority voting for CFSP, nor a Foreign Minister based wholly within the Commission."
"Introducing an EU defence solidarity clause or establishing separate planning and management headquarters risks unnecessary duplication with NATO."
"Governments of militarily neutral EU countries will reject such demands, above and beyond others."
"We strongly support a defence agency, but its focus should be on building military capability across the Member States, not on the procurement of equipment for a separate EU defence force, which has not even been proposed."
"The issue overall is one of political will, not simply institutional arrangements, and that's where this Parliament – and this report – can make its biggest impact."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against the Brok report on the main aspects and basic choices of CFSP, because it supports all the imperialist interventionist/aggressive choices of the European Union for independent action or complementary action in close collaboration with NATO and the USA in the name of the European Parliament."
"It welcomes the proposal by the 'Convention' to include these choices in the 'European Constitution'."
"It supports the well-known dangerous militaristic memorandum from Mr Solana, who appeared at the summit in Halkidiki in June, adopting the three strategic objectives proposed, such as preventive strikes ('using conflict prevention to react to any anticipated crisis before it erupts')."
"It promotes as a priority the ambition to accept joint responsibility with the USA 'for peace, stability, democracy, tolerance and sustainable development in the world'."
"However, knowing the world-domination theories of the US, it is clear that the aim of the ΕU is not all this, but to share out the booty and subjugate the peoples."
"The complaints formulated by Parliament about its being sidelined are merely the fig leaf to conceal the militaristic orientation of the report."
"Consequently, the immediate and dynamic mobilisation of the peoples against these choices is needed in order to block the invaders' path."
"The report that has been presented concerning a common European security policy is supposed to advocate a transparent policy, based upon multilateralism and a global approach to security that is not purely military."
"In practice, it states, however, that this policy of the European Union ‘will depend ultimately on … its military capabilities, and on a readiness … to deploy them’."
"In addition, it considers a strengthening of the relations between the EU and NATO to be ‘an important feature leading to the development of a European approach to security’."
"Finally, it ‘[w]elcomes the measures taken by the EU in the international fight against terrorism’."
"The proposed multilateralism remains, therefore, a facade."
"The old imperialist vision of a civilising mission on the part of Europe, shared with the United States and including military options, has just been readjusted."
"Our own vision is the opposite."
"War must definitely be rejected as a means of resolving conflicts."
"Priority must be given to the social, rather than military, budgets."
"Moreover, we refuse to accept that, in the name of a highly selective fight against terrorism, which leaves state terrorism to one side, every freedom should be attacked."
"It is therefore up to our peoples to impose a different collective security policy in which the exploited of both north and south stand shoulder to shoulder in combating war and poverty."
"We have voted against this report."
". The rapporteur, Mr Brok, levels the accusation that the Council’s report on foreign policy in 2002 is just a book-keeping exercise listing action, without opinions on objectives, priorities or the meeting of costs."
"In his report, he takes the opportunity to himself express what the Council omits to say."
"When talking about influence over neighbouring regions, he makes no distinction between possible future EU Member States in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union on the one hand, and desired spheres of influence in West Africa and the Middle East on the other."
"The EU’s capacity for action would be benefited by the abolition of the principle of unanimity of the Member States and by increased power for the future European Foreign Minister."
"A powerful, united European superstate is a major contributor to the United Nations, which must be radically reformed, partly for the sake of European interests."
"From 2004, a European intervention force should have a 5000-man force permanently available for rescue and humanitarian operations, which, by 2009, should be ready to fight in wars elsewhere in Europe according to the Kosovo model."
"A united front with the USA is desirable."
"I thank Mr Brok for his clarity."
"Since his model differs substantially from my beliefs, I shall be voting against this report, although I do agree with him on one point."
"Omission to combat the human rights violations in Chechnya on the part of the EU will result in the formation of a new seed-bed for widespread terrorism."
"The monotony of these annual reports is equalled only by their limitless optimism."
"At a time when, in relation to the conflict in Iraq, Europe has shown itself incapable of choosing between, on the one hand, the uncompromising submission to the imperatives of US foreign policy desired by the representatives of the ‘young Europe’ and, on the other hand, the policy of independence initiated by the representatives of the ‘old Europe’, how, indeed, can we accept the invitation of this report and dare to produce an assessment of the CFSP in 2002 that is positive overall?"
"Let me be perfectly clear: even if I consider that it is sometimes applied in a questionable way, I do not by any means condemn US foreign policy, or at least the basics of it."
"What I deplore, on the other hand, is the blindness of the European federalists who, rather than draw lessons from the crisis, stubbornly persist in going down a blind alley by hoping to seize upon the Iraqi precedent as an ‘opportunity and a challenge finally to establish Europe as a foreign-policy performer of substance’."
"Such failure to understand the workings of high politics and such a denial of geopolitical realities are signs of new and serious disillusion to come."
"As with most reports considering the gamut of views on a given issue – EU foreign policy, in this case – we have found that some of the conclusions reached here deserve our support, while we cannot agree with others."
"That, of course, is in the nature of compromise texts."
"We agree with conclusions such as those on transatlantic cooperation, which appear in several paragraphs, or those on the need for clear definitions of priorities and threats, with a view to averting possible crises."
"As for our disagreements, I would highlight the foreign policy instruments proposed for the Union, including the European Foreign Minister, enhanced cooperation in defence policy and qualified majority voting in common foreign and security policy."
"I maintain a reserved and cautious stance on these issues, not least because they are under discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Since I wish neither to distance myself from the positions with which I agree nor to support those I oppose, abstention was my only option."
". Some of the rapporteur’s important proposals regarding the future common foreign and security policy (CFSP) deserve my unwavering support, in particular the substantial strengthening of transatlantic relations and the need for ever-greater participation by the European Union as a whole on the world stage."
"I also agree with the statement that there is a need for common definitions by European Union Member States of certain questions relating to security and defence, such as threats, interests and strategic objectives."
"I would distance myself, however, from the spectre of a CFSP seeking to operate under a qualified majority system, under a Super-Minister for Foreign Affairs, under a Directory, even if that spectre is masked by enhanced cooperation."
"I disagree with a system under which national sovereignty is disregarded and Member States’ right to independence and self-determination called into question."
"These and other proposals, remember, are among the range of basic options currently under discussion in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"For these reasons, I abstained."
"Among the now adopted items I have voted against are the following:"
"Paragraph 20 calls ‘at least in relation to decisions on proposals by the European Foreign Minister, for majority voting’."
"Paragraph 26 states ‘that the joint costs of ESDP operations, including those of a military nature, must be financed through the Community budget’."
"Paragraph 28 calls for a European defence budget and paragraph 46 for a ‘homeland defence’ for Europe."
"Swedish Christian Democrats wish to strengthen EU foreign policy cooperation, without its leading to each Member State relinquishing its own right of military decision-making or being forced to cofinance military activity it cannot support."
"The right of veto must remain for defence cooperation, together with the principle that EU military cooperation should not be developed alongside the North Atlantic Pact but within the fold of NATO cooperation."
". I welcome the initiative of tabling a motion for a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, currently sitting in New York, requesting that a universal moratorium on the death penalty be adopted."
"This initiative will contribute to the future abolition of the death penalty in every country in the world."
"Thousands of men and women share this aspiration, while the number of countries that have abolished the death penalty from their legal systems is rising all the time."
"The abolition of the death penalty is an important step forward for civilisation, one that must be extended to every country."
"Just as crucial is doing away with the policy of double standards so often pursued by the US Administration."
"The Menéndez del Valle report on the paths to peace in the Middle East rightly supports the Road Map of April 2003, which should lead to the existence of two neighbouring states, Israel and Palestine – democratic, sovereign, viable and living in peace within safe and recognised borders."
"It even adds good proposals, such as the proposal to declare Jerusalem part of the ‘cultural and religious heritage of mankind’, the dual capital of Israel and of the future Palestinian state, with an international statute respecting all the religions (paragraph 53)."
"To my great regret, I had, however, to abstain from voting on this report, for, once more, it tends to put everything on the same level: the Palestinian terrorist attacks and the Israeli military responses."
"It even congratulates the Palestinian Authority for having stuck to the ‘Road Map’, even though Yasser Arafat is supporting the terrorist organisations behind the scenes."
"Finally, this report condemns the ‘Security Wall’ built by Israel when, in point of fact, this wall should constitute a necessary separation in the process of the Palestinian state’s emergence."
"Certainly, there is room for discussing the route to be taken by the wall, but that is a detail to be negotiated should the need arise, and not a questioning of the principle."
"A future of ‘peace and dignity’ in the Middle East requires the two peoples, Israeli and Palestinian, to be able to coexist, enjoying the same rights, in particular that of possessing an independent state each."
"It is that possibility that has been closed off for decades by the State of Israel, which conducts a policy of oppression towards the Palestinian people."
"In the course of the last few years, this policy has taken the form of state terrorism, as despicable as the individual terrorism it has engendered on the Palestinian side, but using very different methods."
"Halting Israeli state terrorism in order to stop individual terrorism and abandoning the policy of creating settlements are the prerequisites of any peace process which, as well as conferring democratic rights, will have to guarantee the working classes the opportunity of escaping from poverty."
"Not only the United States, but also Europe have means of putting pressure on the Israeli leaders who have a vital need for economic, political and military support from the major powers."
"If they wished to do so, the latter could oblige Israel to abandon its policy of oppression and despoilment."
"We have voted in favour of the amendments concerning the Geneva Agreement, not specifically because of their contents but out of solidarity with those – Israelis and Palestinians together – who are fighting to bring about an end to a situation that is disastrous for both peoples."
". The problems of the Middle East are never far from our political sight, and nor should they be."
"The bottom line is simply this."
"We have a roadmap for peace in the Middle East and we must all work together to implement it in its entirety."
"That is not going to be easy by any means, in particular when one considers the levels of violence that we have all witnessed in the Middle East in recent times."
"The Israeli Government has failed to meet its obligations to dismantle settlement outposts and freeze settlement activity."
"The Palestinians have been unable to fulfil many of their commitments on the crucial issue of security."
"I have spoken before of the need for imaginative gestures from both sides in this conflict."
"The European Union does have an important political role to play in re-starting the peace process in the Middle East; it could certainly be seen to play a role as an honest broker in the region."
"I would continue to urge the Italian Presidency of the Council to use every diplomatic means available to get the Middle East peace process back on track."
". The European Parliament’s motion for a resolution attempts to find an even balance between the suggestions and criticisms aimed at the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"This objective, however, is not wholly realised."
"Indeed, some of the main criticisms aimed at the state of Israel are out of place in the economy of the text, since the actions which gave rise to them are not mentioned and the corresponding interventions are ‘justified’."
"I might mention, by way of an example, the condemnation of Israel following its attack on terrorist bases in Syria, with no direct reference made to the terrorist act which preceded it."
"The criticism of Israel’s construction of a dividing wall is also poorly supported in historical terms."
"The Israeli authorities consider that wall to be nothing more than a ‘security fence’."
"For all these reasons, I did not vote with the majority of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, opting instead to abstain."
". President, this is a serious and balanced report which is a credit to our rapporteur, Mr. Menéndez del Valle."
"As the European Parliament must always do, it rejects violence on all sides, as the only way of supporting the Road Map for peace in the Middle East."
"British Labour Euro MPs give our wholehearted support to this process, and to Parliament's vote today."
"We abstained on two technical points only."
"Yes, we believe both sides must honour the association agreements with ourselves in the European Union, but we do not believe the threat of quick suspension of those agreements is a constructive step at this stage."
"Equally, although we do not rule out a United Nations peacekeeping force at some future point, we believe it is unrealistic to call for one at this point, which would clearly not obtain agreement within the region itself."
"This does not detract from an important piece of political work, and the European Parliament can be proud of the contribution we are making today to support peace, justice and security for Israel and the Palestine."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will not be voting for the report because it maintains that the 'Road Map' is the ultimate and only solution for de-escalation in the Middle East."
"However, Israel, emboldened by the undivided support of the USA and the collusion of the ΕU, is violating every agreement, is stepping up the criminal policy of genocide against the Palestinian people, is continuing to colonise Palestinian territories and erect the Fascist-inspired wall to divide Palestine and turn it into a ghetto."
"If the erection of this wall is ultimately completed, it will annex 58% of the land on the West Bank, trapping 600 000 Palestinians and the most fertile land."
"In other words, it will objectively destroy every possibility of founding an independent Palestinian state."
"This ambition on the part of Israel is absolutely in keeping with plans of US imperialism in the Middle East, of which Israel is the long arm."
"On the pretext of the anti-terrorism campaign, the EU is also signing up to support for Israel, despite any intra-imperialist antagonisms."
"The report being debated, despite any good proposals by the rapporteur, who is trying to appear 'objective', basically sits squarely on the fence."
"In an endeavour to appease the invader, it objectively emboldens it."
"We absolutely stand by the Palestinian people fighting for an independent state and, at the same time, by the forces of Israel opposing Sharon's criminal policy, understanding that, without a Palestinian state, there can be no Israeli state."
". Ten years ago, the whole world expected that it would be possible to solve the conflict between Israel and Palestine peacefully in the short term."
"Instead of disputing each other’s right to exist and forcing neighbouring peoples to emigrate, they would live peacefully side by side from then on, without humiliation, obstacles or fear."
"Then, however, the extremes on both sides saw another chance to sow the seeds of hatred."
"Fear of the other’s violence is leading people to choose the path of violence."
"The majority of the inhabitants of Israel does accept a Palestinian State, but, back home, gives the power of government to an opponent of that State, because it sees in him its best chance of protection against Palestinian violence."
"In Palestine, groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad have grown powerful because people think that, in any case, agreement can never be reached with the occupying power, which is seizing ever more land for settlements and the construction of a wall."
"It seems that relations between Israel and Palestine will be forever hopeless as a result."
"On 12 November, the moderate powers from both countries are due to come together in Geneva to present a negotiated final solution for a just peace."
"Fortunately, this report moves in that very direction, but it is important that a comfortable majority in the European Parliament emphatically supports the peace plan today by adopting Amendment No 11."
". For some time now, this Parliament has been exercised by the desire to speed the end of the Middle East conflict."
"It might be said that this House is unanimous in its desire for a ‘firm and final peace agreement’ ensuring that Jews, Moslems and Christians can live together."
"It is unfortunate that the constructive dialogue motivated by this common goal has given way to a sectarianism more commonly found elsewhere."
"The result has been a string of monologues, one after another, that contribute little to solving this problem effectively."
"It is important to remain strictly impartial and objective on this issue, resisting the temptation to approach it bombastically."
"It gives me cause for deep regret that this issue should still be a hostage to factionalism and radical pamphleteering which, on top of everything else, damages the credibility of the European Parliament and leads to its resolutions being held in contempt."
"Comparing the actions of a democratic sovereign state in defence of its citizens to terrorism constitutes an inexcusable inversion of the principles which should guide an independent evaluation of the causes and effects of this conflict, in the certainty that peace for both nations will have to be attained not by seeking to apportion blame but via the road of justice, stability and honour."
"Through the votes on individual paragraphs, I was able to help improve the overall balance of the text."
"I abstained from voting in the final vote."
"We European Christian Democrats in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted against the proposal (now adopted by 191 votes in favour, 179 votes against and 39 abstentions) in paragraph 66, concerning ‘an international mandate in Palestine, including an international force on the ground’."
"This would have undone progress over quite a few decades."
"Paragraph 18 is unclear inasmuch as acts of terrorism committed by Palestinian suicide bombers are not kept separate from actions on the part of the Israeli army."
"Recital G describes the Middle East Quartet’s peace plan as ‘an unparalleled opportunity for the West to restore its credibility in the eyes of Arab and Islamic public opinion’."
"That is to miss the point."
"The peace plan has no aim other than to bring about peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians."
"Entrepreneurship is being promoted as the new ideal of the EU, which will resolve the problems of economic stagnation, unemployment and so on. Thus, an effort is being made, among other things, to shift the responsibility for growth from the social to the personal level."
"Unemployment, for example, is being interpreted as a lack of entrepreneurship on the part of the unemployed rather than as a constituent element of capitalism."
"Both the Commission text and the report by parliamentary Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are hymns to this new ideal."
"The Commission proposes three pillars for action: bringing down the barriers to business development, balancing risks and rewards and promoting a society that values entrepreneurship."
"In other words, it is proposing full unaccountability for companies, cheap money and guarantees that investments will bring in excessive profits and a propaganda campaign at all levels (education, mass media and so on) in order to persuade even the inexperienced that they must worship entrepreneurship or, at the very least, entrepreneurs."
"The report follows in the same direction."
"Of course we are not surprised that the capitalist EU deifies entrepreneurship."
"However, our ideals and our principles do not allow us to accept such an approach."
"We distinguish between personal action and collective action and between the profit-making capitalist enterprise and one that operates for the benefit of society as a whole."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the reports."
"It is understandable why Parliament and the Commission should look into the problems encountered by small enterprises in Europe, particularly the craft trades."
"The documents with which we are here concerned take us, however, into a virtual world or ideological construction glorifying the market."
"In this way, the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship and this report, which comments upon it, presuppose that ‘entrepreneurs are the driving force of the social market economy’."
"Wage earners, obviously viewed as the force of inertia, will be most appreciative."
"Moreover, the Green Paper conceals nothing of the Commission’s ill opinion of the ‘bottlenecks affecting the flexibility of [the] labour market’."
"The Langen report also asks for initiatives to be taken to ‘put an end to old-fashioned attitudes which insist on attributing guilt to entrepreneurial activity and demonising business profit’."
"Yet, in ‘real life’, it is in fact large companies’ attempts to maximise their profits that crush small subcontractors."
"Such companies require the lowest prices and the highest rates of work from them, with repercussions for salaries and the conditions of work of wage earners now without secure employment."
"The documents proposed have nothing to say about this, but repeat the tired refrain about the need to reduce social charges."
"We have therefore voted against this biased report of limited scope."
". I congratulate Mr Langen on the European Parliament’s excellent own-initiative report on entrepreneurship, innovation and SMEs, which I support, especially as regards the need to encourage entrepreneurship in the European Union."
"I would also like to emphasise the fact that structural change in the economy, based on knowledge-based activities in the services sector, will create new business opportunities."
"The Union and the Member States, therefore, must redouble their efforts to encourage entrepreneurship and initiative in that sector, paying particular attention to encouraging potential entrepreneurs in disadvantaged areas, especially ultraperipheral areas."
"Even though I do not agree with everything in the Commission’s Green Paper or in the parliamentary report – I particularly regret that more attention was not given to the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises – I am very pleased that the EU is resolutely engaged with the problems surrounding the entrepreneurial spirit, and I hope that the Member States will follow this example."
"At a time when Europe is on the brink of recession, everyone needs fully to understand that the route to recovery for our over-administered economies is inevitably via the promotion of free enterprise and private initiative."
"In this perspective, it really is necessary to change the attitudes both of our citizens, who too often have a negative image of enterprise creation, and above all of the authorities who, for ideological reasons, balk at creating the conditions for a genuine ‘entrepreneurial revolution’ by refusing to reduce the administrative burden and tax pressure upon companies."
"It is a matter of urgency to return to those who desire them the means and the freedom to create wealth, together with a taste for doing so."
". This Green Paper is an important contribution by the European Commission to the promotion of growth, employment and entrepreneurship."
"Indeed, the European Union can truly become ‘the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world’ only if economic actors within it, and SMEs in particular, become dynamic themselves, take an interest and participate."
"To that end, it is important to remove the obstacles lurking in every sector of enterprise policy, create a genuinely favourable environment in areas such as taxation, the workplace and ethics, and mount an energetic, swift and effective attack on problems of a structural nature, such as the aversion to risk and pessimism about setting up in business of young people in some Member States."
"I agree entirely with the rapporteur that simply devising new promotional campaigns is not enough to solve this kind of problem."
"What is needed here is a return to a belief in the forces of the social market economy in order to create incentives for potential entrepreneurs to assume entrepreneurial risk and responsibility."
"Entrepreneurship, which, it is hoped, will be a source of jobs, growth, competitiveness, the realisation of individual potential and the development of society as a whole, will stem above all from the ‘favourable environment’ which Community and national institutions are able to create through their actions."
"I feel that that is clear in …"
"We Swedish Social Democrats agree with large parts of the report but wish to point out our attitude towards a common tax policy."
"We support the idea of minimum levels for certain taxes, for example corporate income tax and tax on capital, because it would facilitate the implementation of a policy on the internal market."
"By means of a partly common tax policy, we could, for example, make environmentally damaging activities more expensive."
"We wish, however, to emphasise that we are opposed to the harmonisation of income tax."
"In the future too, it should be the national parliaments that legislate on income taxes."
"The Commission’s proposal came at the right time: on the eve of enlargement, people are worried about the possible consequences of a 25-nation Europe for their lives, starting with their employment."
"While European policies more often than not sing the praises of SMEs and of flexibility at the same time as sometimes adopting measures such as the software patent that make the lives of SMEs impossible, I welcome an initiative that acknowledges the continued status of our industries as major economic and social players."
"I also welcome the work of the rapporteur who, in choosing to place her document in the context both of the three pillars of sustainable development and of the conclusions of the Lisbon and Gothenburg European Summits, emphasises the importance of an industrial policy that is social and environmental."
"The Right has attempted to remove these emphases, fortunately without success."
"The profound changes that are to come in the industrial fabric are so many opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of certain activities."
"Unfortunately, the document continued to contain a paragraph – which the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted against, because it viewed fuel cells and hydrogen as alternative energy sources – which called both for investment in nanotechnologies, with no legal framework and no idea of the health and environmental consequences (one has only to think of the consequences of GMOs) and for investment in the security and defence industry."
"Apart from this paragraph, the Greens will support this report."
"In Europe, tens of millions of workers are wholly or partially unemployed."
"According to the rapporteur, however, everything is, apparently, more or less for the best, given that it stimulates ‘competitiveness’."
"The East European ‘social dumping’ to which she refers means in reality a collapse in the living standards of workers and, concomitant with this, mass marketing over here and the excess profits of the Western companies present in Eastern Europe."
"That is because large Western capitalist groups have bought up the companies of Central Europe."
"Others have ‘delocalised’ their production to Central Europe, and they sometimes subsequently transfer it to still poorer countries, sowing devastation behind them."
"Would the textile industry disappear from Western Europe?"
"The French clothing industry has lost 134 000 jobs since 1986."
"Its shareholders have lost nothing, however."
"According to the industry bosses, this ‘modernisation of the production apparatus’, a total of 65% fewer employees, has not affected their turnover."
"A ban on redundancies, backed by the threat of requisitioning companies that make profits, would be the only industrial policy to protect workers."
"Many companies that lay off workers in order to operate elsewhere still make profits."
"Their accumulated profits should be used to maintain salaries even if it means dividing the work between everyone."
". Having always been a campaigner for an industrial Europe and, therefore, for a European industrial policy, I have supported Mrs Zrihen’s excellent work and followed it with interest."
"I should, of course, have preferred us to have gone much further regarding the measures to be implemented (including in the constitutional framework), as well as where the environmental issues, not forgetting the social and human dimensions, were concerned."
"The political and economic power relations in Europe and in Parliament have, of course, limited our achievements."
"For all that, the pace is to Mrs Zrihen’s credit, and, because it is a move in the right direction, I have supported her report."
"This report has at least one positive aspect inasmuch as it suggests that there still exists a European industrial policy."
"It has to be noted that there are many people, beginning with the employees of European companies hit by the economic crisis, who doubt Europe’s willingness to preserve its industrial fabric."
"Certainly, European industry does in fact need to focus on its assets, including a highly qualified labour force, large capacity in terms of technology and research and a mastery of ‘clean’ production processes."
"Is it, however, enough to say that?"
"So far, there has been no end of analyses, but nothing practical has emerged."
"What is more serious is the fact that, encased as it is in the straitjacket of a Stability Pact that, in calculating the public debt, draws no distinction between productive investment and non-productive expenditure, and subject as it is, when it comes to state aid think of the Alstom affair and to concentrations between companies, to control by the Commission that is as rigorous as it is abstract, our companies manifestly do not have the means to compete effectively with US industry which, for its part, benefits from permanent government support."
"More than reports, European industries and entrepreneurs need clear political will."
"This report does not respond to this urgent need."
". I voted in favour of this important report."
"In the wake of the communication by the European Commission, it has put on today’s agenda and, once again, on the European agenda, the decisive question of future industrial policy in Europe, particularly in the context of the current enlargement process."
"The changes are currently being rung on the Union’s industrial policy, which is confronted at present with the consequences of the introduction of the euro and of enlargement."
"A new approach must indeed be found to industrial policy, hinging on the following priorities: sustaining efforts in the field of education, training and skills, reducing tax obstacles, increasing investment in research and innovation, assuring the quality of infrastructure (transport, communications and energy), facilitating the financing of businesses and social dialogue, making the procedures for starting up businesses more flexible, and so on."
"Lastly, it is indeed crucial to enhance, encourage and assist the entrepreneurial side of industry, always seeking economic effectiveness at the same time as social and human effectiveness."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has drawn up a balanced report, and I therefore voted in favour of it."
"The report is a step towards achieving the highly placed objective in the Lisbon strategy of making the EU the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy, with sustainable economic growth and more and better job opportunities."
"In a situation in which many of the EU’s Member States are wrestling with major economic concerns, especially Germany and France which are not complying with the requirements of the Euro Stability Pact, this objective feels like a distant one."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that a start has been made on debating the place of industrial issues in relation to this objective."
"In spite of everything, industry is the backbone of the European economy."
"The report also demands that the national tax systems be harmonised because, as it states, they ‘adversely affect the single market’."
"We Swedish Christian Democrats object to this wording because decisions about tax policy are a national matter."
"This led to my voting against paragraph 1d."
"At a time when the leaders of the ΕU, at the recent summit in Brussels, are expressing their support for the 'democratically elected government of Bolivia' and are calling on the people to refrain from acts of violence, Sanchez de Lozada has submitted his resignation as president of the country and gone to Miami to seek refuge with his friends."
"The popular uprising in Bolivia, which claimed dozens of victims as a result of the violent bloody repression, was an outburst by the repressed: the workers, the farmers and the natives."
"It was a claim on their part for a place under the sun, their decision to defend the natural wealth of their country from plundering by foreign monopolies and the neo-colonialism of the USA."
"Once again the people are distinguishing themselves as the protagonist of history."
"Once again it is being proven that the adversary, however strong he may appear, is not invincible."
"Although the EP resolution contains a number of correct appraisals, it takes a rather neutral position towards the popular uprising."
"That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote."
"At the same time, we express our solidarity with the people of Bolivia and the whole of Latin America and our steadfast conviction that the recent victory will not be the last."
"The resolution claims to support the democratic regime in Bolivia when, in its own preamble, it states that, in this country – the poorest in South America – small-scale farmers, workers and the unemployed are largely excluded from political life and that, moreover, this ostensible democratic regime has just massacred the poor who were demonstrating against the then President of the Republic."
"For us, the only democracy that has existed for some days in Bolivia is the direct democracy exercised by the people, a democracy that has shown that, in spite of the army and in spite of repression, the people are able to get rid of a President of the Republic not wanted by the majority."
"Bolivia is an example, not because of its regime but because of the reaction of its people."
"I roundly condemn the wave of brutal repression unleashed by the Bolivian army on the orders of the country’s former president, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, which has left dozens dead and hundreds injured."
"The struggle of the Bolivian people has evolved over the last few months, growing into a popular uprising whose central demand is a guarantee that Bolivia and its people will retain sovereignty over the country’s energy resources."
"That struggle brought about the resignation of President Sánchez de Lozada."
"It is crucial that the perspectives and opportunities opened up by this important victory for the Bolivian people should enable their most profound and legitimate aspirations to be realised."
"Particularly important is that the country should have full control over its natural resources, especially energy resources."
"This should be achieved principally through nationalisation of those resources and an end to foreign interference, above all by the United States."
"It is also essential to move towards an end to the neoliberal capitalist policies which have caused the poverty and difficulties suffered by a huge majority of the population."
"They must be replaced by policies which do the reverse, responding effectively to the needs of the workers and people of Bolivia and improving their living conditions."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."

"The next item is the report (A5-0331/2003) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication ‘Towards uniform and effective implementation of the common fisheries policy’ [COM(2003) 130 – 2003/2104(INI)]."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Fisheries have studied and debated the Commission’s proposals for an action plan to be implemented from 2003 to 2005, aimed at ensuring that access to and exploitation of fish stocks are monitored at all stages of the fisheries chain on the basis of a regime combining clear rules with a single monitoring procedure, which should apply both at the catch stage and to the transport and marketing of fisheries products."
"Such a regime should yield results which are properly comparable, whatever the operator’s nationality and whichever national inspection service is responsible."
"There is a general consensus in the European Parliament and the fisheries sector on the need to improve coordination of inspection and surveillance activities at Community level, rationalising resources and setting priorities, especially in areas where greater cooperation between Member States is necessary, namely in international areas governed by regional organisations to which the EU is a contracting party."
"Pressing ahead with those measures aimed at harmonising processes and objectives is also seen as desirable, based on the experience acquired over the years by the various Member States, notably in crossborder cooperation, always bearing in mind the role of national authorities in the monitoring and evaluation of inspection and surveillance activities in dialogue with the sector and the national authorities, while not losing sight of objective regional differences or undermining the specific role of individual Member States."
"As we emphasise several times in the report, effective implementation of the common fisheries policy depends, first and foremost, on fishermen’s acceptance of and compliance with the rules governing fisheries, which will increase if fishermen’s organisations are enabled to participate in the decision-making process at all levels."
"We believe this to be a particularly important point."
"It is just as important, however, to take measures to achieve a more effective use of national inspection and surveillance resources in selected fisheries or population units."
"These measures need to be examined and debated by all the interested parties, including fishermen’s organisations, producers, vessel owners and national authorities."
"We would draw attention, however, to the high costs of using new technology, which is important in this area and in improving inspection and vigilance measures."
"As such use of new technology may require very substantial investment, however, sufficient funding must be provided in the Community budget, and support must be given to Member States needing it."
"As for the Commission’s intention of tabling a proposal to create a Joint Inspection Structure, based principally on a Community Fisheries Control Agency, with a view to ensuring coordination of national inspection and surveillance resources, we insist that the Commission must, in coordination with the Member States, undertake a feasibility study, on as broad a basis as possible, with regard to establishing an organisational structure for Community inspection and surveillance."
"This study should, above all, include a comparative cost-benefit analysis and consideration of better use of national means and the practical implications in terms of material, financial and human resources."
"We also call on the Commission to explore models for cooperation at Community level in the field of monitoring and implementation that could offer an alternative to the proposal to create the aforementioned joint agency or structure, and which might well cost less."
"We insist on the need for such a study, therefore, before any subsequent decisions are taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by thanking all those who worked together to produce this report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, and the few honourable Members who are present, I am going to be very brief and I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo, on her report."
"The uniform application of the CFP in all the Member States is an important challenge, undoubtedly, and we must therefore also congratulate the European Commission on its proposal."
"There can be no sound fisheries policy without real and effective control in which the fisheries sector itself also participates."
"New technologies allow for better and greater control, and they must be used to improve compliance with the common fisheries policy."
"This control must not relate exclusively to fishing itself, but it must also, and this is very important, be extended to the other phases of the process, in other words, to the chain of marketing, transport, sales and so forth, also including controls in catering establishments."
"We therefore all agree that more homogeneity, more rationality, more resources and more budget are required."
"I will dedicate the rest of the time available to me to a few brief comments on the report by Mrs McKenna since, although our group had requested a joint debate on these reports, this has not been the case."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and I am pleased that, both in the annual report by the Commission and in the report by Parliament, it is stressed that just four Member States have complied 100% with the requirements for the corresponding boxes in all segments of the fleet."
"These States are: Finland, Denmark, Spain and Portugal."
"In other words, there are 11 States which are not complying with them, and that is the most important thing in my view, together with the clear fact – and allow me to point this out as a Spanish person – that Spain is one of them. In this way I hope to counter, and I would like to make this clear, certain attempts to slander and discredit the Spanish fisheries sector."
"Spain, however, is one of only four States, I repeat, which comply with the fleet-reduction plans, and I believe it is necessary to stress this here, in the presence of other States and therefore of other representatives of other Member States which are non-compliant."
"– Mr President, the communication we are debating in favour of a uniform and effective application of the common fisheries policy is thought-provoking and leads us to consider issues which go beyond the CFP itself."
"The objective pursued – the coherent application of the common fisheries policy – should be extended to all Community policies and, furthermore, to European Union policies and Member States’ policies."
"We call for coherence, not contradiction, between the various Community policies and also between the various aspects of the CFP."
"We must direct all actions of the common fisheries policy towards a common objective, that of sustainable fishing, which is the only way to make fishing a lasting activity."
"But the Union’s other policies, such as industrial policy or environmental policy, must also contribute to the preservation of resources."
"The Community institutions have become, as a result of the principle of subsidiarity, a form of legislative machinery which depends for its execution on the Member States, which means that this uniform and effective implementation depends on the goodwill of those States."
"By the same token, infringements and compliance or non-compliance also depend on them."
"Violations of Community legislation are increasing, and this is undermining it and making it less and less effective."
"At the same time, calls for the renationalisation or regionalisation of Community policies such as the CFP are also increasing."
"Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that the draft European Constitution lays down four exclusive competences for the Union and that one of them is precisely the management of fisheries sources."
"The parliamentary Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore pleased that the Commission is proposing the creation of a common inspection structure."
"We have called for this common structure in numerous resolutions, such as the one adopted in relation to the Green Paper on the reform of the CFP. The Commission, therefore, has the support of Parliament."
"In Spain, the Count of Romanones, who was a minister during the era of the Restoration, at the beginning of the twentieth century, said: ‘laws are for Parliament, but leave the regulations to me’."
"Well, the objective of sustainable fishing will not be achieved on the basis of laws or on the basis of regulations, which are necessary but insufficient."
"It is essential to involve, on the one hand, the Member States and, on the other, all the agents who participate in the sector, in the broadest sense, including marketing, so that we can achieve this objective."
"Moreover, action cannot be restricted to the Community framework – as we see in every meeting of the Committee on Fisheries – since the causes of many of the problems facing our fishing arise at international level, and it is at that level that solutions can be found."
"Cooperation between the various administrations is therefore essential if we want the CFP to be successful."
"Furthermore, the regional and local administrations, which often, as in the case of marketing, are responsible for applying Community rules, must also feel that they are participating in decision-making."
"– Mr President, we have in front of us a good report, and I should also like to underline that."
"It is extremely important that we have uniform rules and uniform monitoring procedures."
"That is very important if we are to have fair competition in Europe."
"I also think that it is important that the monitoring be organised at international level as far as possible, so that north, south, east and west all have the same feeling about the completion of the monitoring."
"I should like to emphasise that there are a great many plans, that we all want structural change, but I should like to add that the financing of this must be temporary."
"We must not give a permanent allowance for the implementation of these structural changes."
"I should also like to say another thing about the practical implementation in the future."
"I think that changes are necessary, and they can only be achieved if the fishermen’s organisations are willing to cooperate."
"There are sufficient individual examples of this in the European Union, but there is too little structure."
"I should also like to make another plea for something that the North Sea Commission Fisheries Partnership has already introduced, namely letting biologists sail on fishing vessels."
"This means that they no longer miss the boat, since they are following in their own little boat."
"We must ensure that ecology and economy want to share the same future; changes can also be made much more effectively if that desire is there."
"I should like to draw attention to this system, therefore, and also make a renewed call for new, improved methods: that is to say, research into acoustic methods for distinguishing species of fish, and a review of the situation regarding by-catches – as it is incredibly important that we form a picture of not only the main catch, but also the by-catch."
"It is important, therefore, that we are also able to record that picture by landing the catch and, at landing, recording everything that comes out."
"This is how to make a real contribution to the future of the fisheries."
"In addition, by way of conclusion, I should like to make one more small remark: it would also be useful if the rights were transferable in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fisheries are a sensitive area, like conflicts of any kind: it is an area that is fortified by its traditions, but where freebooters and pirates of all kinds disturb the peace."
"We therefore congratulate the rapporteur on the clarity and courage of her report."
"Secret and illegal activities, poaching and clandestine trade jeopardise the entire activity of professional fishermen."
"This activity will only be politically and socially objective and economically profitable if the controls are effective, fair, clear, transparent and identical in all of the EU Member States."
"However, today they are notoriously inadequate."
"To strengthen them, they must be streamlined and modernised."
"We need to develop controls on satellite positioning and improve logbooks, and each state must establish substantial and adequate human and material resources."
"States are responsible for controls, as you pointed out; they must continue to be responsible for them, but they must improve and strengthen them."
"The European Union must coordinate them and the Commission’s specialised fisheries departments must assess the impact of this improvement."
"If the impact of these controls continues to be insufficient, and only if this is the case, perhaps we will have to consider the possibility of a joint inspection structure, which would be supported in particular by a Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"– Mr President, I can say that my group and I hold Mrs Figueiredo’s report in very high regard."
"Our common fisheries policy is only as strong as its weakest link."
"This means that monitoring is particularly important, because it is only by means of effective quota management that we shall be able to conduct a successful common fisheries policy in the future, too."
"For that reason, I have tabled a number of amendments, also on behalf of my group, which the Committee on Fisheries and the rapporteur have taken over; for this I thank them."
"Differences in the Member States’ monitoring methods must be eliminated."
"For that reason, we strongly advocate a Community office to monitor the enforcement of the CFP."
"That policy would also benefit from being firmly rooted in society and from confidence on the part of the sector itself."
"Consequently, we have campaigned for the possibility of setting up transnational producer organisations."
"Enabling cross-border coordination gives a system of sustainable fishing a broader basis."
"The efforts of fishermen are indispensable in this regard."
"On that point, I should also like to call once more for particular attention to the shrimp sector."
"For years, this sector had a system of sustainable fishing, which earned the praise of many."
"However, a national competition authorityin the Netherlands intervened, and this was brought to an abrupt end."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to make an emphatic plea, including to the Commission, that Commissioner Fischler make a commitment to permitting these producer organisations."
"This is incorporated into an amendment which I have tabled, and the Committee on Fisheries has approved."
"Too much and too often, the efforts of other Commissioners seem to frustrate Commissioner Fischler in that regard."
"I am referring in particular to Commissioners Monti and Bolkestein, whose portfolios include competition policy."
"An excessively liberal approach on the part of one section of the Commission must not frustrate the social position of fishermen and the environmental situation in the North Sea."
"In that sense, too, I am very happy with this report."
"The Commission would do well to realise that the efforts of fisheries’ producer organisations, in particular – including across borders – will be indispensable to a genuinely rigorous approach to the fisheries issue in the future."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Figueiredo for her very good report and for her constant hard work within the committee."
"The proper control and monitoring of the common fisheries policy and the even-handed implementation of the rules is, of course, the only way to return a semblance of credit to this much discredited common policy."
"However, I have to say that any new control system will require the cooperation of the sector, of the fishermen themselves."
"The fishermen are rapidly losing any respect they ever may have had for this discredited policy."
"For example, take what happened last week."
"The same week as the ICES published its most recent report, calling for the complete closure of the cod fishery around Britain and Ireland, the Council of Ministers tore open the Irish Box and tore open the economic exclusion zone around the Azores and Madeira, allowing a virtual free-for-all in some of the most sensitive spawning and nursery grounds in European waters."
"This was a decision based on political pressure; it owed nothing to conservation and everything to politics."
"It is decisions like this that have brought the whole CFP into disrepute."
"How can our fishermen believe that their endless hardship is in the name of conservation, when they see decisions like this being taken which fly in the face of common sense?"
"It is also time that the Commission tackled the disgrace of the two million tonnes of good healthy fish that are discarded dead back into the sea every year in the name of conservation."
"The public will no longer tolerate this needless waste which has become emblematic of the failed CFP."
"I am grateful to Mrs Figueiredo for trying to breathe life back into the corpse of this discredited policy, but I fear it may be too late for resuscitation."
". Mr President, I think that the comments we have just heard confirm both the quality of Mrs Figueiredo’s work and the full agreement and convergence of the views of the Commission and Parliament on this subject."
"I have one reservation with regard to the last comments by Mr Stevenson as I do not agree with his analysis of the state of the common fisheries policy, but he will no doubt understand that the Commission’s assessment is not completely akin to his own."
"As regards the issue of shrimps, raised by Mr Maat, we will certainly take note of this issue and there is no doubt that Mr Fischler will talk to his colleagues about it and, if necessary, to Mr Monti."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place after the debate on points under Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the report (A5-0332/2003) by Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the annual report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the results of the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at the end of 2001 and on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the intermediate results of the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets at 30 June 2002 [COM(2002)446 – COM(2002)483 – 2002/2262(INI)]."
". The Commission would like to begin by thanking Mrs McKenna for her report and for the work that has been carried out on this topic."
"In general, Mrs McKenna, we agree with your analysis of the guidance programmes for fleet capacity, known as MAGPs in our jargon, and MAGP IV in this case."
"You also know that we applied the lessons from this to the reform of the common fisheries policy in order to make up for the shortcomings you highlight, which had become evident to all."
"We agree, too, with your recommendation that the export of fishing vessels to third countries should no longer be financed: as you are aware, we suggested this in our reform proposal."
"The Council postponed the application of this a little further than we would have liked, but the main thing is that from 2004 exports of fishing vessels with public aid will no longer be authorised."
