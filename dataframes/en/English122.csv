"I want to use my remaining time - since this is as you say our last legislative day before the election - first of all to thank you, Mr Onesta, for your forbearance and your good humour throughout this session and to extend my thanks to the staff, to the ushers and to the interpreters."
"If this prolongation of the session beyond midnight has indeed led to this extraordinary extra cost, first of all I hope that some of it has gone into their overtime."
"They display a professionalism from which a lot of Members of this Parliament could learn."
"Secondly, I would ask the Presidency to look again at the Rules."
"The reason we are here is because the vote was not followed, as is explicitly provided for in Rule 163, by explanations of vote."
"This says that once the debate has concluded, every Member shall have the right to make an explanation of vote in not more than 60 seconds."
"It really alarms me that we have arbitrarily set aside what our Rules of Procedure plainly state."
"If we want to change that rule, then that is fine."
"There is a mechanism for doing that."
"However, as long as that is what the rule says, it is incumbent on us to obey it in letter and spirit."
"Forgive me for contradicting you, Mr Hannan, but the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the issue a very long time ago: 'once the debate is finished' does not mean 'immediately after the end of the debate'."
"We are currently at the 'once the debate is finished' stage, but I am sure you will come back to me in order to have that amended - I have faith in you."
"(PL) Mr President, the ritual slaughter of animals, which causes them extreme suffering, is inconsistent with our civilisation."
"I do not believe that any religion which aims to do good could require something like this from its followers."
"Such slaughter is, rather, a custom of savage and primitive tribes, and we should not agree to it."
"If religious toleration is to be used as an argument, then we should add that there are religions in the world which practice the ritual killing of people."
"Are we also going to agree to that?"
"Is that our community of values?"
"Rejection of Amendment 28 would have given at least the possibility for maintaining or introducing a ban on such practices in particular Member States."
"Adoption of Amendment 28 reveals the true, bloodthirsty face of this Parliament."
"I voted in favour of the report as a whole, but I did so only because other provisions improve the situation of animals designated for slaughter."
"Mr President, the time of killing is one of the most important but potentially one of the most sensitive issues we can legislate for in this House."
"But we cannot just walk on by, because many of my constituents in the West Midlands are concerned that the legislation will affect their religious rights."
"The decision about whether or not an animal should be stunned before slaughter is not something that should be decided here but at Member State level, through open dialogue and consultation with religious communities."
"We need to walk, not run."
"This seems to me the best approach on this issue."
"The role of this House is not to impose norms and values but to represent and reflect the views of its constituents and get a balance."
"We can work it out together."
"While most MEPs would prefer it if all animals were stunned before slaughter, we should uphold the right of religious communities to eat meat killed in accordance with their religious beliefs."
"Finally, Mr President, can I thank you for all those who are here tonight, because I think only the lonely are here tonight, and we are all hopelessly devoted to you because that is why we are here tonight."
"(ET) European social models face many problems at the moment, for instance demographic changes and globalisation, which also influence the models under discussion."
"For that reason, European social models must be modernised in view of long-term developments, while at the same time preserving their initial values."
"In the context of the present economic crisis, it is extremely important that social policy go hand in hand with economic policy."
"For these methods to be effective, they must be democratically structured, i.e. on the principle of working from the grassroots upwards, and they must be implemented at the local level, i.e. closer to the citizens."
"The proposal was in the spirit of these principles, and for that reason I support the report prepared under the guidance of Mr Silva Peneda."
"Mrs Oviir, you are not bothering me in the slightest, moreover I am pleased to tell you that you are the last speaker, on the last report."
"(ET) Sometimes it is good to be first, and sometimes it is good to be last."
"I would like to mention the following things: in the present severe economic crisis, the European Union's labour market is controlled by the reality that more and more people are being made redundant, which in turn will increase the total number of individuals suffering from poverty and alienation in Europe."
"Today it is very important that social involvement and the connected labour market policy also be pursued through an integrated and united approach in the recovery plan for the European economy."
"We have spoken extensively about flexibility in labour market policy."
"It is high time we also spoke of flexibility in social policy."
"By that I mean that labour policy and the policy for granting social assistance should be connected."
"The present situation requires this."
"The report supported the active involvement of unemployed people, and I considered it to be very positive to vote in favour of passing this report."
"Mrs Oviir, your fan club has stayed to the end."
"The next sitting will start shortly, because it is already Thursday 7 May 2009, the last day of the sixth legislative term of the European Parliament."

"MEDIA Mundus: audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an audiovisual cooperation programme with professionals from third countries MEDIA Mundus - C6-0011/2009 -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me particular pleasure that we have succeeded in drawing up and adopting a new support programme for European films for the culture and economy of the European Union and worldwide within a short space of time - just six months - and before the end of this legislative period."
"This was only possible because there has been exceptionally good cooperation, for which I would like to express my warmest thanks."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The Commission's proposal on the establishment of the MEDIA Mundus programme was an excellent one."
"There was excellent cooperation with the Czech Presidency and cooperation in the Committee on Culture and Education was best of all."
"Only as a result of this was it possible to achieve this goal in such a short time."
"The promotion of European films through the MEDIA programme has been very successful in the European Union for some 15 years."
"Ninety per cent of all European films shown outside their country of origin are promoted by the MEDIA programme."
"So far, however, the programme has only promoted projects within Europe, and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies."
"There are new opportunities, but also new challenges."
"The MEDIA Mundus programme we are discussing today is a fantastic response."
"It is a response to the opportunities offered to the European film industry by new markets outside Europe."
"It is also a response to the need and the opportunities to use the promotion of films and films themselves to support and drive forward intercultural dialogue."
"That is why I should like to express my thanks that the pilot MEDIA Mundus projects were launched."
"EUR 7 million were made available."
"It became clear that there was huge demand."
"Training, marketing and distribution in global networks were supported by the pilot projects and, in particular, the emerging audiovisual markets of the world - India, Brazil, South Korea, Canada - have submitted outstanding projects."
"In this regard, with the vote of the Committee on Culture and Education we gladly vote in favour of the proposal."
"I should like to ask the entire Parliament for a 'yes' vote to support this programme for the coming years with an appropriate amount of funding to achieve the objective of supporting the promotion of European films as global ambassadors for our cultural values."
"This is my last speech in the European Parliament."
"I feel very lucky to have been able to complete the programme with your support and should like to pass on my own message."
"Where future work is concerned, please remember that cultural goods in Europe should not be simply economic goods but must remain both cultural and economic goods."
"I should especially like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Culture and Education, in the secretariats, and you, Commissioner, and your Director General at the helm, Gregory Paulger, for ten years of excellent cooperation in the audiovisual field. Many thanks."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I could not agree more with what Ms Hieronymi has said, and those 10 years of working together with her and with other Members of the Committee on Culture and Education were very efficient and, from a personal point of view, very enriching."
"So, thanks to you all, from whatever parties, who have really been working for culture to become important and culture to be able to speak to the people."
"I am very glad that Parliament made some proposals on the report, which are clarifications and simplifications, so they improved the proposal which I had put on the table."
"As you know, the preparatory action MEDIA International has been the basis in order to develop MEDIA Mundus and, in this context, I am also grateful to Parliament for giving me EUR 2 million in 2008 and EUR 5 million in 2009 to finance preparatory action."
"MEDIA Mundus will start in 2011 and will follow on from MEDIA International."
"It aims at strengthening cultural and commercial relations between European film industry professionals and those from all over the world."
"The concept of MEDIA Mundus is new, ambitious and innovative, because it promotes cooperation between professionals, which is not done normally by European programmes, and, unlike existing programmes, it is also based on mutual benefit, not only for our film-makers but also for film-makers from third countries, in different fields."
"The first one is training, including trainees and trainers from European and third countries."
"It will improve access to third-country markets and build trust and long-term commercial relationships: this is normal."
"When you have been sitting together at school, training for the film industry, with somebody from Asia, somebody from Africa or from the Americas, it is clear that, later on in your professional life, you have an impetus to work together."
"That is also why we support the organisation of forums for international co-productions."
"We train them together, and then we expect those professionals start to work together."
"So we need the forums for international co-productions."
"Then we have to improve the distribution, circulation and visibility of European audiovisual arts in third countries."
"That is always a win-win situation for people from third countries within Europe."
"Here is a very good example of a Europe which is not a fortress Europe but an open Europe, a Europe which gives, which takes, which shares."
"We have to improve public demand for culturally diverse audiovisual content, which will be very important, so we have to get the youth, the young public most of all, to see European films."
"I am very confident that MEDIA Mundus will increase consumer choice, so that people will have the possibility to watch European films."
"It will bring cultural diversity to European markets by getting more quality films from smaller markets outside Europe into Europe, and it will give a chance to European films on the international market."
"So it will create new business opportunities for professionals from Europe and around the globe."
"This is, of course, a very important economic contribution."
"It is a question of competitiveness, but it is most of all a question of cultural diversity - our cultural diversity - which is our most precious good, and the cultural diversity of those who live in other continents, which is their most special good."
"To share those is a wonderful chance, which will be built up by MEDIA Mundus."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Hieronymi, the MEDIA Mundus programme is a project based on an idea originating in our Committee, the Committee on Culture and Education."
"That is where it saw the light of day, so to speak."
"Above all, we gave it our strong backing and it of course bears the hallmark not only of the commissioner but also of Mrs Hieronymi, whom all of us on the Committee on Culture and Education were glad to support."
"We have learned a great deal from the Erasmus Mundus project, which opened the door for our students wishing to go to third countries and vice versa."
"In the context of globalisation, this is actually necessary, and MEDIA Mundus goes in the same direction with regard to film-makers."
"It is a wonderful example of how one can organise an intercultural dialogue in this field, which has a commercial aspect of course, but which is also, and above all, a cultural dialogue."
"MEDIA Mundus will also support and implement the UNESCO Convention promoting cultural diversity in Europe and across the globe, establishing dialogue and striking a balance between economic and economical interests."
"With MEDIA Mundus we of course strengthen the mobility of our films, film-makers and students and, in the end, what Wim Wenders keeps reminding us to do happens, namely we give Europe a new face, we turn the European dream into reality."
"The American dream has been conveyed to us through films for decades, and this is still the case today."
"If we eventually go so far as to bring the European dream to the world in cooperation with third countries, through images, we will have done much more to stabilise the European Union than we could have done in many other ways."
"If we work together in today's globalised world, we will be able to drive the Americans back on the world market to some extent and portray our dream a little better."
"I am sure we will be supported by third countries, perhaps South Korea or countries of South America, which we in fact want to help by making their small-scale productions become more visible on the European market."
"All in all, this is a project that helps all sides."
"It helps the third countries and the European film industry."
"It was high time this happened."
"MEDIA Mundus is, in my view, the appropriate response to global technical and socio-economic challenges."
"I should like to end by saying: 'What helps our diversity will strengthen our identity'."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Hieronymi, I should like to extend my sincere congratulations on this report."
"All of us on the Committee on Culture and Education can be pleased and proud of what we have accomplished in such a short time."
"We have demonstrated that we can work flexibly and that we are not bound by procedure but pay due regard to the concerns of those who work in the film industry and who are urgently waiting for this policy to be successfully concluded."
"We have speeded up our work and we will still be able to work after the policy has been adopted and the resolution has been passed."
"We have not insisted on a reading."
"Those who constantly criticise our work and malign the positive things we have done should bear this in mind."
"I am pleased that, in the year of creativity and innovation, we are helping the creative to be more innovative and enabling them to further their training and become more globally integrated."
"In the digital world, everything changes day by day, technology is different and there are new resources and new challenges."
"It is therefore necessary to create another network."
"This needs the financial support we are giving."
"If we want to further the growth of our European film industry and promote the idea of Europe, we not only need better quality, which is already very good but could be even better, but we must also give our creative artists financial assistance."
"With the economic crisis on everyone's lips, creating new jobs in the film industry, enabling innovation, improving information sharing, research and market research is a contribution to creating jobs."
"There is huge potential here for enriching the job market."
"As far as cross-border cooperation and dissemination in third countries are concerned, I should like to give an example."
"For me, Slumdog Millionaire is an example of success."
"This film, which went around the world, was supported by the MEDIA Mundus programme to the tune of EUR 830 000 and became a global success; it made us more aware of an emergency situation in a particular country."
"However it also showed what it means when we cooperate on a cross-border basis."
"That is why I think this programme is an excellent programme and I am pleased that we completed it without any problems in such a short time."
"I should especially like to thank Mrs Hieronymi and wish her all the best."
"She has been an excellent colleague and media expert. Thank you, Mrs Hieronymi, and all the best."
"Mr President, the objective of the MEDIA 2007 programme was to preserve European identity, diversity and cultural heritage, to improve the circulation of European audiovisual works and to increase the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector."
"The MEDIA Mundus programme goes further and hopes that mutual benefits will come from the promotion and opening up of audiovisual markets in both the European Union and in third countries."
"This is, of course, a good concept."
"This subject, however, leads us to reflect on something else."
"I am thinking about Europe's cultural influence in the world - that influence seems to be getting smaller, and this worries me greatly."
"I notice, too, that our continent does not participate in intercultural dialogue as an equal partner."
"The Christian traditions which shaped Europe are generally being questioned today, and it seems that Europe does not have another conception of its own identity."
"Therefore it is no surprise that it is losing."
"Europe's small share in the worldwide circulation of audiovisual works is a significant example of this."
"We may lament the fact that, along with its diminishing economic significance, Europe's role will be still smaller."
"However, we do not have to rend our garments."
"Initiatives like the programme we are discussing are a small but necessary step."
"Furthermore, the next five years of the European Parliament lie before us, and we hope that the MEPs of the next term will make Europe's voice more audible."
"The last sitting, the last speech - I would like to express my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members for their cooperation, and in particular the members of the Committee on Culture and Education, with whom I worked on a daily basis."
"I congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on her report. Thank you, all of you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, indeed, our culture and media policy is about giving Europe a soul."
"It has been quite rightly established, by Commission President Barroso amongst others, that people will not fall in love with the internal market - as important as it is - but want to see and enjoy cultural diversity, the cultural heritage of Europe."
"They also want cultural diversity to be the ambassador of Europe in the world."
"Mrs Pack was quite right when she said, using a sentence of Wim Wenders, that we need European images to tell European stories, to express the diversity of European history and of European sensibilities."
"What was the tragedy of European history, and what are the great hopes of a peaceful and better future?"
"That is the basic cultural understanding of the European Union, which we not only want to cultivate internally but also need to convey to the outside world."
"That is why European culture policy, and film policy in particular, is always an ambassador for European identity."
"That is why I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting this programme off the ground."
"I should like to say from the outset that, in the next parliamentary term, this programme must be extended, invigorated and injected with more finances, so that the MEDIA Mundus programme can really fulfil its role of making it clear, in international cooperation, what European values are and what European cultural diversity is."
"There must also be co-productions, collaboration, training in the best sense of the word, a win-win situation which enriches both sides."
"In this age of globalisation and digitalisation it will be the trademark of European policy on culture."
"Today, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Hieronymi for her very good cooperation and for succeeding in making it clear in this House that, while culture has an economic side, it is always more than just a commodity."
"It is really about identity, diversity, cultural confrontation - in the best sense of the word."
"Because that is what moves people in their hearts and minds."
"Placing more trust in Europe than hitherto must be our obligation for the future."
"For that reason, Mrs Hieronymi, I extend my sincerest thanks for your good cooperation and wish you all the best for the future."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I thank Mrs Hieronymi for her excellent work and wish her many more years of success."
"The development of the international audiovisual environment deserves our attention because this is an interesting field of activity and it opens up a large space for cooperation within the European Union and also with other countries in the world."
"A further deepening of this cooperation, including the EUR 15 million budget for MEDIA 2011-2013, will broaden the choice for consumers and will bring more culturally diverse products into the European and international market."
"At the same time it will aid mutual understanding between peoples with different cultural traditions."
"Other very valuable aspects of these EU projects include the ongoing training courses for professionals in the audiovisual field, the varied promotional activities focusing on cinema, and the opportunities for increased circulation of films."
"It is also obvious that the audiovisual field is primarily the domain of the younger generation, who use television and devices operating via Internet protocols and multichannel digital television as one of their basic sources of information, together with other Internet technologies."
"The support of these systems through the EU project may therefore help to improve the quality of service for these users."
"In this context I would, however, like to emphasise something else which I consider to be of key importance."
"All the Internet media represent an unrestricted alternative to traditional means of communication."
"Unfortunately, even in democratic societies, these traditional means of communication often fail because of commercial interests or because their management belongs to a particular political milieu and indirectly obliges employees to practice self-censorship."
"Because of this, much information reaches its audience in distorted or selective form."
"In contrast, the huge spread of the Internet, and the films and information which it disseminates, offers a genuinely independent, pluralistic media environment free of monopolies and cartels."
"We therefore need to support all projects which strengthen this alternative to the mainstream media world, and I am glad the Czech Presidency has contributed towards the successful accomplishment of the MEDIA Mundus project."
"(SL) With the MEDIA Mundus programme, we are on the right path to promoting European film and European knowledge more effectively."
"Film is a medium which enables us to record, preserve, portray and sell Europe's cultural diversity."
"However, given the rapid pace of development of modern technologies, we also need continuous education and training."
"It would be a pity if some third countries or less-developed continents were to stop making films depicting their people's lives, interesting stories about them, and, of course, their own natural and cultural heritage and history, just because they lag behind in development and lack knowledge."
"Because of the dominance of US film, which commands a huge market, European film has a tougher job competing in the world market, despite the fact that it has far more qualities than many a US tear-jerker or blockbuster."
"This is why MEDIA Mundus is a good platform for forging contacts with film-makers and distributors in third countries and for exchanging film-related knowledge and information."
"By the same token, in this field, the European Union fulfils the function of bringing different continents together and uniting film-goers from various countries, as well."
"We will be gaining a new, successful programme, but losing our rapporteur and an expert in this field."
"I should like to pay my personal compliments to you, Mrs Hieronymi, for all the work you have done, for the breadth of your vision and for your cooperation."
"When I entered Parliament as a new member five years ago, Mrs Hieronymi was the first person I turned to for advice and information, and she was always prepared to offer help and understanding."
"So, once again, allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you and wish you happiness in your family life, and in your professional life, because I know that you will not be putting your feet up in the future."
"Some of you know that you will be coming back."
"I would like to come back, too, but I do not know whether or not that will happen."
"Allow me, therefore, to express my thanks, here and now, to all the members of the Committee, the Bureau and Parliament for giving me the opportunity to work on the Committee on Culture and Education."
"It has been enjoyable and pleasant working for you."
"Regardless of our political affiliations, we have worked to benefit culture, education, young people and sportsmen and -women."
"Furthermore, despite the fact that I come from a small country, my ideas have been taken up by the Committee and were later also confirmed by Parliament."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
"(ES) Mr President, the Universal Declaration of UNESCO on Cultural Diversity recommends that, among other things, we promote the making of high-quality audiovisual productions, particularly fostering the creation of cooperation mechanisms allowing us to distribute those productions; the European Commission has clearly borne this statement in mind when drawing up this initiative."
"It goes without saying that MEDIA Mundus will take advantage of the growing interest and opportunities created by worldwide cooperation in the audiovisual industry and will widen the range of possibilities for consumers, bringing products that are more culturally diverse to European and international markets and creating new commercial opportunities for audiovisual professionals in Europe and around the world."
"It is my conviction, and we should be in no doubt, that the Commission is capable of managing the budget so that this has the greatest impact possible and does not fade away into separate projects."
"As a prestigious professor said, the MEDIA Mundus programme for audiovisual cooperation with third countries is proof that the international audiovisual landscape has changed considerably, particularly in technological terms."
"This initiative aims to develop opportunities for cooperation in the audiovisual market, boosting research and training as well as financing coproduction projects in order to boost cooperation between audiovisual professionals."
"I also wish to finish by expressing my gratitude."
"It has been a pleasure working with all my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education for these past two years. Thank you, see you soon."
"(FR) Mr President, first of all I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi and to the Committee on Culture and Education."
"The worldwide development of the European film industry is made possible thanks to this new MEDIA Mundus programme."
"In fact, this programme is rooted in a policy."
"It was created under the MEDIA International action which, since 2007, has focused on the development of the European Union's relations with the audiovisual markets of third countries."
"The aim of this action was to meet the immediate needs of third countries and to improve the overall effectiveness of MEDIA 2007."
"It was important to address the new problems and challenges resulting from the globalisation of markets, which affects the European audiovisual sector."
"This preparatory action thus paved the way for a European Union programme of extended aid promoting global cooperation in the audiovisual industry."
"Then, very quickly, the European Commission - which I congratulate - adopted a proposal to establish the MEDIA Mundus programme."
"With a budget of EUR 15 million for the period 2011-2013, the programme will offer new possibilities for international cooperation and networking - and this concept of networking is extremely important - among audiovisual professionals from the European Union and from third countries."
"Audiovisual media are very popular among young people."
"They make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue, and the task, here too, is to establish new global balances in this sector between the United States and between other continents, which are major producers, and Europe, which has its rightful place."
"The programme is open to partnership-based projects involving a minimum of three partners, with each partnership being coordinated by a professional from the European Union."
"Developing information sharing, training and a sound knowledge of markets, improving the competitiveness and transnational distribution of audiovisual works worldwide, improving the circulation and exposure of audiovisual works worldwide, and increasing public demand for cultural diversity - all of this is covered in this programme."
"We support the European Commission's proposal, as it means that this consensual programme that we have arrived at can be implemented."
"I am full of hope for this text;"
"I endorse it because it is in keeping with my firmly held beliefs about respect, about intercultural dialogue, and about providing support for creative work, for training and for the audiovisual industry, and I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Hieronymi."
"I know that, in the next parliamentary term, we will owe it to her to continue to work along these lines."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal on the MEDIA Mundus programme is welcomed by everyone who wants to see the European audiovisual sector grow, become stronger and more competitive and export to the rest of the world."
"The European audiovisual industry has developed and improved considerably over recent years and its international profile has changed over the last 20 years, especially as a result of technological progress."
"This has resulted in intense economic development and investment and, as a result, an increased demand for audiovisual material on certain markets."
"Unfortunately, however, there are obstacles which affect the marketing of European works abroad, including inadequate funding for European audiovisual companies."
"Community support for the audiovisual sector takes account of the fact that the European Union and its Member States promote cooperation with third countries and the competent international organisations in the cultural sector, because it underlines the importance of respect for different cultural dimensions, so as to promote diversity and, finally, because the distribution sector determines the diversity of audiovisual works and consumer choices."
"There are still few European audiovisual works available on the international market, while audiovisual works from third countries, excluding US works, face similar problems of limited availability on the European markets."
"European distributors are basically small companies with limited means of obtaining access to international markets."
"Consequently, the new programme makes funds available so that measures can be taken to improve the distribution, marketing and promotion of European audiovisual works in third countries and, by extension, of third countries in Europe."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate Mrs Hieronymi on yet another exceptional piece of work and to wish her well in her personal life and in her future role, following her exceptional presence in the European Parliament."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Reding and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed during this five-year term."
"(RO) The field of culture definitely contributes to achieving economic objectives, taking into account that there are roughly 5.8 million people employed in it."
"However, it also contributes to achieving social objectives through the promotion of the European Union's values throughout the world, not to mention extending consumers' opportunities for choice, and through boosting the audiovisual industry's competitiveness in the EU."
"The programme in question is also relevant because it takes into account the impact of technological developments in the field, all the more so as an ever-increasing demand for audiovisual content has actually been generated."
"I welcome a coherent programme for promoting European audiovisual works worldwide, given the fragmentation of the market at European level, compared to the audiovisual industry in the United States, for instance."
"Last but not least, I firmly believe that better use will be made of the added value generated by the film industry in Member States."
"I can give you the example of the film industry in my country, Romania, which has proved itself up until now through the major prizes won at European and global level."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and wish her every success in her life after the European Parliament."
"(LT) Ladies and gentleman, I have been working in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for five years."
"However, based on the experience of my own country, Lithuania, I must emphasise the importance of the programmes you are debating for a country's economy, not to mention the culture of a small country."
"A few years ago our film industry was in the doldrums."
"It was cooperation with third countries which helped get it back on its feet again."
"During that period Lithuania's film industry grew stronger, established an economic base and now makes a significant contribution to job creation."
"At the same time, this has created the right environment for the emergence of talented directors and today Lithuania's film directors are receiving international awards, and are well known throughout Europe and the world."
"Therefore, I would like to stress that the European Union should pay more attention to the implementation of such programmes, as they help countries and cultures flourish."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to start by paying tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Hieronymi, who has guided the Committee on Culture and Education using all of her expertise in this specific field."
"Thank you, Mrs Hieronymi, for all that you have done."
"Commissioner, you have succeeded once again in completing this project; it is an important project, but it must be weighed against the importance given to it, and it certainly does not match your ambitions in terms of financing."
"Provision will therefore have to be made, for the next financial perspective, to increase the resources for this programme."
"These people, who travel, must be granted every available possibility and freedom, and it is in this connection that we still too often run into unresolved problems concerning visas, social security and artistic status."
"Much still remains to be done to make artists truly mobile."
"For the rest, I believe that film is the best vehicle for cultural diversity."
"We should therefore support this sector, which is still in its infancy."
"Perhaps the existing idea of a guarantee fund could be the way to shore up the finances, which fall slightly short of our ambitions."
"(PL) Mr President, films from third countries are fairly often distributed in Poland."
"They are rarely of high quality, and meanwhile it is much more difficult for our European films to reach third country markets and viewers."
"In the meantime it is extremely important to support the spread of our culture."
"It is essential to promote European films in other countries."
"It is essential to ensure a better position for these films in third-country markets."
"In addition, strengthening the film industry will also ensure that the films produced are of higher quality."
"That will also be a significant value."
"I think that an important factor here is the synergy effect achieved thanks to mobility and cooperation with third countries."
"Strengthening the protection of intellectual property is a significant matter raised by the programme, and also in connection with support for implementation of the UNESCO convention."
"I would like to say a huge thank-you to Mrs Hieronymi for her work on this programme and for the fact that she managed to finish before the end of this term of office."
"It was work that we did together, but her contribution was the greatest."
"I would like to thank very sincerely all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education with whom I worked during this term."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you to all those who have contributed to making our cultural diversity, not only in Europe, but also transcending borders."
"I would like, at the end of this speech, to give you some concrete examples of how this can work and how it has already worked."
"We have developed 11 training partnerships with Latin America, India, Canada, Turkey, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia covering films, TV shows, animation, documentaries."
"For example, a cartoon connection between the EU and Latin America and Canada for training and developing a cartoon specialist."
"For instance Prime Exchange, a workshop for authors and producers from India and Europe, to understand better the financing and the marketing elements of films."
"And the promotion on the distribution has been done, for instance, by the European Producers Club, which organised co-producing workshops in China and in India."
"Dolma organised a documentary month in Chile, the Paris Project made co-produced productions between Japan and South Korea and Europe, and EuropaCinema has included a network of 230 European cinemas and 148 cinemas in the rest of the world, in order to exchange films between them."
"So here we can see very concrete action."
"It is not about big words but about deeds, in order to help the professionals to do themselves what they can best do: that is, to make films, to show films, to make films travel."
"Thanks to all those who have helped this to become a reality."
"Mr President, I thank you for the supportive and constructive debate."
"I am certain that, with this impetus, the MEDIA Mundus programme, which has rightly been addressed today, will not only enjoy great success but will also be able to mobilise additional support in the coming years."
"Anyone who deplores the lack of or insufficient European culture in the world, which they have every reason to do, can only welcome the MEDIA Mundus programme and vote in favour of it enthusiastically."
"It is an excellent example of how we can bring our cultural message to the world."
"That is why I would earnestly request that you convey this message to our governments with vigour."
"Promoting European culture collaboratively does not mean less national identity for all our countries and Member States in the European Union."
"Rather, it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our European culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world."
"On that note, I would like to thank you all."
"I invite all of you who would like to discuss how we could go about this to the Members' bar."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Draft Commission Regulation on REACH, as regards Annex XVII (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Ouzký and Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the draft Commission Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), as regards Annex XVII - B6-0230/2009)."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is particularly important, as we know, for two reasons: firstly, because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced, namely asbestos."
"With the question we have asked and the draft resolution we will vote on today - let me say straight away to reassure the Commission and Vice-President Tajani who is here on its behalf - we are not opposing the draft implementing regulation that the Commission has adopted on this issue."
"I refer to Point 2.6 of this draft measure, which provides the missing Annex 17 that should have reproduced the provisions of Annex 1 of Directive 76 - the directive on dangerous substances, which will be replaced by REACH, and therefore repealed - this Point 2.6 extends the ban on the placing on the market of asbestos fibres and products containing asbestos."
"The truth is that in this same decision, however, there are exemptions, to be granted by certain Member States - for the record, there are four of them - who may keep articles marketed before 2005 on the market, as well as diaphragms containing chrysotile asbestos used in production at existing electrolysis plants."
"The possibility of using these exemptions is of course subject to the Member States' compliance with all the Community rules on worker protection, effectively meaning that these plants, coming to the end of their lifecycle, do not generate problems for workers' health."
"There is a reason why we are not opposed to this: these exemptions do exist, but we must acknowledge that the Commission has provided a mechanism, so to speak, by which these exemptions will in time - in 2012, to be exact - be reviewed through reports to be made by the Member States concerned, on the basis of which the European Chemicals Agency will prepare a dossier providing for the gradual withdrawal of the exemptions."
"Thus we are not opposed, but certainly with our resolution we want to give you in the Commission a strong impetus to be a bit bolder, to go a bit further and a bit faster, shall we say, above all bearing in mind that there are already alternatives to chrysotile asbestos, at least for high-voltage plants, and in fact the companies concerned have launched promising research programmes to find alternatives for low-voltage plants also."
"There are two aims to our stimulus and our input."
"The first is to set ourselves a date, a deadline - we are proposing 2015 - by which to lift these exemptions, launching a real withdrawal strategy, including measures that will then be required to demolish these plants in safety and also ensure safety as regards export."
"Lastly, the second thing we are asking the Commission - and we would appreciate a reply on this, too - concerns a point that is critical for us, namely the fact that a Community list of articles containing asbestos for which an exemption applies has not yet been adopted, and so we are of course asking for this as soon as possible, by 2012, to enable better control and a better understanding."
"Mr President, honourable Members, first of all may I apologise on behalf of my colleagues, Vice-President Verheugen and Mr Dimas, who unfortunately cannot be here this morning to take part in this debate."
"I know that Mr Verheugen has had intensive and fruitful discussions with the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, whom I should like to thank for his excellent work - I say this on a personal level, too."
"The Commission fully subscribes to the objective of the human health and environment professions, on the one hand, by preventing all exposure to asbestos, and, on the other, by working on a total ban on the use of asbestos, in all its forms."
"Within the European Union there are very strict regulations on the placing on the market, use, export and disposal of asbestos fibres."
"The placing on the market and use of all asbestos fibres have already been banned outright by Directive 1999/77/EC."
"As far as other uses are concerned, the Member States may permit the use of a form of chrysotile asbestos in electrolysis installations that were already in service in 1999 until they reach the end of their service life and suitable asbestos-free substitutes are provided."
"Four Member States use this derogation."
"A review in 2006-2007 showed that all workplace exposure limits were respected and that there was no alternative available at the time for some very specific processes."
"This existing limit will be incorporated in Annex XVII to the REACH regulation, and the derogation for diaphragms containing chrysotile will be reviewed again in 2011."
"In June 2011 the Member States will have to report on their efforts to develop chrysotile-free diaphragms, on the measures taken to protect workers, and on the sources and the quantities of chrysotile used."
"The Commission will then ask the European Chemicals Agency to examine the information sent with a view to abolishing this derogation."
"Directive 87/217/EEC on the prevention and reduction of environmental pollution by asbestos provides for measures to control asbestos emissions during certain demolition, decontamination and disposal operations in order to ensure that those activities do not cause pollution by asbestos fibres or dust."
"Directive 83/477/EEC, as amended by Directive 2003/18/EC, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, contains a series of measures to ensure adequate protection of the health of workers, where the latter are exposed to risks linked to exposure to asbestos fibres."
"Companies must provide evidence of their ability to carry out demolition or asbestos removal work."
"Prior to the demolition or asbestos removal work, they must draw up a plan specifying the measures needed to ensure that workers are not exposed to an asbestos-in-air concentration of more than 0.1 asbestos fibres per cm3 during an average eight-hour shift."
"Framework Directive 2006/12/EC on waste and Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste, in concert with the Council decision on the criteria for waste acceptable in landfills, oblige the Member States to provide for the controlled disposal of asbestos fibres and equipment containing asbestos fibres."
"The Member States must ensure that the waste is recovered or destroyed without endangering human health and without requiring the use of processes or methods that could harm the environment."
"There are detailed requirements concerning the process for the disposal and landfill of asbestos; for instance, the storage area must be re-covered each day and before each compaction operation."
"The landfill must be re-covered by a final layer in order to prevent the dispersion of fibres."
"Measures must be taken to prevent any possible use of the land after the closure of the landfill."
"Any potential exports of asbestos fibres are regulated under Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, and, since 2005, there has been only one notified case of asbestos fibres being exported from the European Union to a third country."
"Moreover, the asbestos-related decisions appearing in Annex XVII of REACH are set to ban the manufacture of asbestos fibres within the European Union, which means that exports will be ruled out."
"Waste containing asbestos is hazardous waste."
"The Basel Convention and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste prohibit the export of asbestos waste to countries not belonging to the OECD."
"As regards shipments between Member States of the European Union and of the OECD, they are subject to a prior written notification and consent procedure."
"To conclude, and in the light of these points, I can assure you that the Commission will examine whether there are grounds to propose other legislative measures on the controlled disposal of asbestos fibres and on the decontamination or disposal of equipment containing asbestos fibres, which go beyond the legislation in force, both for the management of waste and for the protection of workers."
"(IT) Mr President, honourable Members, as regards the list of articles containing asbestos, which may be authorised on the second-hand market, it is not yet available - to answer Mr Sacconi's question immediately - but the Commission does plan to review the situation in 2011 in order to draw up a harmonised list valid throughout the European Union."
"I therefore hope I have met your request."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, in 1999 the European Union adopted a directive banning asbestos from 1 January 2005, but permitting a derogation for diaphragms used for existing electrolysis cells until they reached the end of their service life."
"This derogation, which had to be re-examined before 1 January, was intended to enable the companies concerned to make plans to stop using asbestos."
"Here we are today, with an 18-month delay; it is therefore time that we made progress."
"It is true that, as part of the review of Annex XVII to REACH, the Commission is proposing to extend the current ban on the use and marketing of asbestos fibres and products containing these fibres, but it is maintaining the option for asbestos to be used in factory-based electrolysis installations, with no time limit imposed, even though asbestos-free alternatives do exist and are used by many companies."
"Moreover, the Commission is adopting a provision that permits the placing on the market of articles containing asbestos in accordance with a system that could vary from one country to another."
"This is unacceptable, since the use of this product is responsible for a large number of illnesses linked to exposure to asbestos fibres."
"Furthermore, the number of people succumbing to these illnesses is likely to continue to rise over the next few years, as this product was still being used up until a few years ago."
"The effects of asbestos on health have long been known."
"I would add that the Commission's decision undermines certain REACH provisions, not least the principle of substitution; it is a bad signal that has been sent out to the other companies."
"The current economic crisis cannot justify this extension."
"Furthermore, this position of the Commission's, which has the backing of a majority of Member States at the Council, is inconsistent with the European Union's position, which aims to introduce a worldwide ban on asbestos."
"I have one last point before I finish: the European Trade Union Confederation is today maintaining that it was not consulted on the matter and is suggesting that only the opinion of certain companies was heard and taken on board."
"The Commission, for its part, is claiming the opposite."
"Could you shed some light on this point for us?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the history of asbestos is a sad one and a cautionary tale of what can happen when the precautionary principle is ignored."
"Asbestos was first used as a material that had excellent technical properties, and then, later on, it was noticed that it killed people."
"For example, in my country, the number of deaths every year due to asbestos has still not gone down."
"After all, it can take anything up to 40 years for the disease to develop."
"The purpose of the resolution before us is not to quash the comitology decision to which it refers."
"I think its most important points are paragraphs 8 and 9, which relate to the idea that the Commission should table a legislative proposal sometime this year concerning how asbestos, asbestos fibres, and equipment and structures containing them should be completely destroyed."
"Of course, we still have a large number of buildings, including public buildings, ships, factories and power stations, that have structures containing asbestos, and, for example, people are exposed to it when buildings are being renovated, if no strict protective measures are taken."
"These structures that contain asbestos need to be identified and demolished, and asbestos must be destroyed safely and in such a way that people will not be exposed to it again."
"We should learn a lesson from the sad tale of asbestos and our experiences of it when we address new and present health risks."
"For example, researchers into nanocarbon tubes have said that their effects on health are very much the same as those of asbestos."
"For that reason, we need to learn a lesson from our experience and act in accordance with the precautionary principle, for example, when we adopt basic legislative instruments regarding nanomaterials."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, it really seems as though the thousands of deaths already caused by asbestos, and the tens of thousands of people at risk of dying in the coming years due to progressive exposure to asbestos - the latency period, we know, can be up to 15 or even 20 years - count for nothing at all."
"It seems as though the Eternit trial, which began in Turin concerning the events at Casale Monferrato, where there is not one family that has not suffered a loss, counts for nothing."
"Asbestos should have been banned operationally by the Member States applying the 1999 directive."
"The States should have taken every possible precaution to protect exposed workers, by applying the 2003 directive, closing factories, neutralising contaminated sites and compensating the victims and local people."
"This has not happened everywhere."
"Little or nothing has been done."
"I have already mentioned the trial in Turin, where Swiss and Belgian owners are accused."
"Everyone knew about it, but little was done, and above all the industry shirked its responsibilities, working within the loopholes created by the inertia of the public authorities."
"This inertia can be seen in the events in Italy, in Brioni, where asbestos has not been removed, in Porto Marghera and in Cengio, where deaths are still occurring."
"Today the industry is asking the Commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 REACH regulation, already granted for a limited period, for chrysotile asbestos fibres."
"It is true, low-voltage electrolysis plants do represent a limited application, and there are only a few such plants, but where industrialists claim it is impossible to use any alternative then the plants should be closed."
"This may be blackmail, but alternatives to this process have been found in Sweden, using asbestos-free membrane technology as replacements, at low voltage, and a similar solution has also been adopted for the production of hydrogen."
"Why 'yes' in some States and 'no' in others?"
"Because in the long battle to ban PCBs there have been countless omissions and stalling techniques, supported even by the European Commission Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry."
"In this case, too, a good example has not been set."
"The 1999 directive banning asbestos stipulated that the review of this authorisation should be preceded by an opinion from the scientific committee on toxicology, which was never produced."
"Is this how the Commission respects directives?"
"Not to mention the trade unions, who say they were never even consulted."
"The European Parliament is doing its bit to compensate for the failings of others."
"This resolution calls on the Commission to bridge, by 2009, a legislative gap on the prohibition of second-hand products containing asbestos; roof pieces, aeroplane parts and whatever else should be disposed of once and for all."
"Yet again, precise dates are being set for a strategy to ban all types of asbestos by 2015, but these objectives were already set in 1999."
"Ten years have gone by and the deaths have continued."
"Among the first initiatives of this parliamentary term, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left called for the establishment of a Community fund to compensate victims and for ad hoc funds for decontamination."
"This was a specific request to the Commission, which today is instead bowing to the will of the multinationals."
"We need to move on, however, to practical action and commitments."
"Only when these are in place, starting with the demands of this resolution, can we be more understanding."
"Today that willingness is not evident, and so we will vote against granting this exemption."
"Mr Bowis has the floor."
"We have great affection and respect for him and are pleased to see he has recovered."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, you are very kind."
"Thank you for those words."
"It is good to be back for what is my last week in this Parliament - or any parliament."
"After 25 years of elected politics that is an adequate sufficiency, I think."
"I just want, on this last occasion, to say that many of us in this House have invested a lot of ourselves in the REACH process: Guido Sacconi and many colleagues have laid the foundations for a safer, better chemicals framework."
"My message to the next Parliament is, 'Be vigilant; keep an eye on the process'."
"Similarly, as Satu Hassi has said, we have a long history on asbestos, and we have a very strong feeling that we need to watch out for that."
"When I was lying on my hospital bed, having my heart bypass and feeling sorry for myself, I was watching on the television the earthquake in Italy, and that put my problems into perspective."
"But it also, of course, reminded me in this context that, when you have a disaster like that, asbestos can be released into the atmosphere."
"Asbestos is very often safe while it is covered."
"As soon as it breaks out, that is when the dangers occur, and so one of the messages has to be that we need to look at the at-risk areas of our European Union to see where we should be highlighting the risk and monitoring it for the future."
"Having said that, I would just say thank you to my colleagues for their friendship, their support and their messages in recent weeks."
"I shall treasure my 10 years in this Parliament, and I shall watch with interest as the next Parliament takes on the projects that perhaps we have been able to start."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Bowis."
"You can rest assured that many of us will always remember you and be grateful for your effort and dedication in Parliament."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my sentiments exactly."
"I, too, would like to make a personal comment."
"First of all, however, I must acknowledge that the Commission's answer to the specific questions we are asking in our resolution has been positive, for the most part."
"It will, of course, be down to the new Parliament to check and ensure that the commitments outlined are met, and within the time periods provided."
"On a personal note, I would like to say two things."
"Firstly, my best wishes go to Mr Bowis, with whom we have worked a great deal."
"Perhaps the two of us could form a club of European Parliament observers, especially to follow those matters on which we have done so much work together, and seen great fruit, I believe."
"Secondly, I have to say, somewhat symbolically, the fact that my last speech in this House should be on REACH and its application, which has occupied my time since the beginning of this parliamentary term, when it seemed we would never come to the end of that legislative journey, well, it shows that I am a lucky man, fortunate also to have known people like yourselves and like you, Mr President; working together we have come to a real understanding and have produced what I believe are truly significant results for European citizens."
"Thank you, Mr Sacconi."
"Rest assured that we shall also miss you for your work and dedication."
"May I wish you luck and happiness in your future endeavours which, I am sure, will continue in the same style to which we have become accustomed here."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I too, before concluding this debate, would like to thank Mr Sacconi and Mr Bowis, and I do so as their old classmate, having served in this Parliament myself for so many years."
"I would like to thank them for the work they have done, and for participating in the various alliances that have done credit to our Parliament."
"So, as a member of the European Parliament and today as Commissioner and Vice-President of the Commission, I thank them for the extremely valuable contribution they have made to Parliament's work, showing that there can be - despite what certain journalists have said at times - good representatives who attend and genuinely serve the institutions, which represent half a billion Europeans."
"For that reason I wanted to thank them in this my last speech in this parliamentary term as commissioner."
"As I was saying, I wanted to thank Mr Sacconi anyway, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for having brought this key issue to the table, and Mr Bowis, whose speech and comments have shown how important this subject is to all citizens."
"I think and hope that this debate has succeeded in dispelling any doubts and concerns: the Commission will report regularly to Parliament on the application of the regulation and, let me be clear, will not compromise on protecting workers, health and the environment."
"As regards the remarks made by Mrs Ferreira and Mr Agnoletto, I would point out on behalf of the Commission that the European Trade Union Confederation was consulted, and chemical workers in particular have declared themselves in favour of keeping the exemption."
"I would also like to emphasise that it is not true that there are no time limits, since the exemption is revoked when an alternative product becomes available."
"Furthermore, let me remind you, the Commission will conduct a general review in 2011."
"Thank you again for your comments and for all the hard work you have put in on such a sensitive issue concerning the health of workers and, I would also say, the health of all EU citizens."
"To conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Further reductions in asbestos in Europe must be welcomed unreservedly."
"As the carcinogenic effects of asbestos fibres have been known for decades and the EU also introduced a ban on the use of this harmful substance in new products in 2003, the last relics of asbestos use should now slowly disappear from Europe."
"Most Member States are already choosing alternative methods."
"Especially in the area of electrolysis plants other materials can often be used as an alternative to asbestos."
"In the light of the increased awareness of the people of Europe of health issues and the very high standards of environmental and health protection in Europe, it is unacceptable that carcinogenic substances are still in circulation in Europe."
"Common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Costa, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports - C6-0097/2009 -."
"Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, I have the pleasure of opening this debate with a conclusion, so to speak, by recommending at this time that the House adopt the amendment tabled by myself and all the group representatives within the committee, to conclude this report at first reading and thus obtain approval for the regulation."
"We do so with a great sense of responsibility."
"I think Vice-President Tajani will agree that the way in which we have tried to respond to an objective need and difficulty of the airlines at the moment - allowing them to retain their time slots even if they do not use them during the summer season this year - is a necessary, but very rough measure, a measure that needs refining."
"It needs to be refined because we have seen, in the brief time that discussion has been allowed on this, that there are different interests, all of which are absolutely legitimate, among the airlines, that there are companies waiting to replace others, where the first are unable to meet their commitments, that there are now distinct interests among airlines and airports, something that did not happen only a short time ago, and above all that there are the interests of passengers, most importantly those served by airports and airlines in the outermost regions, who would be at greater risk should the choice of retaining or abolishing slots depend solely on their profitability for the companies concerned."
"These are all issues that we have been able to touch on very quickly, but which we have laid on the table."
"Essentially, we also felt we had to deal with the basic problem, that of considering slots, as we ought to, as public goods that can be allocated or granted to private operators such as airlines and airports, but cannot be transferred as property."
"This is a very sensitive topic and one that I believe we will have to revisit."
"I have to say that the reason, or worthy compromise, if you will, that lies behind our swift adoption of the proposal in the forms to be presented here is in fact in this, it is in being sure that the Commission will honour its commitment to return to this subject in a more thought-out, in-depth way, to tackle once and for all what is a crucial issue not only for overcoming the current crisis, but also for completing the process of restructuring and liberalising the global air market, and for building a better air market within Europe."
"That is why, combining current requirements with longer-term needs, I feel able to recommend that this report be adopted."
"I, too, in the 20 seconds I have left, Mr President, will take advantage of this last-day-of-school atmosphere to thank my classmates and those with whom I have had occasion to work over the last ten years, since I now have the great pleasure of ending my final day in Strasbourg with my last but by no means least contribution."
"Thank you, Mr Costa, and congratulations on your fine work."
"Your name is linked to a series of important reports and your effort has therefore played a role in Parliament's recent history."
"Mr President, honourable Members, once again, as a former Member of this House, I would like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and its chairman for their productive work when I was an MEP and for the cooperation they have shown me since I had the honour to be appointed, and endorsed by Parliament, as European Commissioner for Transport."
"This fruitful partnership, ladies and gentlemen, can be seen again today, and so I must thank Parliament once more, especially the transport committee, chaired by Mr Costa, for the speed with which they have handled the European Commission's proposal on slots."
"A series of events - the economic crisis, the financial crisis, the new type A flu virus - is further aggravating the situation in the air transport industry, and this situation demonstrates just how urgent and indispensable support measures are, not only for the airlines, but also their employees."
"In light of this, I share Mr Costa's concern."
"The Commission proposal is not a definitive solution."
"It is perhaps a proposal intended to address an emergency, but which will then need to be re-examined in detail in order to redesign the whole system; in fact on 15 April, in response to Mr Costa's concerns and comments, I informed him, as the committee chairman, that the Commission Directorate-General for Energy and Transport is already preparing to present a proposal as soon as possible to revise the regulation."
"The rule on the use of slots has already been suspended twice in the past in order to tackle crises."
"It is a global response to a global crisis, a response that clearly does not affect one or two Member States but affects the air transport system of the entire European Union and, in the most serious of circumstances - the attacks of 11 September and the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis - similar measures were taken."
"The crisis hitting the air transport industry today is probably more serious than those, and as yet we have no indication as to when we will start to see improvements."
"The reality is that traffic is in continual decline."
"Suspending the 'use it or lose it' rule for the summer season will benefit all companies, European or otherwise, without any discrimination, as the IATA and many non-European companies have pointed out, moreover."
"I am sure that this measure, which will be for a limited period and is an exception - the suspension will in fact be in force from 29 March to 26 October this year to then allow slots to be retained for the summer season of the following year - will give some breathing space to all companies, allowing them to address the drop in demand."
"It will also prevent paradoxical situations such as the current case where companies are forced to fly empty planes so as not to lose their slots, something I consider to be wholly unacceptable, not least from an environmental perspective, as well as detrimental for the airline's finances - and we know than when a business is in difficulty, so are its employees."
"I am convinced that this measure is necessary and urgent, and so I cannot fail to support the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council, which will enable the proposal to be adopted immediately."
"For this reason I would again like to thank the chairman of the transport committee, and Parliament as a whole."
"Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the one-off suspension of the 80% minimum usage rule for the take-off and landing rights at airports granted to airlines for the 2010 summer flight programme and thanks the rapporteur, Mr Costa, for his speedy and effective handling of this dossier."
"The suspension now makes it possible for airlines to scrap flights in line with falling demand beyond the planned minimum usage without losing their take-off and landing rights for the next season."
"In my opinion, this is justified as a one-off, for one period, as the Vice-President said, because there has been an unforeseeable collapse in passenger numbers due to the international financial and economic crisis and because airlines cannot yet predict how passenger numbers will develop in the future."
"The suspension also helps to protect the environment, as airlines might otherwise feel obliged to fly half-empty aircraft just to keep their slots."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, at the outset the PPE-DE Group rejected the regulation also proposed by you of empowering the Commission, without genuine codecision on the part of Parliament, to demand the suspension of the rule simply in the comitology procedure."
"We believe that, if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan, Parliament will have to examine it carefully, because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully."
"It is 'yes' to a one-off suspension but 'no' to the possibility of extension without the involvement of Parliament."
"In all honesty, I believe that, with swine flu appearing not to be as virulent as first feared, airlines will ultimately have to be able to anticipate what possible passenger numbers and relations to expect over the coming years."
"We must expect airlines to submit realistic plans so that airports have the opportunity to offer unused slots to other airlines."
"It must be in our interests that airports be able to use their capacities in the best interests of their customers, the passengers."
"I have one other comment on the new, fundamental revision of the Slots Directive."
"I believe that the slots belong to the public and not to the airports or the airlines, and that is why we must pay particular attention to this in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as this debate, this plenary session and my parliamentary activity draw to a close, allow me to extend my sincerest thanks to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism and in the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Vice-President of the Commission and his entire DG TREN team."
"We have spent the last five years working together in the interests of the citizens of the European Union."
"I will keep my fingers crossed for you that the next five years will bring more of the same."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism is an important committee, and I thank you for your excellent cooperation."
"Thank you, Mr Jarzembowski, and I wish you good fortune and happiness for the coming years and your future endeavours."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank our chair, Paolo Costa, not only for producing this report but also for his work as chair of the committee over the past parliamentary period."
"We are very indebted to his hard work."
"This report is a microcosm of Paolo Costa's work, because it is a report that clearly shows that the wisdom of Solomon, allied to the diplomatic skills of the United Nations, is often needed when dealing with such technical details like 'use it or lose it on the slot'."
"Our chair has been a very good Solomon and a very good United Nations diplomat during his time."
"But yet again the civil aviation industry has demonstrated its ability to be disunited on this important issue, with big airlines clamouring for a suspension while low-cost airlines and airports are demanding no suspension."
"What concerns me is that the big airlines, backed up by their various alliances, will not be satisfied with one suspension but will demand others and, knowing the unhealthy, undemocratic influence that some of them have both in this and national parliaments, I believe today is a mere start of a process, sadly not the end."
"My group will support the compromise proposed by our rapporteur and endorsed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but I stress that this suspension, as my colleague Georg Jarzembowski often says of the 'use it or lose it' clause, is a one-off for one period and does not represent a green light for further suspensions."
"If the Commission feels that further suspensions are needed, then they must be made part of a revised regulation, fully involving this Parliament and fully respecting the rights of this Parliament."
"It is 'yes' to debate, it is 'yes' to cooperation, but it is 'no' to comitology."
"I recognise the perilous state that the aviation industry and airlines in particular face."
"I also understand that slots are not just about take-off and landings."
"They have become capital collateral on airlines' financial books and our rapporteur is right when he states that this aspect needs to be revisited in the future."
"Suspension of 'use it or lose it' will not affect London Heathrow, Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam Schiphol, but it will affect regional airports serving those hubs, because it is those routes the airlines will suspend."
"What airlines need to remember is that there are other stakeholders, not just them, that will be affected by this suspension."
"Because the economic situation is not good and because we recognise the nonsense of flying empty aircraft, we will support our rapporteur on this occasion, but I hope our caveats to this have been duly noted for future reference, not only in this Chamber, but by the wider aviation industry as a whole."
"Finally, as the Socialist coordinator, can I thank all my team, but also my fellow coordinators from other groups for the sterling work and the cooperation that we have shared with each other during the last five years."
"I also extend those thanks to Commissioner Tajani and his team in the time that he has been in the Transport Commissioner's seat."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time I have spoken in this House."
"It is, however, the first time because I am a new Member, and I have seen things that I do not like, that is to say Mr Costa has made a decision with his committee and then we find that there are deals going on."
"They may even be above board, but these deals done outside of the committee ..."
"They say there is democracy in Europe."
"I do not think so, Mr President."
"Democracy would mean transparency, and there has been little transparency here as regards Mr Costa, as regards citizens in the air sector, as regards people, as regards airports and as regards workers."
"We are supposedly talking about liberalisation, but in fact what we are dealing with is a monopoly."
"I say this because of departures from Linate airport and Malpensa airport that are monopolised by Alitalia-Air France."
"Take Linate, which is in dire straits with 160 000 positions in difficulty."
"Should we leave Linate congested to allow for the Frosinone airport advocated by Undersecretary Letta?"
"I wonder then, are all these non-services provided because Alitalia does not have the aeroplanes to cover these services and these working hours?"
"Why, then, do we not give them to other companies that can provide a service?"
"Mr Costa rightly said, 'We are trying to do the best we can'."
"I am aware that there could well be people who do not like Mr Costa - I do - but someone must not, or they would not treat him with such disrespect."
"You see, Mr President, we are currently facing..."
"Here, Linate has 126 000 on its waiting lists, while Alitalia-Air France does not want to make these journeys."
"Airports have to survive too, however."
"They have to cut flight costs."
"Why, since we are talking about the public right to flight slots, do we not start to teach Alitalia, Air France and many other airlines to work?"
"So, in this regard, I not do not want there to be any electoral opportunism."
"You see, Mr President, these systems are known as 'lobbies' in Europe, whereas in Italy we call them 'economic entities', 'the mafia', 'camorra' and 'ndrangheta'."
"Mr President, Mr Tajani, Mr Costa, this is going to be my final contribution to a debate at the European Parliament, after a fifteen-year stint."
"For me, this is, therefore, a very special contribution and one that I am making in a special debate, a debate dealing with the six-month suspension of the regulation on what are known as 'airport slots'."
"Over the past few years, I have sought to promote a green transport policy in order to secure the future of the transport sector."
"I think that, with this report, we have succeeded in doing that."
"Lowering the 80% threshold to 75% would not solve our problems."
"Even if we lowered it, the airlines would still not consider putting a stop to the practice of flying empty planes."
"Fortunately, however, the compromise we have reached provides for solutions which are, first of all, good for the environment, but which also offer some support to the aviation sector, which has been hard-hit by the economic crisis."
"In this dossier, I think we have to conclude that there is something wrong with the current legislation relating to airport slots."
"As long as these slots remain so lucrative that it pays to fly empty planes, the present legislation is not going to make any difference."
"For this reason, I am pleased to see that the text indicates that any further suspension of the slot system will warrant a thoroughgoing change in the legislation."
"Of course, we would then need two different dossiers, so that any emergency action necessary could be taken rapidly and so that we could make sure there was enough time for a comprehensive review."
"I would be interested to hear Commissioner Tajani confirm whether this last supposition would be taken into account."
"Mr President, I would now like to round off both this speech and my work in this Parliament."
"It has always been a pleasure to work with my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to thank all my fellow Members for that and Chairman Costa, in particular, for his report, which we are currently discussing, and also for his readiness to work on a sensible compromise on airport slots."
"Thank you, Mr Blokland."
"I also wish you good fortune and happiness in your future endeavours outside of Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to me it seems entirely appropriate that the exemption from current Community law should allow airlines to retain their slots."
"This exemption is proposed to tackle a crisis that is plain for all to see and which we have discussed many times."
"It should also be remembered that it is an exemption that can in some way, and I believe this is a positive thing, hinder the takeover by companies from third countries which, unlike Community carriers, are often able to benefit from State aid and other support, and I think this too should be considered."
"For the rest, my sympathies are wholly social, and my support for this initiative should be seen in that light."
"I am happy to say that those who, on the other hand, are confirmed liberalists, must this time take the complete opposite approach; who knows, they may mend their ways, which I would be very pleased to see."
"So, I take this opportunity - this will be my last speech this session and it is unlikely that I will be back here for the next parliamentary term - to thank everyone, those Members who without prejudice have allowed me to work with them and have thus undoubtedly given me an incomparable experience, both personally and politically."
"I wish you all well, and would especially like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Chairman Costa, Commissioner Tajani and all the Members of this House, and I would just like to conclude with an appeal for greater transparency, which I hope the next Parliament will truly offer, because we voted for transparency regarding the situation of the stagiaires, assistants and many of our co-workers, but it unfortunately has yet to materialise."
"Most of all, I would emphasise what we should offer in terms - I am finishing, Mr President - of transparency regarding the work we do here, since the press coverage, especially in the majority of the Italian press, is demagogical and totally absurd."
"The attendance lists should be made public, and information on the work of individual Members should be officially published by the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Romagnoli, and I wish you every success in your future work."
"(DE) Mr President, everything of importance that needs to be said on this important text for air transport and for the people who depend on air transport, either as employees or passengers, has already been said."
"Just not by me."
"So I have deliberately chosen not to repeat what has already been said, but I would like to take this opportunity to say something about the crisis."
"Mr Tajani, you pointed out that this was not the first and, unfortunately, would probably not be the last crisis in the aviation industry that we, as well as the aviation industry, would have to deal with."
"It is right that we react quickly in such critical situations and try to find sensible solutions."
"We have managed to do that."
"But we should not hide the fact that the crisis has also sometimes been used, is being used and will be used as a pretext to organise regulations that do not really serve the aviation industry or people but specific interests."
"In the Denied Boarding Directive, with its relatively imprecise wording on the issue of 'extraordinary circumstances', we gave airlines the opportunity to interpret this notion very extensively."
"That is precisely what they are doing - at the expense of passengers."
"In this directive, we also neglected to impose fines for delays."
"In the last weeks and months in particular, airlines have exploited the fact they do not have to pay for delays but basically only have to grant minimum rights to passengers - again at the expense of passengers."
"We should not make the same mistake again."
"I therefore ask that, in the next parliamentary term, you, or those who will take over this dossier, submit a proposal to change this legal text."
"On another point, this is also my last day of school in this House, as it is for many fellow Members."
"On the first day of school you normally get a school bag."
"Perhaps on the last day there will also be a bag of sweets."
"Mr Tajani, I would like to request a 'sweet'."
"Please do away with the nonsense we created at that time with the regulation on liquids and security checks at airports as quickly as possible."
"This regulation has been of benefit to no one and has protected no one."
"It has only caused anger."
"Just because no one is brave enough and resolute enough to tell people this and to carry out this abolition, we are all still suffering under this unspeakable regulation."
"Please fill this school bag and do away with this nonsense."
"I sincerely thank all of you with whom I have had the privilege of working in the last few years."
"Thank you, Mr Rack."
"Rest assured the House will miss you and we wish you all the best for the future."
"(FR) Mr President, I listened to Mr Boso just now, and I am not underestimating the fact that there are special cases, particularly in Italy, where it would be preferable today to see slots opened up."
"However, I do believe that we need to keep a cool head and recognise that the crisis is affecting the aviation sector more quickly and more profoundly than ever before."
"It is without doubt one of the first sectors to be affected by budget cuts - corporate budgets, in terms of business travellers, and household budgets, in terms of summer holidaymakers."
"The other option would have been to open up slots completely, resulting in all likelihood in a scenario where the most powerful airlines would turn their empty aeroplanes round on the best slots, would abandon the least profitable spatial-planning slots, and where the low-cost airlines, which have a different economic model, would take advantage of it to sell off a few slots."
"In short, this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances."
"It would have had nothing to do with the real economy, with a functioning market; rather, it probably would have played a part in social dumping or in the defence of positions acquired, in the case of the most powerful airlines."
"That is why I believe that this moratorium is the least worst solution, provided that it is only temporary, that the events and the impact of this crisis are closely monitored, that developments are accounted for before Parliament, and that we open up the slots market while taking the time to effect a policy change and to consolidate a new European Union policy."
"This is my final speech before this House."
"It is a great privilege, after 10 years of working in the same committee, to take the floor at what is practically the end of the parliamentary term, in one of the very last debates, and to do so among one's friends."
"I should like to say what a pleasure it has been for me to work with such strong and such brilliant personalities;"
"I shall not forget the experience."
"This committee is an elite committee, I think it must be said."
"It has done remarkable work; it is a credit to the work of Parliament, it is a credit to the European Parliament."
"I should like to thank all of my colleagues, from all of the political groups."
"I do not think that I will enjoy another such rich, honest, sincere and profound political experience as this one."
"I should also like to say to Mr Tajani that I congratulate him on having accepted such a difficult mandate and portfolio as transport during this term of office, and that, because patience and length of time are what make a person competent here, he deserves to have this portfolio reassigned to him under the Commission's next mandate. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for everything."
"Thank you, Mr Savary."
"One of the things you said about the Commission perfectly demonstrates your qualities and the effort you have made in your work in Parliament."
"I am sure that in the future you will have equally enriching experiences."
"(PL) Mr President, I am speaking straight after Mr Rack and Mr Savary, and I would like to thank both of them for their work in the European Parliament."
"I do not know if this will be my last speech here."
"It depends on the upcoming elections."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing something which is interesting because it shows the confrontation between the absolutely fundamental interest of airlines and the interest of consumers and passengers."
"At a time of crisis the airlines are saving themselves by asking for these limits, just as we have said here, to be extended into next year."
"If we help the airlines here, and I think that would be sensible, they must not do this at the cost of passengers."
"A situation in which the airlines really treat this matter as a pretext and cancel flights with impunity is a very dangerous situation."
"With Mr Rack I think that we should lift the restrictions on passenger pools, because this situation is becoming increasingly surrealistic and is very irritating."
"I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Commissioner Tajani on his very good work."
"Mr President, having heard from a number of speakers who will no longer be with us after the next election, I am hoping that the electorate in Britain will allow me to come back here for another term."
"This is the last time that I shall be speaking from this particular seat in the Chamber: I shall be relocated during the changes."
"Can I just congratulate Mr Jarzembowski in particular on the work he has done on behalf of us all in the committee, and thank Mr Tajani, and also Mr Costa for bringing this matter before us."
"Debating the suspension of the 80/20 rule is very important, but it can only be a short-term measure and it must not be allowed to become part of the aviation policy in the longer term."
"The positives are obvious: helping carriers, especially the large national flag carriers, through the present economic downturn; also, not being able to fly empty planes to fulfil slot obligations is good for the environment."
"But the solution is not in this and it must not become permanent."
"The current problems are linked to the present financial crash, but to claim the crisis in the aviation industry is wholly down to this would be wrong."
"The health of some of our flag carriers has been poor for a number of years, and they need to have a careful look at their own business models for the future."
"They must be viable business entities, not specially privileged organisations, and resorting to protectionist measures is not acceptable in general to me and to my colleagues."
"We will, of course, support the Commission in this."
"But I do not support the use of simplified procedure in the future and I think it would be a good idea for us to have a hearing on the Slot Allocation Directive, perhaps in the autumn or winter when we come back."
"We must find measures to put in place market-based incentives for airlines and airports."
"In times of difficulty, efficiency and innovation need to be rewarded - I am a fan of regional airports in particular."
"Lastly, let us just mention the plight of pilots: the suspension of 'use it or lose it' may well see some pilots out of a job."
"Speaking as a pilot myself: can the Commission please explain why the pilots' associations were not consulted in this matter, and could it also confirm that the concerns of pilots and other people working in this industry will be fully taken into account?"
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Tajani, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission has adopted, as a matter of urgency, a proposal to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on the allocation of airport slots."
"The basic aim of this proposal is to suspend the 80/20 rule or, in other words, to prevent slots purchased previously from being auctioned off where they have not been used."
"This is not intended as a principle ad eternum nor as a right of ownership - as the committee chairman, Mr Costa, has just said - but as a temporary measure."
"This suspension is based on an awareness that the economic crisis has led to a widespread decline in passenger and freight air traffic, with a substantial impact on national carriers and other economic sectors, therefore making this a worrying time for jobs."
"As a result, we have a duty not to force airlines to operate flights at significant economic and environmental cost simply to retain their slots."
"That is why I support the suspension of this 80/20 rule."
"Having said this, I must take this opportunity to question whether this approach will be sufficient to effectively respond to the global crisis affecting this sector or whether, as I believe, the Commission should consider and propose a programme of support for this sector, so that it is stable and in a position to grow after the crisis."
"We should remember that many airlines, as is the case with my country's flag carrier, having previously overcome economic crises and having consolidated financially, now find themselves in a crisis situation that will be difficult to overcome, a crisis not of their making, but from which they are suffering."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my last speech in this legislative term and could be my last overall, depending on what the voters decide."
"I could not therefore let this opportunity pass without expressing my gratitude for the support and cooperation that I have always received from my fellow Members in my modest contribution to the construction of a European project and a response to the citizens."
"I therefore want to express my thanks and gratitude, in this House, to you, Mr President, to Vice-President Tajani and to all my colleagues in my group."
"I must in particular mention those who have spoken here today - Mr Simpson and Mr Savary - and also those Members from other groups, such as the chairman of our committee, Mr Costa, with whom I have had the pleasure of working on several reports, and also Mr Jarzembowski, who I cannot miss out."
"He has led his group in this area of transport and has always been very cooperative, often rejecting my ideas, but telling me that he understood, and always with great elegance and a great sense of democracy."
"At the very least this is what I will take home with me, in order to work on what must be good democracy: the democracy of respect for pluralism and for the pursuit of our common goals."
"Thank you, Mr Fernandes."
"Let us hope that the Portuguese electorate appreciates your leadership as we do and, indeed, that you may be re-elected to your seat."
"(RO) The allocation of slots is an issue directly linked to the insufficient capacity available at airports, especially large ones."
"The economic crisis and the relative decrease in traffic caused by this only serve to put off, in the short term, dealing with the real problem, namely, the difficulties created by saturating large airport hubs and the potential saturation of small airports."
"It is our duty to find solutions to the problems which have occurred at the moment, but we must not lose sight of resolving the problems of the future either."
"Parliament has called on the European Commission to produce a coherent master plan for increasing airport capacity."
"A number of European airports have similar plans, but what is absolutely necessary is to coordinate them at European level as part of the single European sky initiative approved recently."
"I firmly believe that, as a result of setting up the European Observatory last November, this wish will come true in the near future."
"This plan is crucial for the sustainable development of the air transport sector, which is vital to the European economy."
"The issue of slots is not only a European problem."
"Traffic at European airports does not only come from Europe."
"For this reason, a global solution needs to be found for the slots issue with the support of IATA, Eurocontrol and all the other agencies concerned in this area."
"This is why I believe that the recommendation made today to the Commission by Parliament to re-examine in the near future the impact of the crisis on air traffic and to review in this context Directive 95/93 is the most suitable method which we can propose at this time of uncertainty."
"Without carrying out a thorough analysis, we risk damaging in an unacceptable way both the principle of competition, which is fundamental to the economy, and emerging airlines whose development still depends, unfortunately, on the 'use it or lose it' rule."
"The losers in this situation would primarily be passengers, something which must not happen."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard here, air transport is affected by various critical situations, including SARS and Mexican flu."
"At the same time, there has been a fall in passenger numbers."
"I would like to mention one of the factors that may be playing a part in the decrease in passenger numbers, and that is the quality and capacity of airport services, especially security checks."
"I have to say that they are not only undignified - for instance, taking off your shoes and walking barefoot through the security check - but also, in terms of hygiene, a liability and a health hazard."
"I would not be surprised if passenger numbers had declined because of fears about infection - fears which the media are currently encouraging."
"So I would like the European Union to have better control over the hygiene of safety checks in airports, so that it can improve the well-being, safety and comfort of passengers."
"As this is the last time I shall take the floor before this House, I thank you all for your cooperation and wish you every success in the future."
"I also wish you happiness for the future, Mrs Škottová."
"(CS) I would like to say that the current situation is marked, above all, by the gap between steadily improving technological capabilities and security measures which are making life difficult for airport passengers and staff alike."
"I think it is in our interests, especially in the economic crisis now making itself felt throughout the world - and probably the autumn will bring another wave of this crisis, another attack of financial insecurity - that we should do everything we can to ensure that this sector overcomes its crisis and expands."
"It is my opinion that those who have resources and do not put them to use are destined to go into decline."
"I would like the European Union to avoid such a situation, and I would like us to be at the forefront of progress where the transport sector is concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to thank you and all those Members who took part in this debate regarding a temporary measure - and I would emphasise that temporary nature - in the field of air transport."
"Most importantly, I too would like to thank all those who are leaving Parliament for the work they have done."
"(FR) I should also like to thank Mr Savary, who is no longer in the Chamber."
"I share his sentiment; I therefore hope to work with him again in the years to come, even if he is no longer an MEP."
"(IT) I sincerely thank those Members who are leaving the House for the help they have given the Commission, for their intelligent comments and also for the criticism they have offered."
"Parliament should fulfil this role, and no one is more convinced of this than I am, because I believe that, without Parliament's strong input, the European institutions would be incomplete and unable to provide the best protection for citizens' interests."
"For precisely that reason I would like to reassure Mr Jarzembowski, who asked me a question about the comitology procedure: the compromise, which has the Commission's full support, provides for the use of codecision procedure as regards possible renewal for the winter season."
"This is purely hypothetical, because, I would emphasise, the measure is a temporary one and applies for six months only."
"Nonetheless, any future proposal for renewal must always be preceded by an impact assessment, taking account of the effects on consumers and on competition."
"It will also form part of a general review of the slots regulation, to which I have made a commitment before the Council, at the request of the UK transport minister, as I have confirmed many times in this House."
"It is, however, the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention."
"Indeed, data provided by the European Airport Association tells us that 80% of European airports have seen a reduction in traffic, in January, between 8% and 10% as regards passengers, and between 25% and 30% as regards freight."
"This is therefore a difficult situation."
"I, too, share the hope and wish expressed by certain Members that the current influenza will turn out to be less serious than it was initially believed to be."
"We cannot hide the fact, though, that the proposal to suspend flights from the entire European Union to a country or to areas where the epidemic first broke out was on the agenda at last week's meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, as well as the Council of Health Ministers."
"There could be repercussions, therefore, but no decision was taken since the situation was not deemed serious enough."
"However, it is clear that there is debate in this sector; some crews have decided not to fly to areas with known cases of influenza, which has caused a further drop in air passenger numbers."
"I believe that as regards passenger rights - since it is a subject highlighted by many influential Members - the main thing is to maintain connections and frequency for the benefit precisely of citizens, and then to overcome the crisis."
"The financial soundness and sustainability of our airlines are key parameters to safeguarding the advantages of the internal market, and thanks to the internal market passengers have access to a variety of connections, routes and prices unprecedented in Europe."
"I want passengers to be able to continue to enjoy this possibility of choice."
"As regards the regulations on supervision, we must strengthen the monitoring and application of Regulation 261."
"To this end, the Commission will publish - let me address this to Mr Rack - a communication on the application of the regulation in the second half of 2009."
"On the basis of this evaluation we will draw conclusions as to the future."
"With regard to liquids, as you know, we have already published the formerly secret annex behind this, and thanks to the use of new and more effective technologies from the point of view of security, we hope to be able to review the situation before 2010."
"I was highly sceptical of the liquids affair when I was an MEP, I remain so today and I am working precisely in order to reach that objective."
"As regards the concerns expressed by other Members over certain airports that could run into problems following this measure - I refer in particular to a European airport that forms part of one of the EU's priority projects, the Malpensa airport - I can offer some information concerning airlines other than Alitalia-Air France."
"Let me read you some statistics: at Malpensa airport, a German airline, Lufthansa, had 8 741 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 19 520, an increase in capacity of more than 100%."
"Also at Malpensa, a low-cost airline, easyJet, had 15 534 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 22 936, a significant rise representing a 47% increase in capacity."
"It is also well known that the new airline Lufthansa Italia has plans, as we can read on the airline's own website, thus in the public domain, to expand its network with new flights from Milan to Rome and to the cities of Naples and Bari as well as other European cities - Barcelona, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Lisbon, Madrid and Paris."
"I can say then with absolute certainty that this measure will not cause any harm - and I say this as European Commissioner for Transport - to an airport and European hub like Malpensa, which is included in the Union's priority projects."
"I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament again for this debate, confirming what I said in my earlier speech, in reply to Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Simpson and Mr Blokland, as regards the commitment I am making today as Commissioner for Transport - and I hope to be able to do so again as future Commissioner for Transport - concerning the codecision procedure for matters relating to the issue of slots."
"Some of the ideas put forward, such as those included by the rapporteur in his initial amendments, deserve to be properly studied in the context of the future review of the regulation on the allocation of slots and - I repeat - the Commission staff, whom I thank again for the valuable contribution they have made in these weeks of difficult work, are willing to do this and are indeed in the process of drafting the new text."
"At the same time, as stipulated in the amendment we are debating today, the Commission will watch carefully to see how the air sector crisis develops and will propose measures to address this as necessary and appropriate, attaching great importance to safeguarding passenger rights."
"I will do this not only in the field of air transport but also in maritime, rail and bus and coach transport."
"This is a commitment we have made: there are legislative measures being discussed."
"I hope that the next parliamentary term can bring these to a conclusion, as our primary objective nonetheless remains to meet the needs of the people who elect this Parliament and who, through the consensus of this Parliament, rely on the European Commission, the Community executive."
"Mr President, may I also thank you, Mr Costa, and all those Members who have taken part in this debate, for their productive cooperation."
"The commitment I am making is to continue to work with Members of this House and with its Committee on Transport and Tourism to ensure that the democratic institution representing European citizens can play an increasingly influential role."
"I hope that with the Treaty of Lisbon the next Parliament will be able to make the voice of the European people heard more clearly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must simply stress three concepts."
"Firstly, on the issue in question, we came to a compromise, and a compromise must be respected."
"We know it is a compromise among institutions that keep their promises."
"It is a temporary measure and there will not be a second one: if there is a second measure it must be within the framework of an analysis and a more thorough proposal on slots."
"Just two suggestions, which I hope may be of some use: the first is to follow closely the effects of this suspension since, clearly, it will lead to a reduction of slots and mean that some slots and therefore some lines will not be used."
"The choice of what to do and what not to do will be in the hands of individual companies."
"In future, I think it would be better to consider that, if we have to reduce this activity again, then there should be public control of that choice, rather than leaving it purely to the profitability criteria of individual businesses."
"The final suggestion is that, regardless of the existence or otherwise of the crisis, the subject of slots must be addressed properly, for its own sake."
"Restoring slots to the concept of public goods that can be authorised for use but cannot become the property of companies is a fundamental issue, although it must be handled with great care so that it does not instead become an instrument that threatens the viability of many of the airlines that we all depend on."
"Thank you all again for your cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"It is also my last debate as President in this parliamentary term and I should like to thank you all."
"This debate has felt somewhat strange on account of having to say goodbye and good luck to so many colleagues."
"Whatever happens, it is my belief that it will take a good deal of work and time before the new arrivals achieve the standard of those leaving us now."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I am delighted that an agreement has been reached on this text to allow a freeze on flight slots during the summer season."
"We needed to act quickly and effectively in the face of the major crisis that is hitting the air transport sector."
"It is already the third time that, following a significant reduction in air traffic, the Union has had to use this automatic slot-renewal mechanism."
"As we have recently discovered, the rule on the obligation to fill 80% of slots, while necessary for the balance of the sector, is at times removed from the reality of the market."
"Having empty planes take off makes no sense from an economic or an environmental perspective."
"In future, we will be able to reflect on ways of relaxing this rule while taking the situation of airports into account."
"Furthermore, I am pleased to note that the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Council calls for a full impact assessment to be carried out if the freeze on slots is renewed."
"The text on which we are voting is an emergency measure, but if the situation were to continue, we would have to consider the situation not only of airlines, but also of consumers and airports."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.23 a.m. pending voting time and resumed at 12 noon)"
"We are about to begin a rather special vote, since, for all those who, like me, are due to leave Parliament, I think that this final moment spent together will be somewhat emotional."
"I am going to take advantage of the time left us by some of our fellow Members who have arrived late and are taking their seats to pay tribute to the services, which have ensured that our Tower of Babel has never come crashing down."
"(Loud applause)"
"Thank you to Birgitte Stensballe and to all of her team; to the ushers, who make sure that the documents always arrive at the right place, at the right time; to the technicians; to the secretaries; and to the translators."
"Obviously, thank you to the interpreters, to whom I offer my humblest apologies."
"I know the stress I have caused you as President by running through items very quickly."
"(Applause)"
"I know that you secretly hope that my record of 900 amendments voted on in one hour will never be beaten!"
"To conclude, I am going to let you in on a little secret, just while the last few Members take their seats."
"You perhaps wonder how we classify our amendments: is Amendment X, written in Latvian, closer to the original Portuguese text than Amendment Y, written in Slovenian?"
"Who is responsible for this classification?"
"Well, the answer is sitting next to me."
"It is this gentleman who has the formidable task of carrying out this semantic classification."
"Why entrust it to him?"
"Quite simply because Paul Dunstan speaks 27 languages."
"(Applause)"
"I believe that we can all be very proud of the quality and dedication of our staff."
"Mr President, I rise under Rule 145 in order to make a personal statement."
"Yesterday, during the debate with President Pöttering, Mr Farage - during a harangue he gave Parliament - accused me of calling him 'reactionary'."
"I have to say to Parliament that this is entirely true - he is a reactionary!"
"(Laughter)"
"That is as nothing compared to the comments I have had from members of his party in e-mails."
"I have been described by members of UKIP as a 'paedophile' and a 'big fat git'."
"Indeed, when I had a bomb in my office, UKIP members wrote to me, and Mr Farage put out a press release, basically saying that it was what I deserved."
"Recently I have had UKIP e-mails telling me that the heir to the British throne is better known as 'Big Ears'."
"That tells you all you need to know about the UK Independence Party."
"(Applause)"
"Your personal statement is of course recorded, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"If you do not mind, ladies and gentlemen, we shall not re-open the debate."
"I will give you 30 seconds, but I warn you that it will be 30 seconds only, as a gesture of goodwill, because these really are the last few moments of the parliamentary term."
"Mr President, that was not a point of order and most of it was rubbish."
"UKIP people do not write that kind of stuff, and they do not waste their pens on the kind of person that says that kind of thing."
"That is absolutely outrageous."
"I would inform you that it was indeed a point of order, under Rule 145 on personal statements."
"Mr Titley's request to take the floor before our House was fully justified."

"Gender mainstreaming in EU external relations ("
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the EU and its Member States have committed themselves to pursuing gender equality and women's empowerment as one of the key priorities of the international agenda."
"Yet, closer inspection reveals that the practical implementation of gender mainstreaming in the EU's external policies is still weak."
"For instance, only eight of the 27 Member States have adopted national action plans on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325."
"Furthermore, women are still seriously underrepresented in high-level posts in the Commission and the Council."
"In fact, there is not a single female EU special representative at the moment."
"For this reason, the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field."
"For instance, the Commission should speed up its work on an EU action plan on gender equality."
"I am convinced that this is key to strengthening the gender dimension in EU foreign policy."
"Let me conclude by saying that women's rights are part of the broader concept of human and civic rights."
"Without addressing gender equality and promoting women's rights in the EU's foreign policy, that policy cannot be effective."
"(Applause)"

"Parliament's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Lisbon Treaty ("
"- Before the vote"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say just a few words in German."
"The fact that, to round off its work in this parliamentary term, this House has adopted five reports, all of which are connected with the Treaty of Lisbon, is an important signal for the European elections and for the time after that."
"This House has always worked continuously and consistently for the Reform Treaty, even in times of difficulty and when many had doubts and even wanted to abandon the project."
"Yesterday, with the 'yes' in the Czech Senate, we took a huge step forward."
"Congratulations to the country that has the Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"We may now be justifiably optimistic that this reform project will enter into force at the end of 2009 with a positive vote in Ireland."
"The newly elected European Parliament will have many new powers and capabilities."
"This newly elected Chamber of Citizens in the European Union can fulfil the promise we have made to achieve a better EU with more democratic control and more transparency."
"I thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, especially today's rapporteurs and the overwhelming majority of Members in this House who supported all the reports and made this progress possible. Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Our fellow Member, Hans-Peter Martin, has asked to take the floor; it really must be for a point of order."
"(DE) Mr President, I have just one question."
"If the Irish say 'no' again, how often must they keep going to the polls?"
"A third, fourth, fifth time?"
"That is not democracy, it is a karaoke parliament."
"It was not a point of order, but I had the good grace not to make a martyr of you."
"Mr President, I want to make a personal statement in relation to what Mr Martin just said."
"The Irish Parliament is not a 'karaoke parliament', and I object to it being described as such by that man."
"(Applause)"

"Financial aspects of the Lisbon Treaty ("
"- Before the vote"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are going to be disappointed."
"You are going to be disappointed by the brevity of my speech."
"Firstly, I should like us to make a technical correction to footnote 2 in paragraph 16; the last figure is '2021', not '2022'."
"It is a question of arithmetic."
"I would also like to say a few political words in order, firstly, to thank all those who have supported me in the drafting of this report - it may seem extremely technical to you, but it is eminently political."
"It is very important that our Parliament vote in favour of this report, because it clarifies the future budgetary powers of Parliament as a budgetary authority."
"Often, you vote on the budget as a management tool, when in fact it is the very essence of politics, and Parliament's role depends on its being implemented."
"That is what we wished to cover in this report;"
"I hope that you will read it one day."
"May I say, however, that the new MEPs will have to grab hold of it and realise that making a European policy takes budgetary courage and that it is on this courage - which I hope they will all have and we will all have - that the future of the Union depends."

"Human rights in the world 2008 and the EU's policy on the matter ("
"- Before the vote"
"(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats I would like to ask you, pursuant to Article 151(1) and (3), to reject Amendment 45a, tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, as inadmissible insofar as it deals with the statement made by Pope Benedict for the following reasons."
"First, this statement was made in 2009, while the report deals with human rights violations that took place in 2008."
"This amendment does not therefore amend the text it is intended to amend."
"Second, this amendment compares the statements made by the Pope with human rights violations of the most serious kind, the use of the death penalty, human rights violations in China, and torture everywhere."
"This comparison shows a cynical disregard for the victims of human rights violations throughout the world."
"(Applause)"
"Third, it is such an unbelievable aspersion, such an unbelievable discrimination against the Pope that the ALDE Group may well be identified with it, but under no circumstances should the European Parliament be."
"(Loud applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to give you the opinion of the legal service and of the President of the European Parliament, since he has of course been consulted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"(FR) Mr President, I just wanted to say, on a legal note, to Mr Nassauer, that the Pope does not count the years, for he counts eternity."
"Please, please ..."
"The legal service has checked this carefully, from a technical perspective, from the perspective of the elements mentioned, from a content perspective and from the perspective of the period under examination."
"The legal service is of the opinion that the amendment is admissible, and this is also the opinion of the President of the European Parliament."
"It is therefore the opinion of Mr Pöttering only that shall prevail."
"Thus, I am sorry, Mr Nassauer, but the amendment is admissible."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 25"
"Mr President, I wish to refer strictly to an update of information, because the text was condemning the imprisonment of a Sudanese leader who has been released."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Nassauer, the right to self-determination is a human right and that includes sexual self-determination."
"To that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate."
"I will read Amendment 2 aloud."
"On the one hand, it is about a correction of fact and, on the other, a somewhat more balanced formulation:"
"'Underlines the importance of promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, as a precondition for any successful fight against HIV/AIDS, which causes enormous loss in terms of human lives and economic development, affecting particularly the poorest regions in the world; is concerned about declarations made by Pope Benedict XVI, which create the impression that condom use could even lead to an increased risk of contagion; is of the opinion that those statements will severely hamper the fight against HIV/AIDS;'."
"The remainder of the amendment remains unchanged."
"(Applause from the left)"
"(DE) Mr President, the amendment is not as rude in tone as the prototype but the facts are unchanged."
"We therefore reject the oral amendment."
"(The oral amendment was not accepted)"
"After the vote on Amendment 16"
"Mr President, forgive me for interrupting your chairing, but my understanding was that Amendment 16 was actually rejected, and yet you announced it was adopted."
"Could you just clarify the situation?"
"Yes, please excuse me, it was a slip of the tongue."
"Indeed, the majority was against."
"It was worth having it checked, but the services had already rectified my mistake."
"Thank you for your point."

"It was in that sense that I agreed to this amendment."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire Commission for their very close cooperation and to point out how important it is that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, we have close interinstitutional cooperation from the very beginning."
"That is why I would also stress that, in the period of transition from Nice to Lisbon, we need to remain in close consultation with the European Council as well if we want to avoid beginning the next term in a state of absolute confusion."
"I can in fact confirm that Amendment 1 is tabled as an addition."

"It is true that we are coming to the final vote - may I say a few personal words of thanks to you for your confidence and for the friendship you have shown me for so long."
"For the last time in this parliamentary term, and for the last time in my existence, I am therefore going to ask you to vote."
"We shall then go our separate ways."
"I am convinced that, our political differences and our paths aside, we shall all remain true to Europe's ideals, but you should know that, from my perspective, to have had the good fortune to chair these debates, in this collegial atmosphere, for 10 years will forever remain a very great honour in my life."

"(DE) Mr President, the new role of Parliament after the Treaty of Lisbon will be very important, and I hope that Parliament will seize the opportunities it is given to the best of its ability."
"As a member of an ethnic minority traditionally present in the European Union, I am particularly pleased that the rights of ethnic minorities are mentioned as individual rights for the first time in Article 2."
"I hope that group rights will follow as quickly as possible."
"I am retiring voluntarily, of my own volition, but not without a feeling of nostalgia after five years as a Member of this Parliament and fifteen years as a Member of Parliament in Rome."
"As an Italian national, with German as my mother tongue, of Austrian Slovene descent, with a Tyrolean nature - a proper European - I have been particularly pleased that we are all reunited in this Chamber as minorities and that minorities have been given opportunities."
"Many have not yet really sensed that they belong to a minority, but I hope they will feel this more and more, including the States."
"I am grateful to this House for the understanding for minorities that has been forthcoming."
"(LT) I voted in favour of Mr Leinen's report and resolution for the following reasons."
"We are used to repeating that the European Parliament is the only European Union institution which is directly elected by the people."
"However, given that it is an institution elected by the people, in my opinion the European Parliament's powers have until now been insufficient."
"Therefore, I think that what we have adopted today, that is, Parliament's new powers when applying the codecision procedure, new budget management powers, the new approval procedure, and new supervisory powers, is very important."
"I also think that the Treaty of Lisbon will strengthen the European Union's democratic legitimacy, especially when increasing Parliament's powers to apply the codecision procedure."
"Mr President, now I understand what the tactic is: it is simply to disregard the votes and implement the Lisbon Treaty as though the electorates of France, the Netherlands and Ireland had in fact voted 'yes'."
"One by one, its most contentious articles and provisions are being brought in: the foreign minister and the foreign policy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the harmonisation of justice and home affairs."
"Then colleagues are going to turn around to the Irish electorate and say: 'It is too late to vote ""no” now, because we have implemented the whole thing, so all you would be doing is annoying everybody and isolating yourselves when, in fact, the bulk of the Lisbon Treaty is already in force de facto, if not de jure.'"
"I do not know whether that is going to work."
"That is going to be up to the Irish electorate, but I would be rather disappointed if they gave in to pressure."
"It is, of course, for them to take their own decision, but these are, after all, people whose fathers saw off the might of the British Empire."
"If they now give in to the European Parliament, I think they would be diminished as a people."
"Mr President, may I also add to the growing numbers of tributes that were paid to you earlier on."
"Thank you very much for your chairmanship and your patience whenever we have risen to speak."
"I think it is very important that we recognise, when it comes to the Lisbon Treaty, that it has not been ratified yet, and we should not behave as if it has been ratified."
"We should not ignore the will of the voters who have not yet ratified it and those countries that have not yet ratified it."
"Let us also remember the rules at the start of the game and let us not try to change the rules half-way through."
"At the start of the constitutional process the rules were that every country had to ratify or it fell."
"France and the Netherlands failed to ratify so the Constitution fell."
"Also with the Lisbon Treaty, the rules at the beginning were that every country has to ratify, otherwise it falls."
"Yet when the Irish people voted 'no' we decided to continue and to make them vote again."
"If you really want the will of the people to follow this, then I suggest to the British Government that they meet their manifesto commitment and have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr President, the Irish people will certainly be very foolish if they follow the sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party."
"I can assure Mr Hannan that the Irish people will not - and have never - followed the sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party."
"Its agenda is not even in the best interests of Britain - it is in the best interests of the Conservative Party."
"It is a disgrace that a country that gave us Winston Churchill has sent these people to this Parliament to put their own narrow interests before the interests of the British people and the interests of Europe."
"It is strange to see these British Conservatives bedfellows of the abstentionist Sinn Fein party, neither of whom have been in this House today or yesterday."
"They do not turn up to this House."
"They do not participate in the committees of the House."
"How they draw their salary and expenses, I do not know, but they told this House that to approve this and other reports was the worst thing to happen in this term, and then they do not even come here to vote."
"That is an absolute disgrace."
"Mr President, after 15 years this will be my last speech in the European Parliament and I think there are few more important issues than the whole question of asylum and how European countries face this challenge."
"There is no easy response to this issue either."
"If there was, some country would have found it by now."
"In reality, I would suggest that the only way to reduce the number of desperate people who seek refuge or asylum in a country other than their own is to address the root causes that force them to leave their homes and countries of origin."
"That is why it is so important that we in the EU, and in all developed democratic countries, offer advice, help and support - including financial support - to those countries that are affected by war, internal violence, lack of human rights or discrimination."
"Equally, we have to address the poverty around the world which contributes to migratory pressures."
"We should never condemn people who are forced to seek asylum or refugee status."
"Instead, we should offer sympathy and offer our support."
"That is our challenge today."
"Mr President, the right to control your borders is a defining attribute of statehood and the bestowal of residence or nationality rights is a characteristic of nationality."
"When we transfer that from national to European level, we are treating the EU as a single jurisdiction with its own external borders and the other trappings of nationality."
"This has no mandate: nobody has voted for this creation of a European Asylum Office."
"But, of course, what we are doing is creating a new bureaucracy, which will now have a vested interest in the continuous harmonisation of policy at European level down the years, with or without any popular support."
"I must just respond - on a different subject - to the words spoken and aimed at me by Gay Mitchell, the MEP for Dublin, a second ago."
"He threw Winston Churchill at me and said it was a disgrace for the party of Churchill to be sending to Strasbourg people like me."
"Let me finish my speech by quoting Churchill himself on the subject."
"He said: 'We have our own dream and our own task."
"We are with Europe but not of it."
"We are linked but not combined."
"We are interested and associated but not absorbed."
"And should European statesmen address us in the words that were used of old, ""Shall I speak for thee to the King or the Captain of the Host?”, we should reply with the Shunamite woman ""Nay, sir, for we dwell among our own people”.'"
"(FI) Mr President, very briefly I would like to say that I voted in favour of Mrs Hieronymi's report."
"I also wish to thank Mrs Hieronymi for having done such excellent work in the Committee on Culture and Education in the area of audiovisual issues."
"I know that she is to leave Parliament and that this was her last report for us in the European Parliament, at least for a while."
"It is very important that the audiovisual component of the MEDIA Mundus programme is extended to make it accessible for third countries as well, including the African states."
"This is a way to broaden cooperation."
"This is also an excellent form of development cooperation and a way to encourage these countries to move towards a better life and better development."
"This is also a means whereby we can assume an ethical responsibility, as is only right, for the African nations."
"Most of all, however, this speech of mine is a thank you to Mrs Hieronymi for her marvellous work."
"Mr President, I rise in support of the Costa report."
"However, I am concerned, and I wanted to bring to the attention of this House how provisions like these are being used to stifle competition rather than protect airlines, the purpose of this legislation."
"It is not unusual for airlines to hoard airport slots."
"Let me share an example with you: Birmingham airport in my constituency."
"We have seen the suspension of direct flights to Amritsar by Air India."
"This highly popular and profitable service was cancelled last October, forcing customers into unnecessary travel and inconvenience to go to other airports, the reason being that Air India did not want to lose its highly valuable Heathrow slots."
"It really takes your breath away that there are plenty of other airlines who would be filling to fill the slots but are unable to because Air India is holding onto them."
"What I hope will happen as a result of this is that we will ensure that airlines do not hold on to slots unnecessarily."
"The Commission needs to be vigilant that this legislation is not misused."
"It is not just that I have a suspicious mind, but the chances are that the consumer will be left with precious few choices."
"(RO) The situation in the Republic of Moldova is now clear."
"We have a Communist party which is behaving in exactly the same way as the Soviet-style Communist parties which enslaved half of Europe in the 20th century."
"We have an opposition inspired by democracy which is fighting for a Republic of Moldova attached to European values."
"The resolution which we voted on today sends a powerful political signal to Chişinău, but this signal must be clearly backed up by specific actions from the Commission and the Council."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to actively cooperate with the democratic opposition in Chişinău to find effective ways of strengthening democratic awareness in the Republic of Moldova."
"The most effective way of doing this, in my view, is to lift the visa requirements for citizens from the Republic of Moldova within the Community."
"I would like to clearly say to the Council that we must not be under any illusion."
"The key to democratisation in the Republic of Moldova still lies in Moscow."
"The European Union must take action to reduce this influence."
"In fact, history shows us that these actions must be vigorous."
"The citizens of Moldova are expecting from the European Union exactly what the citizens of Eastern Europe were expecting from the West before 1989."
"(LT) I voted for the resolution on the situation in Moldova, because on 5 April I was one of the international observers who monitored the parliamentary elections in that country."
"We all witnessed the unrest which occurred after the elections in Moldova, but one month on from the elections, I think that it is particularly important to emphasise once more that relations between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova must continue to be developed and that we want this as we strive for greater European stability, security and well-being, and as we strive for new dividing lines."
"However, the European Union's cooperation with Moldova must go hand in hand with a genuine and clear obligation on the part of Moldova's governing institutions to strive for democracy and to honour human rights."
"(LT) I am really delighted with the result of the vote on the resolution on the report about the global human rights situation in 2008."
"I am particularly pleased with the position demonstrated by Parliament when voting on the second amendment, which discussed Pope Benedict XVI."
"I feel that the language, propositions and vocabulary used in that amendment are completely unacceptable and I would find it hard to imagine a situation where this Parliament could end its legislative term by adopting a statement which condemns Pope Benedict XVI for his statements and for the teachings of the Church."
"I therefore congratulate Parliament on adopting this document, an important document on the global human rights situation last year, which underlines the most important problems - capital punishment, torture, brutal, inhumane behaviour, the situation of human rights defenders, the situation of women's and children's rights and many other matters."
"- (DE) Mr President, I am very grateful to this House for rejecting the scandalous attack on the Pope by the Liberals."
"Even in the somewhat more carefully chosen words of Mr Graf Lambsdorff it would have been a scandalous statement."
"I have to say quite clearly that attempts are being made in this House to place the highest moral authority of the 21st century, which extends far beyond the billion Catholics and provides support for Europe and the entire world, on an equal footing with torturers, human rights abusers and dictators."
"These are unheard of matters in hand and will return to haunt the Liberal Group and also the German FDP Party."
"Mr President, whenever we discuss human rights we seem to be talking about a virtual EU: a European Union that exists only in Parliament resolutions, Commission press releases and Council communiqués."
"It is that wonderful, peaceful, human rights EU that spreads its values not through daisy-cutter bombs but rather through trade accords and partnership agreements."
"However, I feel it is incumbent on somebody to stand back and ask where this European Union is in the real world."
"In the real world, Brussels is seeking to sell arms to the Communist regime in Beijing and isolating Taiwan, it is cosying up to the Ayatollahs in Tehran, it is refusing to do business with the anti-Castro dissidents in Cuba and it is trying to funnel cash to Hamas."
"It is running protectorates - or satrapies as they were in Ottoman days - in Bosnia and in Kosovo, and within its own borders it is disregarding the will of the people in referendums."
"Perhaps when we respect that basic right of being able to change your government through the ballot box and change public policy through your vote within the European Union, then we will have earned the moral authority to lecture others."
"Mr President, one of the issues that concerns a number of my constituents in London is the massive erosion of civil liberties that we have seen in Britain under the Labour Government since 1997."
"What concerns them even more is when I tell them about the massive erosion of civil liberties arising at the EU level."
"We have seen a number of treaties, such as the Prüm Treaty, that have caused great concern."
"Fortunately, a recent ruling by the ECJ forced the British Government to hand back the data and profiles of people who were proven innocent, when the Government wanted to keep hold of them."
"However, the decision by the British Government to only remove the profiles of innocent people after at least six years shows that it has scant regard for our freedoms."
"The decision highlights that in Britain 'innocent until proven guilty' is treated as a dismissible sound bite, rather than as a fundamental precept of our society."
"It is bad enough that British police forces have access to this large amount of data and personal information, but other European governments will be able to access it too."
"The Prüm Treaty was forced into European law without proper democratic scrutiny."
"It was thought that over 3.5 million people could now have their personal information flung around the EU."
"This will fill few people with confidence."
"Mr President, I know this place has little concept of what the people of Europe actually want."
"It much prefers to tell them how we feel what they should want."
"I am being unkind;"
"I guess Members in this place do understand what our electors want and how they feel about Europe."
"However, many of us in this place simply do not care."
"They do not care about listening to minorities in this place who believe that the EU is heading in the wrong direction, and they certainly do not care to take on board the votes across the EU that go against them in referenda."
"They do not care if they get their way by governments - like the one in the UK - lying to their electorate, getting a false mandate, promising a referendum on these matters and then reneging on that promise."
"What people do care about here is time."
"Why?"
"Why the big rush to get the Lisbon Treaty ratified across the 27 Member States?"
"The answer is very simple: to deny the British people a say on this matter."
"I leave this place today, hopefully to go back to my Member State Parliament, the House of Commons, to represent people in Woodford Halse, Daventry, Long Buckby, Guilsborough, Brixworth, Earls Barton and elsewhere across the constituency known as Daventry."
"They are people who have had enough of being ignored by the current UK Government, by people in this place and by the European Commission."
"Should I get to the House of Commons, I will not rest until my constituents have their say on this Treaty."
"Fortunately, I am led to believe that that vote in the UK will come quite quickly."
"So rush through what you like here."
"The people of Britain will get their say."
"Mr President, I would like to make an explanation of vote on the Brok report: firstly, as a tribute to the work that Mr Brok has done in this institution; secondly, to show my support for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, but, more importantly, to urge my Government, when the Lisbon Treaty is ratified and when we have an extra seat coming to the United Kingdom, to allocate that seat to the people of Gibraltar."
"I am proud to have represented Gibraltar for the past five years in this Parliament and I am happy to continue."
"But I honestly have to say that it is difficult for the seven Members who have been elected to represent Gibraltar to do full justice over the range of issues that come to us: human rights, whistle-blowing, pensions, cross-border pollution and, of course, bilateral relations with Spain."
"Some people argue that the numbers do not work."
"It will be giving up too much to give Gibraltar a seat."
"Well, for many years in this institution Denmark gave a seat to Greenland."
"Greenland has around twice the population of Gibraltar."
"Denmark gave 8% of its seats to 50 000 people."
"I am asking the British Government to give less than 1.5% of its seats to the 26 000 people in Gibraltar."
"Mr President, in 10 years in this Chamber I have listened to an awful lot of humbug, but I do not think I have ever heard such unadulterated piffle as I heard in the debate on this report yesterday from Paleo-federalists such as Mr Brok and Mr Corbett, canting about the sovereignty of national parliaments as though they cared about it."
"The sovereignty of a parliament is shorthand for the sovereignty of the people."
"It is not there to guarantee the privileges of national parliamentarians."
"When we elect a parliament we entrust it with the safeguarding of our liberties for a temporary and contingent period."
"National parliamentarians have no right to make permanent derogations to those freedoms without going back and asking for an explicit mandate from the people."
"We have 646 Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom."
"638 of them were elected on the basis of an explicit promise that they would put the European Constitution to a referendum before they ratified it."
"When we hear all this stuff about how the European Constitution is now legal because all these parliamentarians have gone ahead with it, that does not invalidate the case for a referendum: it invalidates the case for representative democracy as it is."
"If you want to restore honour and meaning and purpose to our existing systems of representative government, we should trust the people and give them their referendum - as we promised."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"

"Greater integration of women in politics, particularly in external relations and diplomacy, is essential to the successful implementation of the EU's external policies, including in the areas of aid, development, enlargement, neighbourhood policy, conflict resolution, security and peace-building, and international trade."
"Despite a number of policy documents adopted at EU level on gender equality and women's rights, the practical commitment to this issue is still weak and the budgetary resources earmarked specifically for gender issues are insufficient."
"It is important to underline that gender mainstreaming requires not only high-level policy statements but also the political will of the leadership of the EU and Member States."
"in writing. - British Conservative MEPs fully support a policy of equal opportunity and non-discrimination of women in all areas of public and commercial life."
"However, this document is over-prescriptive in its approach and tries to micromanage all areas of external action including setting up an EU Institute of Gender Equality without recognising the strides made by all EU institutions to make every opportunity available to female staff."
"The report talks of benchmarks and objectives highly suggestive of quotas in all but name, and advocates deploying women on ESDP missions without clarifying their combatant status."
"Therefore, British Conservatives abstained on this report."
"Parliament voted today on a report on its new role and responsibilities in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The report gathers opinions from different committees concerning the changes that the Treaty of Lisbon will entail."
"The report welcomes the fact that Parliament will have more influence on the EU's legislative work."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"However, our votes should not in any way be seen as us pre-empting the individual Member States' ratification processes."
"We fully respect each Member State's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - The European Parliament has no role or responsibility to implement the Lisbon Treaty."
"Why not?"
"Because the treaty has not come into force: indeed, it was rejected comprehensively by Irish voters last year."
"Therefore, to talk about the European Parliament's new role and responsibilities in implementing the Lisbon treaty is breathtakingly arrogant and symptomatic of the institutional imperviousness to democratic opinion that characterises the EU."
"I hope that when Irish voters go to the polls later this year they will reject the Lisbon Treaty again."
"The leader of my party, the Conservative Party, David Cameron, is committed to holding a national referendum on the Lisbon Treaty if it has not already entered into force."
"I would therefore hope that the people of Britain could have the chance to drive the final nail into the coffin of this wretched treaty."
"British Conservatives believe in a very different vision of the EU to the one represented by the Lisbon Treaty, and we are rightly forming a new political group in the European Parliament to champion our vision."
"I voted for Mr Leinen's report."
"This report presents a detailed analysis of the new powers of the European Parliament in light of the Treaty of Lisbon, particularly the new codecision powers, new budgetary powers, new consent procedure, new powers of scrutiny, new rights to be informed and new rights of citizens."
"The end result is that the European Parliament will reinforce its powers, particularly on codecision, and increase its ability to influence decision-making, thus enhancing the democratic legitimacy of the European Union."
"This resolution forms part of a package of five resolutions, adopted today by Parliament, which shows the clearest possible contempt for the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, who rejected the European Constitution and the so-called Treaty of Lisbon."
"It also forms part of the anti-democratic process and campaign aiming to impose this unacceptable draft Treaty."
"With total disregard for the democratic will expressed by these peoples and for the provisions enshrined in the Treaties themselves - which the combined forces of the right and social democrats adopted - they are forcing the Irish people to vote in a new referendum (at the same time as preventing other people from being consulted in this way)."
"They are also increasing the pressure and interference in order to force acceptance of this Treaty, which will increase the federalism, neoliberalism and militarism of the EU."
"Such is our hypocritical and cynical European democracy."
"The same people who, ignoring what has been said (like the Portuguese Socialist Party and the Portuguese Social Democratic Party), have denied their peoples a debate and popular consultation by means of a referendum on the proposed Treaty of Lisbon, and who only respect the popular will when it is in line with their own, are now asking the people in each EU Member State to place their trust in them and vote for them in the imminent elections to the European Parliament ..."
"It is simply barefaced cheek ..."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected in the referendum in Ireland."
"Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses."
"This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU."
"Mr Leinen's report on the new roles of the European Parliament includes steps towards a United States of Europe - as implied by the Treaty of Lisbon - and also proposes that the EU now moves into the area of education as well, including sport and so on."
"It would have been desirable if the report had instead dealt with the problem of this Parliament's lack of democratic legitimacy."
"We are once again heading for an election in which voter turnout is predicted to be very low."
"The electorate in the Member States still feels little involvement with the super-centralist European Parliament."
"For as long as the political debates of representative democracy are focused on the elections to the national parliaments, it should be the national parliaments that are the highest decision-making bodies within the Union - not the European Parliament."
"I have voted against the draft report."
"in writing. - Why are we even talking about the Lisbon Treaty when it has yet to come into effect?"
"Why are we effectively ignoring the democratic will of the Irish people, who voted to reject the treaty a year ago?"
"The reason, of course, is that the EU cares very little for democratic opinion and is determined to move rapidly towards ever-closer union despite a lack of popular legitimacy."
"Irish voters will have to vote yet again on this treaty because the EU simply does not take no for an answer."
"The chasm between the EU and its citizens is growing all the time."
"Referring to the Lisbon Treaty as though it were a fact of life merely serves to reinforce this democratic deficit."
"For this reason, and many others, I am pleased that British Conservatives will be part of a new political group in the next parliament, dedicated to reforming the EU and challenging the prevailing orthodoxy of ever-closer union which has proved so unpopular and caused so much damage in my region of North-East England."
"We have voted in favour of the report on the financial aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon, which deals with the form the budget procedure will take if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"We do not support the parts of the report that deal with the EU having its own resources through power of taxation."
"We also oppose the establishment of flexibility mechanisms."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected in the referendum in Ireland."
"Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses."
"This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU."
"I do not believe that the European Parliament should have greater influence on the EU budget."
"During my time in Parliament I have noted time after time how the federalist majority wishes to liberally hand out grants for everything from cultural projects to structural support and increased EU bureaucracy."
"According to the majority in the European Parliament, all the different interest groups within regional politics, the fisheries sector and agriculture must get a share of the EU's pie."
"In some cases the expenditure is nothing but a PR stunt."
"This liberal expenditure policy is being conducted by the EU at a time of financial crisis when Member States are having to cut their expenditure on health care, schools and welfare."
"Most importantly, it is fortunate that the European Parliament has not so far had too great an influence on the EU's agricultural policy."
"If it had, the EU would end up mired in protectionism and heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural sector."
"I have voted against the report."
"in writing. - UK Conservatives have voted against the asylum package as, while we believe in cooperation in this area, we do not believe in a communitarised approach to asylum and immigration policy."
"We believe that the protection of national borders for us remains a key element of public policy at national level."
"A fortnight ago the European Parliament adopted a report on a common immigration policy for Europe, thus paving the way for what had already been planned by the European Commission: mass immigration."
"Today it is the turn of asylum seekers; the idea is to establish a 'Europe of asylum'."
"Indeed, the clearly stated objective is to ensure higher standards of treatment for asylum seekers with regard to their reception conditions."
"That means not only standardising minimum reception conditions among all the Member States but also providing support for asylum seekers to settle in huge numbers."
"To this end, the scope of this future directive will be extended to all persons legally or illegally entering European Union territory."
"The administrative restrictions that exist in the Member States with regard to labour market access will have to be completely abolished."
"Social, medical, psychological and housing assistance, as well as legal assistance, will have to be provided by the hosting Member State."
"Refusal of such assistance will be subject to legal appeals and investigations...that is often not the case for nationals themselves ..."
"By adopting this second phase of the 'asylum package', Brussels is facilitating and encouraging global immigration to Europe."
"We shall always oppose this internationalist vision, the sole aim of which is purely and simply to destroy the peoples and nations of Europe."
"For the last vote of this parliamentary term we are being asked to give our verdict on the asylum package."
"This marks the end of a process carried out throughout this term of office."
"While some progress has been made, the differences among the Member States unfortunately still exist with regard to the recognition of the status of refugees."
"Evidence of this is the limits that can be seen in the directive on the reception conditions of asylum seekers."
"Again, it is the Member States that are on the front line, to the detriment of the European unity that we require in this area."
"I hope that, during the next parliamentary term, at second reading, we shall be able to reverse this state of affairs in order to create a real European asylum law guaranteeing real protection for these particularly vulnerable men and women."
"We Conservatives have today voted in favour of Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert's report on criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for applications for international protection lodged by third-country nationals or stateless persons."
"We are aware of and understand that the large influx of people by boat via the Mediterranean puts some of the smaller countries on the southern maritime border of the EU in a difficult situation, and agree that something must be done to resolve the situation."
"It is important that the so-called suspension mechanism is not formulated such that there is a risk of removing the incentive for Member States to improve the standard of the asylum and reception process, which would be contrary to the fundamental idea behind the joint regulation."
"We Social Democrats welcome any initiative that improves the situation of asylum seekers and people with no documents."
"We advocate a generous common asylum and immigration policy centred on people's needs in accordance with the commitments made by the Member States in the Geneva Convention."
"Although the 'asylum package' involves some good steps being taken, we have decided to vote against the reports by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and Mr Masip Hidalgo."
"We Social Democrats object to the policy on asylum and immigration that is being conducted by the right-leaning majority in the European Parliament."
"In particular, we distance ourselves from the matter of oral information not having to be given in a language they understand, of detention not having to take place within the framework of the Geneva Convention, of medical examination in order to establish age and the matter of free legal assistance."
"We also consider it regrettable that the right does not wish to give asylum seekers the right to enter the labour market within six months."
"in writing. - The establishment of this office is yet another step towards a common EU asylum and immigration policy, which is a policy I totally reject."
"I believe that the issue of whom to allow into the United Kingdom should be the responsibility of elected parliamentarians and accountable ministers in the United Kingdom, not the responsibility of the EU."
"Handing the EU control of asylum and immigration policy would be deeply inimical to our national interest and would potentially expose us to greater risks from terrorism and organised crime."
"The progress towards a common asylum and immigration policy is another sign of the EU's determination to create a single political entity with uniform rules for everyone."
"That's not the vision that British Conservatives have for the EU, and we will be promoting a very different vision of the EU when we form a new political grouping in the next parliament."
"All the asylum-related reports voted on today offer a lax and extensive interpretation of the right to asylum that is ultimately detrimental to those who are in genuine need of international protection, in order to save their lives, their physical integrity and their freedom."
"The new social, financial, family and other rights that you wish to force the Member States to grant to asylum seekers will act as a magnet for all would-be economic immigrants, will further overwhelm the services in charge of these problems, and will further slow down the examination of case files."
"All this, because you repeatedly refuse to take into account the abuses and the violations of procedures, and because you persist in confusing the rights and the status that recognised refugees could have with that which you wish to grant to ordinary asylum seekers."
"Most unacceptable of all, though, is the Lambert report, which creates a European 'support' office that will be able to distribute asylum seekers among the Member States as it pleases."
"We are not against intergovernmental cooperation in these areas, where respect is shown for the sovereign right of the Member States to decide who may enter their territory, and under which conditions, but we are against your policies."
"I voted for the Zwiefka report as I believe it is very important to establish a procedure allowing Member States to negotiate international agreements on matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Community, in cases in which the Community has decided not to exercise its competence."
"In other words, at the moment Portugal is prevented from concluding international agreements to speed up judicial cooperation, including on issues relating to divorce and annulment of marriages, as the Community is considered to have partially acquired exclusive competence over these areas."
"This proposal allows the Commission to authorise the conclusion of such agreements, provided that the Community itself does not intend to conclude or has not concluded an agreement on the same subject with a third country."
"I feel that it is very important that this regulation be negotiated as quickly as possible, as it is in the interests not only of Portuguese citizens but also of all citizens in the rest of Europe."
"The relationships that have developed between the audiovisual industries of the EU Member States and those of third countries must continue and must be strengthened in the interest not only of professionals but also of consumers."
"The audiovisual cooperation programme MEDIA Mundus, as adopted today by the European Parliament, and which I support, comes under this objective."
"Indeed, it provides an appropriate framework with which to improve the competitiveness and transnational distribution of audiovisual works worldwide."
"Initiated as it was by the European Parliament, this programme should also help to promote cultural diversity while giving real added value to the actions already carried out in this area by the Union and the Member States."
"Thanks to the efforts made by our rapporteur to reach an agreement at first reading, new commercial opportunities should soon arise and should offer audiovisual professionals the prospect of forging long-term working relationships with their third-country counterparts."
"in writing. - I voted against the Costa report on airport slots, in order to highlight the complete lack of consultation with airport authorities, the lack of debate with MEPs and the rushed nature of the legislation."
"This measure will only exacerbate problems in the aviation sector."
"I voted for the Deprez report."
"This regulation establishes a procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries."
"I believe that it is very important to establish a procedure allowing Member States to negotiate international agreements in cases in which the Community has decided not to exercise its competence."
"As an example, at the moment Portugal is prevented from concluding international agreements to speed up judicial cooperation, including on issues relating to parental responsibility, maintenance obligations and divorce, as the Community is considered to have partially acquired exclusive competence over these areas."
"This proposal allows the Commission to authorise the conclusion of such agreements."
"Given the close ties that Portugal has with certain countries, particularly the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, and the high number of Portuguese migrants in various countries, it is very important, in terms of family law, that Portugal be able to speed up recognition of the rights of Portuguese citizens in these countries by concluding or revising bilateral agreements."
"Although I have cited the example of Portugal, I feel it is equally important for all EU citizens that this regulation be negotiated as quickly as possible."
"The European Court of Justice has established that the Community has exclusive power to enter into international agreements with third countries in certain areas."
"Under the same provisions, individual Member States that have previously entered into bilateral agreements with a third country, or that wish to do so in the future, are prevented from doing so because it is not deemed compatible with the EC Treaty."
"In exceptional cases, however, the EU may authorise the Member State to enter into bilateral agreements: if the Community has no interest in agreements with the third country, if the individual Member State has a particular interest in the agreement and the agreement does not negatively impact Community law."
"The June List is in favour of the realisation of the internal market and supports the work on seeking solutions at EU level to the environmental challenges facing Europe."
"In these areas we accept a certain degree of supranationalism."
"However, we are opposed to the supranational legislative measures above."
"Of course individual Member States must be able to enter into bilateral legal agreements with third countries if they judge such agreements to be better for them than those that exist at EU level!"
"While it is undoubtedly good that a small possibility of self-determination is now being proposed through the introduction of a negotiating procedure, it is nonetheless small comfort and does not change the clear - even if not explicitly expressed - aim of creating an EU state."
"I have therefore voted against the report."
"As regards the recent protests against the results of the Moldovan elections, my group has submitted a separate resolution which diverges from the compromise reached by the four groups."
"There is no difference between the two resolutions in relation to our calls for free and fair elections, but they do differ in their assessments of the government and the majority party in Moldova."
"My group has followed the reasoning that the protests have been organised by non-democratic forces which seek to challenge the repeat vote for the Communist party cast by one half of the electorate."
"In addition, it has been assumed that the protests have been organised by Moldova's neighbour, Romania, which wants to annex Moldova."
"In the light of this, the majority of my group will be voting against the joint resolution."
"However, I, personally, will be voting in favour of it."
"There are many Moldovans who have applied for Romanian nationality."
"Our political contacts with the party currently in office in Moldova must not prevent us from respecting the desire of a large section of the Moldovan population for annexation to Romania."
"That desire has been stimulated by the fact that public opinion in a number of Member States does not support further enlargement."
"Annexation to Romania would, then, be the only way that Moldovans could enter the EU."
"Moldova is experiencing great political and economic difficulties."
"The dramatic events of 5, 7 and 8 April on the streets of Chişinău after the elections show that society, and especially young people, wants change and speedy unification with the European Union."
"The communists are blocking essential reforms and are negotiating with Russia, even though officially they support rapprochement with European structures."
"We should help Moldova on this road."
"Greater engagement of the EU will give the government and people of Moldova greater certainty that the EU and the possibility of membership are real."
"The government must introduce fundamental reforms to allow normal political and economic development, reforms which will lead to a market economy, democratisation of civil life and observance of citizens' rights."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the situation in the Republic of Moldova."
"I think that it is extremely important that all the political groups gave their attention and proper support to this subject."
"As a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I support the fact that the European Union continues to give the Republic of Moldova all the support it requires to enable it to fulfil its European destiny, in line with the aspirations of its people."
"It is important for the Republic of Moldova to develop economically and offer its citizens the best possible living conditions and the chance to fulfil their potential."
"I believe that Romania, as a European Union Member State neighbouring the Republic of Moldova, must contribute, under the terms and on the basis of an agreement promoting cooperation, good neighbourliness and mutual respect, to the economic and social development of this country."
"in writing. - One of the positive aspects of the EU is the way in which it seeks to spread values of democracy, human rights and good governance throughout the world by way of its relationships with third countries."
"It is, however, deeply ironic that the EU places so much emphasis on democracy elsewhere while ignoring democracy within the EU itself, as can be seen by the reaction to Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I wish to draw attention to two parts of the world: firstly, Central Asia."
"Although I recognise the strategic importance of this region to the EU, I believe that continued engagement on the EU's part must be matched by advances in human rights and democratisation in Central Asia."
"Secondly, I would like to contrast the human rights situation in the authoritarian Communist dictatorship of China with the vigorous and free democracy of Taiwan."
"Taiwan enjoys an exceptionally high standard of human rights in east Asia and can serve as an example to China of what societies can achieve when they take the bold decision to become truly free."
"in writing. - This report on the Annual Report on Human Rights 2008 evaluates the state of human rights actions around the world and calls for improvements in some key areas."
"Regarding Amendment 2, while I disagree strongly with Pope Benedict's quoted stance on the prophylactic use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, I could not support this amendment because of the gratuitous and inaccurate drafting."
"I voted for the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2008."
"This report essentially has two objectives."
"Firstly, it is intended to supply a documentary reference basis making possible awareness, discussion and evaluation of the year's actions, with the aim of improvement, correction and expansion in respect of future operations."
"Secondly, it is intended to inform the widest possible audience of the EU's actions to promote human rights worldwide."
"I believe it is very important to have a debate aimed at setting priorities, identifying issues which require action at EU level, and maintaining, with periodic evaluation, a list of situations calling for especial vigilance."
"This report also includes the issue of women's rights and shows that there is a gap which must be filled in the development of the EU's specific actions and policies in favour of women's human rights."
"You only have to look at the contents of the resolution on the situation in Palestine to see the extent to which it is an unacceptable exercise in hypocrisy and cynicism by a majority in Parliament with regard to human rights (in the world)."
"The resolution does not have a single word of condemnation for Israel's cruel aggression towards the Palestinian people, which nothing can justify."
"The resolution whitewashes the savagery inflicted on the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip - which the resolution of the UN Human Rights Council denounced and condemned - and does not have a single word of solidarity for the Palestinian people, who are victims of the most brutal violations of human rights, perpetrated by the Israeli Army and by the terrorism of the Israeli state."
"The aspects of the resolution with which we may agree cannot override the fact that this annual initiative by the EP is essentially nothing more than a perfidious exercise in the manipulation of human rights and their unacceptable use as a weapon of interference by the EU's major powers (and their large economic and financial groups) against people who are asserting their sovereignty and rights."
"Once again we say: you can count on us to defend human rights, but do not count on us for exercises in hypocrisy."
"I voted for adoption of the Obiols i Germà report on Human Rights in the World 2008 and the European Union's policy on the matter."
"I voted in favour because the scandalous amendment attacking Pope Benedict XVI had been rejected."
"If the Pope were to be considered a threat to human rights it would mean that the world would be standing on its head."
"I do not understand the authors of that amendment."
"There are, unfortunately, a great many cases of the violation of human rights in the world."
"These demand our engagement, condemnation and action."
"The Catholic Church and many other confessions are our allies in the fight to ensure respect for human dignity."
"Attacking the Pope is only evidence of pre-election cynicism and harmful radicalism."
"It is a pity that at the end of this term some MEPs have become entangled in such an embarrassing affair."
"An independent foreign policy is essential for maintaining national sovereignty."
"Each Member State's foreign relations must be subject to democratic control."
"The EU must not conduct a common foreign policy because such a development risks taking away from people their opportunity to hold their elected politicians accountable for their actions in their relations with foreign countries."
"The present report contains a number of important statements supporting specific aspects of human rights."
"Naturally I have voted in favour of these."
"However, the report as a whole is a means of promoting the EU's positions on foreign policy."
"I have therefore voted against it in the final vote."
"I recognise the importance of the resolution's aim of improving the human rights situation in a number of vulnerable countries."
"I share its ambition to abolish the use of the death penalty and improve the working situation of human rights campaigners and NGOs."
"At the same time, I agree that requirements must be set of human rights in the countries with which the EU cooperates."
"Nonetheless, I cannot vote in favour of the resolution because I strongly oppose the mention of delayed ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which is an insult to the Irish population's rejection of the Treaty."
"Moreover, I am opposed to the aim of having joint structures and personnel for creating actual EU embassies."
"I believe that the EU does not have competence in this area; nor should it have."
"in writing. - I take issue with amendment 2, which criticized the Roman Catholic Church and its leader Pope Benedict for his views on the use of condoms, but wisely the House rejected this amendment."
"There is little evidence that promoting the use of condoms actually prevents the transmission of AIDS."
"Pope Benedict is entitled to his views as his own human right, whether or not others agree with them."
"I wonder whether this report would have dared to criticize a leader of another major world religion in the same hostile way."
"It is the role of the Roman Catholic Church to lead the faithful, not to be led."
"We should accord more respect to a Church and a religion on which the values of our Union are founded."
"British Conservative MEPs support high standards of human rights in the world, but overall abstained on the report in the final vote as it included issues like 'Reproductory Rights' - which effectively mean abortion - and the death sentence, which are individual conscience matters, as well as advocating policy areas like the ICC, and the Lisbon Treaty, which we have a party position opposing."
"in writing. - I am the strongest supporter of genuine human rights and therefore have no difficulty with many aspects of this report."
"I was personally responsible for introducing a paragraph asking the Council and Member States to take more effective action over the human rights catastrophe caused by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe."
"However, the report consistently and unaccountably refers to the EU as if it were a sovereign state - references that I and other Members attempted unsuccessfully to remove at the committee stage."
"The idea that individual Member States should surrender their national prerogative on matters of human rights to the European Union, whether in the forum of the United Nations or elsewhere, is totally unacceptable."
"I also object to the gratuitous and unnecessary references to the Treaty of Lisbon, which Conservatives and many others have consistently opposed."
"I therefore abstained on the final vote on the report."
"Articles 84 and 96 of the report deal with the human rights situation in Cuba."
"It must be said that, despite international pressure, systematic intimidation, interrogation and sophisticated forms of violence have continued against the Women in White even in 2008."
"Several weeks ago the regime attempted in all manner of ways to prevent them from mounting a silent protest on the sixth anniversary of their husbands' imprisonment."
"As a mark of support, a solidarity march for the Women in White and their husbands was held in Bratislava on 28 April 2009."
"Of the 75 activists imprisoned six years ago, whose cause has been backed by organisations including the EU, 54 remain behind bars."
"Only if we monitor their plight will we succeed in getting them out of prison before they are reduced to human wrecks."
"Let us not forget that we will soon be commemorating the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"What we can do for the Cuban prisoners and their wives now is to leave the paragraphs on human rights' violations in Cuba in the text of the report."
"I feel I have to mention Amendment 2, which sharply criticises Pope Benedict XVI."
"This amendment maligns the head of the Catholic Church."
"Besides that, it places his statements on the same level as crimes committed in countries where the death penalty is abused, where people are tortured and killed for expressing their opinions and where there is no respect for the most basic human rights."
"Let us reject this amendment."
"in writing. - UK Conservatives believe that, while cross-border cooperation in criminal justice is important, the report seeks to create a common justice area at an EU level, which would significantly compromise the traditions of those countries which base their legal system on common law."
"Therefore, we cannot support this proposal."
"in writing. - Criminal justice is rightly the responsibility of EU Member States."
"I can accept that Member States need to cooperate in trans-national matters related to criminal justice but I do not accept the development of an EU criminal justice area."
"Extending the EU's so-called 'competence' into criminal justice would be an unwarranted and unacceptable intrusion into British sovereignty."
"People in my region of North-East England want criminal law to be made by accountable British parliamentarians and applied by British judges."
"The fact that the EU is seeking to extend its powers into areas hitherto reserved for Member States exclusively shows the true aim of the EU: to create a federal superstate."
"People in my region do not want to see that occurring."
"They reject the conventional wisdom of ever-closer union and want to see a looser, more flexible system of intergovernmental cooperation."
"I hope the new group in which British Conservatives will sit in the next parliament will be able to deliver what most Britons want from Europe."
"Under the guise of combating mafia organisations and organised crime in general, the Eurocrats of Brussels wish to further impose their federalist views, which destroy nations, peoples and identities."
"Indeed, while everyone knows that each EU Member State has its own laws, legal traditions, and codes, here we have yet another assault by these fanatical Euro-federalists, in the shape of their desire to create a 'European judicial culture'."
"In order to establish this culture, the following should accordingly be created: a European Judicial School, an academy of European law for judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, and all others involved in the administration of justice."
"What about national judicial schools?"
"What about the inextricable differences between the legislations deriving from common law and those from written law?"
"No answer is given, obviously."
"In practice, it will be the entire judicial and penal systems of the Member States that will disappear in the face of this forced harmonisation - downwards harmonisation, that is."
"These sorcerer's apprentices of Europe's have not understood a thing; only the nation states, Europe's main components, will be able to enrich it and to restore it to its rightful place in the world."
"Europe must not be built at the expense of its nations and its peoples."
"Parliament voted today on a report on the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on the development of the institutional balance of the European Union."
"The report proposes that the additional Members which Sweden and other Member States will be given if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force be elected already in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament and then be given the status of observers in Parliament."
"The report also proposes that the appointment of a new President of the Commission be carried out in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This means that the choice of the President should reflect the political majority within the European Parliament and that the choice of candidate should be preceded by discussions between the Council and the political groups within Parliament."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"However, our votes should not in any way be seen as us pre-empting the individual Member States' ratification processes."
"We fully respect each Member State's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted for the report on the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on the development of the institutional balance of the European Union."
"This report looks at the Treaty of Lisbon's impact on the development of the EU's institutional balance."
"It highlights the importance of implementing the new provisions and making the first appointments."
"The possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of 2009 calls for a political agreement between the Council and the European Parliament in order to ensure that the procedure for the choice of the next President of the Commission and for the nomination of the future Commission will, in any case, respect the substance of the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon assigns to the European Parliament on this issue."
"As a result, the report sets out a series of recommendations aimed at developing an institutional balance and stresses that the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens each of the European institutions in its area of competence."
"This resolution forms part of a package of five resolutions, adopted today by the majority in Parliament, which shows the clearest possible contempt for the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, who rejected the European Constitution and its twin brother, the so-called Treaty of Lisbon, in referendums."
"It is also one of the many initiatives aiming to impose this unacceptable draft Treaty."
"Instead of burying the Lisbon Treaty once and for all, the EP is again adopting a resolution which glorifies the anti-democratic institutional balance of the European Union proposed in the resolution, concealing the fact that, among many other examples, this:"
"transfers sovereign powers from the Portuguese people to the EU's supranational institutions, dominated by the major powers, an example of which is the management of the marine biological resources in our Exclusive Economic Zone;"
"extends the application of the majority rule in decision-making, which will reinforce the domination of the major powers and prevent Portugal from vetoing decisions that go against the national interest;"
"increases the removal of authority from the national democratic institutions (the only ones which directly result from the democratic will of the people), an example of which is the transfer of powers from the national parliaments, which are losing the power to make decisions in fundamental areas and which are becoming a kind of advisory body without the right to veto Community decisions that go against national interests."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected in the referendum in Ireland."
"Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses."
"This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU."
"It is worth noting that in paragraph 4 of Mr Dehaene's report it is stated (quote): 'Welcomes the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon stipulates that the European Council may by unanimity, and with the consent of the European Parliament, provided there is no opposition by a national parliament, extend qualified majority decision-making and the ordinary legislative procedure to areas in which they do not yet apply'."
"Notwithstanding the fact that voters in many Member States are clearly sceptical of an increasingly supranational Union, the federalist majority in the European Parliament indicates the possibility of making the Union even more supranational under the Treaty of Lisbon and shifting even more power to the EU without having to agree on a new treaty."
"I have voted against the report."
"Parliament voted today on a report on the development of the relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This report welcomes the new powers that will be given to the national parliaments by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It also investigates the possibilities for future development of the relations between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"However, our votes should not in any way be seen as us pre-empting the individual Member States' ratification processes."
"We fully respect each Member State's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted for Mr Brok's report."
"This report welcomes the new powers given to the national parliaments by the Treaty of Lisbon and examines the possibilities of future cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Czech Republic represents an important step towards its rapid entry into force."
"This report shows how important this new Treaty of the European Union is."
"We voted against this report firstly because it lacks a purpose: the Treaty of Lisbon does not exist; it was rejected by three referendums."
"We voted against it secondly because it recommends subordinating the national parliaments to the European Parliament: the latter, secure in the strength of its superiority and, no doubt, its unbearable arrogance, would provide its support to the national parliaments - made up in its eyes, no doubt, of philistines and idiots - to examine European texts."
"Is this support or pressure?"
"It would invite itself to the plenary sessions of national parliaments; it would play the role of adviser; it would influence the way in which parliaments transpose texts in order to encourage uniformity; it would assert itself to make sure that defence budgets are debated ... would it also dictate to them the way in which they should control governments and their activities within the Council?"
"Lastly, we voted against it because it is based on a double hypocrisy: the national parliaments have obtained nothing other than a very difficult to implement and hence ineffective right to monitor respect for the principle of subsidiarity; this principle is an illusion since many supposedly exclusive EU competences are sanctuarised, and the definition of subsidiarity as provided by the Treaties in fact promotes Brussels's powers."
"This resolution forms part of a package of five resolutions, adopted today by the majority in Parliament, which shows the clearest possible contempt for the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, who rejected the European Constitution and its twin brother, the so-called Treaty of Lisbon, in referendums."
"It is also one of the many initiatives aiming to impose this unacceptable draft Treaty."
"This resolution on the 'development of the relations between the European Parliament and national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon' is a prime example of deceit."
"The EP welcomes the 'obligations and rights of the national parliaments under the Treaty of Lisbon ... which enhance their role in the political processes of the European Union'."
"It would be a laughing matter if it were not so serious."
"The EP is hiding the fact that, with regard to the supposed enhancement of the role of the national parliaments in the decision-making process, what is actually happening with the Treaty of Lisbon is that these parliaments are losing much more than they are (falsely) gaining, bearing in mind the extensive transfer of powers to the institutions of the European Union."
"Even the (pseudo-)scrutiny of respect for the principle of subsidiarity (over the exercise by the Community institutions of powers transferred in the meantime to the EU by the national parliaments) does not give any of the national parliaments the right of veto."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected by the referendum in Ireland."
"Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses."
"This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU."
"Mr Brok's report praises the Convention that produced a draft Constitutional Treaty."
"This Convention has been heavily criticised for having been entirely undemocratic and controlled from the top by its chairman Giscard d'Estaing."
"In my opinion, Mr Brok's report should have come to the conclusion that, for as long as the political debates of representative democracy are focused on the elections to the national parliaments, it should be the national parliaments that are the highest decision-making bodies within the Union - not the European Parliament."
"I have voted against the report."
"Parliament voted today on a report requesting the Commission to submit a proposal for a regulation on the citizens' initiative as soon as the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified."
"The citizens' initiative will mean that one million citizens coming from a significant number of Member States will be able to take the initiative to request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal."
"This will give citizens the same right as the Council to request the Commission to initiate legislative proposals."
"We have chosen to vote in favour of this report because the European Parliament needs to prepare itself to be able to implement the changes that will occur in connection with its work if the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force."
"However, our votes should not in any way be seen as us pre-empting the individual Member States' ratification processes."
"We fully respect each Member State's right to decide for itself whether to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - I and my Labour delegation colleagues support the introduction of the Citizens' Initiative in the event of the successful ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It would strengthen citizens' rights of participation in the European political process and be additional to the valuable existing right to petition the Parliament."
"However, I am concerned that Mrs Kaufman's proposals would lead to the citizens' initiative process becoming bogged down or hampered by onerous bureaucratic requirements (like Member States having to check every signature and pre-certification by the Commission that it is legal)."
"To encourage more participation, we should follow the spirit of the Citizens' Initiative - namely that it should be as accessible and easy to use as possible."
"Therefore, we had no alternative but to abstain on this report."
"I voted for the report on the implementation of the citizens' initiative."
"The Treaty of Lisbon introduces the European Citizens' Initiative or, in other words, the right of citizens to take part in the European legislative process."
"This is a completely new instrument which strengthens democracy and the rights of citizens."
"It is undoubtedly a way of bringing European citizens closer to the European institutions and raising their awareness of and increasing their participation in the decision-making process."
"The Kaufmann report aims to direct the way in which we implement a 'citizens' initiative', as defined in Article 11 of the abortive Treaty on European Union: 'citizens of the Union numbering not less than one million who are nationals of a significant number of Member States may take the initiative of inviting the Commission, within the framework of its powers, to submit any appropriate proposal on matters where citizens consider that a legal act of the Union is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties'."
"The report therefore lays down precise conditions of admissibility and concrete procedures that make the process of achieving such an initiative extremely difficult."
"I should like to put the citizens on their guard here."
"This new 'right' is an illusion."
"It provides for only one thing: the possibility of asking the Commission to enact new European laws, but not to repeal or to change those that already exist; not to change the policies."
"And, in any case, there is absolutely no obligation for the Commission to listen to them."
"If the Eurocrats are so keen to give rights to European citizens, they should start by respecting their vote and by finally realising that 'No' means 'No' in French, Dutch, English, Gaelic and every other language."
"This resolution forms part of a package of five resolutions, adopted today by the majority in Parliament, which shows the clearest possible contempt for the democratically and sovereignly expressed will of the French, Dutch and Irish peoples."
"It is also one of the many initiatives aiming to impose the unacceptable draft Treaty of Lisbon."
"This resolution is characterised by its absurdity and its hypocrisy."
"The EP may well rhetorically extol the 'smooth, transparent and effective exercise of the right of participation of the citizens' and the so-called 'citizens' initiative' introduced in the draft Treaty, now known as the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The truth is that the forces guiding and promoting this European integration and this Treaty of Lisbon have done and are doing everything they can to prevent the people from debating and understanding the content of this draft Treaty and from being consulted through a referendum."
"What is more, following the Irish rejection of this federalist, neoliberal and militaristic draft Treaty, they are doing everything they can to force another referendum to be held in that country (as many times as necessary until the Irish people say 'yes')."
"In other words, they are preventing the people from expressing their democratic and sovereign will through a referendum and then, with honeyed words, they are throwing up a smokescreen by extolling a so-called 'citizens' initiative', which, on the face of it, will right from the start be subject to many conditions."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which is 96 per cent identical to the draft Constitutional Treaty, was rejected by the referendum in Ireland."
"Prior to that, the draft Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"The majority in this Parliament refuses to acknowledge its political losses."
"This is an outrageous crime against democratic principles and an equally outrageous example of the arrogance of power that characterises cooperation in the EU."
"Mrs Kaufmann's report counts its chickens before they are hatched."
"It shows an exceptional arrogance towards democracy, and above all towards the Irish population, which is once again to be forced into a referendum because - in the view of the political establishment - they gave the 'wrong' answer last time."
"In this situation there is no point in discussing this report in the European Parliament."
"The proposed citizens' initiative is in itself an extremely unclear proposal for citizens' influence in respect of elected politicians."
"The latter can choose to disregard these initiatives entirely if it suits them."
"I have voted against the report."
"Although this is a good resolution, I have voted against it because the European Parliament has agreed, in the resolution, to the Commission exempting certain electrolysis installations from the asbestos ban."
"I think that, if you say that there is an absolute ban on asbestos in Europe, you have to be consistent with that and allow no exemptions."
"We still have people who are critically ill because of exposure to asbestos, and I find it incomprehensible that the Commission has failed to take that into account."
"I have therefore voted against the resolution out of solidarity with the victims of asbestos."

"1."
"Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi."
"author. - Madam President, Iran is notorious for its human rights record, as was noted just yesterday during the debate on the human rights situation in the world."
"Today we are addressing the case of Roxana Saberi, a journalist who had her trial just three weeks ago and was condemned to eight years in prison for so-called espionage."
"The fact is that Ms Saberi has had no access to her lawyer for more than a month."
"There was no chance of a fair or transparent trial, because the trial was held in camera."
"She was on hunger strike for at least two weeks."
"It is true that she has ended this, but her health is in a very precarious state."
"Therefore, we are here today to address a message to the Iranian authorities that we clearly condemn the sentence pronounced by the Iranian Revolutionary Court on 18 April 2009 and ask that Ms Saberi be immediately and unconditionally freed on the basis that the trial was held in camera, without legal process."
"I would like to add that Iran is notorious for its massive, systematic public executions, whether by stoning or by hanging, including of juvenile offenders."
"That, too, is part of our message."
"Two and a half minutes, Madam President."
"Over the last five years, we have had many debates on Iran."
"My group had sympathy for the revolution at the end of the 1970s, not because of any affinity with the religious extremists of the time, but because the previous government, led by the Pahlevi family, did not represent the people."
"That government was only able to survive because of its close links to the United States and Europe."
"Because the previous government to that, which had been led by Prime Minister Mossadeq and which had enjoyed more popular support, had been removed as a result of foreign pressure, the huge swathe of the population which was opposed to the government acquired an extreme anti-Western attitude."
"The West was not seen as an ally in the fight for democracy and progress, but as a colonial profiteer and oppressor."
"Nowadays, there is no longer any doubt that power has fallen into the hands of groups which not only seek conflict with the United States and Israel, but are also extremely conservative, intolerant and undemocratic."
"They oppress their own citizens, they have brought the judiciary and the army under the firm grip of religious fanatics and they are preventing the electorate from voting for people who hold more moderate views."
"The rights of women and the rights of ethnic and religious minorities have been shoved to one side and the death penalty is often carried out in public, in the cruellest of manners, as a means of suppressing non-conformist behaviour."
"Moreover, opposition activities within Iran can result in detention."
"Members of the opposition who have fled abroad are being persecuted and discredited by the governments, media and public opinion of the countries where they now live."
"This can be seen from their attempts to place the opposition in exile on a list of terrorist organisations, as well as their attempts to close the Ashraf refugee camp in Iraq."
"Quite rightly, this Parliament has recently spoken out against these two practices."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, the first of May, which is a day of celebration for us in the West, unfortunately continues to be a day of struggle in Iran."
"This year it was marked not only by the usual brutal repression of demonstrations by Iranian workers, but also by the execution of a young woman aged 17, Delara Darabi, who was convicted of a crime, despite everything pointing to the fact that she did not commit this crime."
"According to Amnesty International, on the day before her execution, this young woman had told her mother of her plans for the future, in the expectation that the huge campaign for her release would be successful."
"Delara Darabi is yet another martyr of religious fanaticism, like so many others whose execution we have denounced in this House."
"Human rights organisations have also this week confirmed the information, published on 1 May by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, about the stoning in Lakan prison of a man accused of adultery, and announced the imminent stoning of another man in the province of Gilan, once again belying the supposed Iranian moratorium on this barbaric practice."
"As reported by the movement which fights for the abolition of the death penalty, Tire as Mãos de Caim, Iran is the country with the highest number of executions per capita in the world."
"Just this morning, four people were executed in Evin prison, with another eight having been executed in Taibad prison on 2 May."
"The imprisonment of nationals of third countries, such as the American, Roxana Saberi, is also a routine practice in order to blackmail other countries into granting diplomatic concessions."
"In this regard, the comment made by the Secretary of Tire as Mãos de Caim, Sergio D'Elia, is extremely pertinent and highlights the most important point: the brutality of the Mullahs' regime is not only the responsibility of the Iranian fundamentalist regime."
"European governments are consenting to this through their silence, tolerance and constant desire to appease, and they are succumbing to the Iranian political and commercial blackmail."
"The Tehran regime is threatening the peace and security of the whole world and, even more clearly, of its own citizens, through acts which have been practised for decades."
"Instead of taking this into account, Europe is making Iran the solution to the problems of the Middle East, when it is actually the main problem."
"On this final occasion that I will speak before the European Parliament, I call on those who will be here at the next sitting not to abandon the Iranians to their jailers and not to abandon the people of the Middle East to the abyss of religious fanaticism."
"author. - Madam President, I will not repeat what was said already regarding the ruthless Iranian theocratic regime."
"I agree with those positions, but I want to approach the subject from an angle similar to that used by my fellow MEP, Mr Mayer, who has just left."
"Iran, a country with thousands of years of civilisation and culture, is today in a sorry state of affairs as far as democracy, civil rights and justice are concerned."
"Some of our countries in the West are not free from blame for this situation."
"Let us not forget that governments such as those of the USA and Britain have for years supported, armed and kept in power the well-known monstrous dictatorship of the Shah of Iran."
"It was inevitable that, when the Shah was finally overthrown by popular uprising, Islamic extremists would find fertile ground to root themselves in power and cultivate feelings of hate towards the West."
"Then came the excessively aggressive behaviour of successive US administrations and the position of drastic sanctions, which only caused further suffering to ordinary Iranian people and further aggravated their hostile feelings towards the West."
"Hopefully the new President of the USA, Mr Obama, who has shown signs that he prefers to fight with his brain rather than with his fists, as the previous President, Mr Bush, so unsuccessfully did, will give new hope for the improvement of the likes of the Iranian people and the betterment of relations with the West."
"Such an approach will help ordinary Iranian citizens understand that the West wants to be their friend, not their enemy, and eventually the people of Iran will themselves overthrow the Islamic fundamentalist regime that so undemocratically controls their lives and causes them so much suffering, as in the case at the centre of our debate here today."
"Madam President, Roxana Saberi is a 32-year-old journalist with dual American and Iranian citizenship, and is a graduate of several universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Iran."
"She was working as a journalist in Iran and continued to do so following the expiry of her accreditation, and was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison on a false charge of spying for the United States."
"In protest at the false charges and the lack of a fair trial she went on hunger strike."
"She is very emaciated."
"She began to drink sweetened water under medical care and has now ended her hunger strike, and is waiting for her appeal to be heard."
"Her health and her life are still in danger."
"Iran is well known for its draconian punishments, and also for carrying out public executions, including on juveniles."
"We call for the release of Mrs Saberi."
"We appeal for her to be given a fair trial."
"I think that the international community should put pressure on Iran to end these draconian practices."
"We are talking about Roxana Saberi, an American-Iranian journalist who worked for ABC Radio, the BBC and South African television."
"Accused of spying, sentenced to eight years and imprisoned, she went on hunger strike."
"On 1 May, very weak, she was transferred to the prison hospital."
"We know that for five weeks she was denied access to a lawyer."
"Her trial was neither fair nor transparent."
"Yesterday the BBC announced that next week, on 12 May, the Appeal Court will hear Roxana Saberi's appeal, but that this would again take place in a closed-door session."
"We condemn the Iranian Revolutionary Court's unfounded decision on Roxana Saberi."
"In addition, I think it is very important to once again urge Iranian Government institutions to comply with the provisions of all international human rights instruments ratified by Iran, in particular, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which both guarantee the right to a fair trial."
"On the last day of this legislative term, such a beautiful spring day, it would be nice to hope that somehow this subject, human rights violations, will one day no longer be on Parliament's agenda, that we will no longer have to discuss it in this beautiful Chamber."
"However, sadly, this is just an illusion and today, as always, our agenda is overloaded and does not even contain all of the painful cases from various countries around the world."
"This is not the first time we have discussed Iran in this plenary session."
"This time we are concerned about the unlawful imprisonment of Roxana Saberi."
"She was first arrested for an apparently minor offence - purchasing wine - although in Iran it is an offence."
"Then, however, there was the charge that she was working as a journalist without official accreditation, which later turned into the charge that she was a US spy."
"The Iranian Government organised a one-day closed-door trial without witnesses or concrete, publicly declared charges."
"This is not the first time the Iranian Government has trampled on human rights, imprisoned people unlawfully and passed verdicts which contravene international standards."
"The execution of Delara Darabi, the detention of the journalist Maryam Malek and defenders of workers' rights - these are but a few examples."
"We must recognise that Iranian fundamentalists continue to organise political trials in an attempt to further intimidate free thinkers."
"It is regrettable that Iran is continuing its policy of self-isolation in this way and is failing to exploit initiatives by the international community and the new US Administration to normalise relations."
"I have always said that dialogue and mutual understanding are better than confrontation, but this time I propose that we react in a very strict, hard manner to this case and that we demand that the Iranian regime's court respect all international standards."
"Madam President, the jailing of the journalist Roxana Saberi on trumped-up spying charges is shameful and another appalling crime in the long list of criminal abuse by the fascist regime in Tehran."
"Last Friday, as Paulo Casaca told us, their executioners took a 23-year-old girl from her cell and led her to the gallows without first allowing her access to her parents."
"They hanged Dilara Darabi for a crime she denied committing at the age of 17."
"This is what passes for justice in Iran."
"The medieval torture and execution of women - even pregnant women - and children is commonplace."
"The abuse of human rights is a daily fact of life, and yet we have people in this Parliament who support this corrupt and evil regime: just like those European companies which continue to do business with Iran, their eyes and ears are closed to the screams of the oppressed."
"Shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs."
"They should remember the lessons of history: every fascist regime is doomed to fail; freedom and justice will always prevail over evil."
"(NL) Madam President, my original speaking time was unfairly cut short as it approached the two-and-a-half-minute limit, but the conclusion of my argument was that you cannot create change through foreign interventions or other forms of military violence."
"It was exactly that kind of approach in the past which led to the birth of the current regime."
"If you threaten Iran with foreign interventions, many people in Iran who hate the current government will actually rush to the government's support in order to defend their fatherland."
"However, we must not go to the other extreme, either."
"It is wrong to seek cooperation with this regime in the belief that the current grouping will remain in power permanently or that supporting stability in this country will benefit the European energy supply."
"Consistently standing up for human rights and lending support to the democratic opposition are the only ways to bring about improvement."
"That will also include the kind of improvement which will benefit the victim who has been the subject of this debate."
"Madam President, I wish to support my colleague - even though he is Scottish - Struan Stevenson."
"Persia, as we all know, was one of the great civilisations of our continent and this world."
"There are many Iranians who are decent and good people."
"Struan spoke from the heart, and he is right."
"No man kills women and children and lives to boast of it."
"What are we going to do?"
"We are merely Members of the European Parliament."
"We can merely shout in rage against this form of brutality, this form of inhumanity."
"My only conclusion is that we should support those democratic, civilised Iranians and work with them to secure a decent, humanitarian, civilised government for the good people of Iran and let the murderers be condemned."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is following closely the case of Ms Roxana Saberi, including the preparations for the appeal process that will begin early next week."
"The Commission is concerned about Ms Saberi's health, weakened by a hunger strike that, according to Ms Saberi's father, she started after she was sentenced to eight years in jail for alleged espionage by the Revolutionary Court of Tehran last month."
"The Commission considers that Ms Saberi's trial, held behind closed doors, did not meet the minimum standards required for a fair and transparent trial."
"The Commission fully supported the declaration issued by the Czech Presidency of the Council on Ms Saberi's case on 22 April 2009."
"We hope that the Iranian judiciary will ensure a fair and transparent appeal trial without any delay, with all the guarantees provided by the Iranian legislation."
"The Commission is deeply concerned at the steady deterioration of the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran."
"The recent execution of Ms Delara Darabi, hanged on 1 May for a crime she allegedly committed when she was a minor, is another confirmation of this dismal situation."
"Also in this case the EU issued a statement strongly condemning the execution."
"The Commission has repeatedly urged, and will continue to do so, the Iranian authorities to respect their international commitments on human rights, including in relation to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights."
"The improvement of the human rights situation in Iran is, for the Commission, essential to enhance its political dialogue and cooperation with Iran in the near future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The sentencing of Roxana Saberi on 18 April 2009 for 'spying' was done without her having any access to a lawyer and on the basis of a trial that was neither fair nor transparent."
"I am not naive."
"The US does engage in spying but, if Roxana Saberi was a spy, the Iranian authorities by their actions did nothing to convince anyone of that case."
"The bias and manipulation of the trial and the accused were a travesty of any sense of justice."
"I can only welcome the resolution's demand that Roxana Saberi should be released immediately on the grounds that the trial was held in camera without due legal process and there was a complete failure to comply with international norms."
"2."
"Madagascar"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Madagascar."
"Madam President, as can be seen from the resolution itself, after two months of violent clashes, Andry Rajoelina, former mayor of the capital of Madagascar, staged a coup d'état on 17 March of this year; he was supported by the army and a self-proclaimed 'High Authority of Transition', over which he presides, and he suspended the national assembly and the senate."
"Furthermore, pressure from rebels forced the democratically elected president to leave Madagascar."
"However, last February Mr Rajoelina, who had been elected mayor of Antananarivo in December 2007, had, in turn, been forcibly removed from power by the previous government."
"I should add that the malaise felt by the population was exacerbated by the former government's plan to rent one million hectares of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm."
"Of course, we also condemn the coup d'état and any attempt to seize power by undemocratic means."
"We also believe that the United Nations Security Council and international organisations of which Madagascar is a member do not recognise this de facto regime and we want constitutional order to be restored."
"We ask, too, that legal and constitutional systems be immediately re-established in the country and we call on all Malagasy parties to fully comply with the provisions of the constitution of Madagascar in order to overcome this crisis."
"However, we also consider that democracy does not simply consist in holding elections and we should report major irregularities in the - a priori - legitimate government of Madagascar."
"Nevertheless, we are convinced that when constitutional order is restored it should be based on the objectives and principles that already appear in Recital K of this resolution, that is: a clear timetable for free, fair and transparent elections; the participation of all political groups and social stakeholders in the country, including the legitimate President Marc Ravalomanana and other key figures; thirdly, the promotion of a consensus between Malagasy parties; fourthly, respect for the constitution of Madagascar; and lastly, compliance with the relevant African Union instruments and Madagascar's international commitments."
"What is clear is that we are once again facing a situation in which human rights are systematically breached."
"While the leading classes of Madagascar engage in a power struggle through coup d'états and fight over important, lucrative business contracts, 70% of the population is living on less than one dollar a day."
"That, and that alone, is what we need to resolve."
"Let us hope, then, that the European Union assumes its proper role in this matter."
"Madam President, changing the subject completely and taking advantage of the fact that Commissioner Orban is present in the last session of this term, I would like to thank him personally for his management of his Directorate-General."
"Madam President, Bavaria and its municipalities have many contacts all over the world, as does the Catholic University of Eichstätt."
"I should therefore like to welcome a delegation of mayors from this region."
"Madagascar is a country with which we work closely and intensively. There are many cultural, economic and scientific contacts and a strong and supportive ecclesiastical presence."
"That is why it is all the more regrettable that, in this scenically beautiful and culturally rich country, such appalling abuses are being committed."
"There is a real danger that Madagascar, in its strategically important location, will become a failed state, like others we know of in Africa, first and foremost of which is Somalia."
"It is therefore important that orderly and democratic relations are restored there as quickly as possible."
"That is why I am pleased that we met the contact group a few days ago to discuss first concrete steps."
"We must create an appropriate structure to prepare for new elections under the leadership of the ousted democratically elected president, whom we continue to recognise as the only legitimate head of state."
"A dialogue must be opened, which must include the prime minister, who is currently in prison and who must be released immediately."
"Not only humanitarian aid but also vital development aid, especially medical care, must continue to be given to the fullest extent."
"For all these reasons, we in the European Union are called upon to be involved in the negotiations there, not only as a humanitarian factor and not only as an economic factor, but especially as a political factor bringing about peace in the region."
"To achieve this, we count on the cooperation of the African Union, which once again has the opportunity to establish itself little by little as a factor in democratic stabilisation - stabilisation can in fact also be anti-democratic - which we will intensively support with the means at our disposal."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, in Madagascar, the incumbent president was forced to step down by popular protest."
"He came to agreements with foreign companies that brought short-term revenue to his government but were detrimental to his people."
"That made his position untenable."
"Afterwards, with the help of the army, the leader of the opposition, who had previously been the capital's mayor, was appointed interim president, despite the fact that, by law, he was too young to be appointed to that office."
"This process, in particular the intervention of the army, has led to criticism."
"The African Union has called this an illegal coup and rejects the new government."
"However, I think that we could also draw a comparison between this and recent events in one particular European country, Iceland."
"In that country, too, the government had to step down in the face of popular protest."
"A minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power, but nobody considered that a coup."
"Since then, a new election has been held and the new government has secured a large majority."
"Such an outcome is also possible in Madagascar, provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future."
"author. - Madam President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group and as the Party of European Socialists' shadow rapporteur on the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the group of southern African countries that included Madagascar."
"In April we overwhelmingly approved that Economic Partnership Agreement with reservations about the situation in Zimbabwe."
"If we were debating that EPA today, we would have to enter our reservations regarding Madagascar."
"Yet only 15 years ago there seems to have been the potential for Madagascar to be so different."
"I can remember in 1993 the visit of the then newly elected President Albert Zafy."
"But, of course, by 1996 he had been impeached for corruption and the abuse of power."
"Since then, Madagascar has been troubled by unstable governments with threats of secession and impeachment punctuating a rough politics."
"Now we have a situation - an army coup d'état - partly triggered by a plan by the former government to lease one million acres of land in the south of the country to a Korean firm for intensive farming, when a substantial majority of the population live on less than one euro a day."
"This unconstitutional change of government is a serious setback for democratisation."
"We welcome the fact that the UN has appealed for nearly USD 36 million worth of humanitarian aid, anticipating the food shortages that will result later this year from the current political events in Madagascar, but we strongly condemn the coup d'état and all attempts to seize power by undemocratic means."
"We call for the immediate restoration of the legal and constitutional order in the country and ask all Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the constitution."
"We want to see the suspension of the National Assembly and Senate lifted and urge that the mandates and immunities of parliamentarians be respected."
"But this is only going to happen if the international community can work together to step up its efforts and exercise pressure to end the political violence and the political impasse in that country."
"Madam President, we cannot keep silent regarding the situation in Madagascar and we shall not be the only ones to condemn it."
"The African Union, the Southern African Development Community, the International Organisation of French-Speaking Countries, the Interparliamentary Union, the European Union, speaking via the Commission, the United States, and a large number of countries, including my own and Norway - to speak of countries from the European continent - have condemned the coup d'état - for that is what it is - which has taken place in Madagascar."
"We cannot keep silent and we are calling for a return to constitutional order."
"We are simply asking for a 'back-to-basics' approach with, where necessary, arbitration by the Malagasy people through consultation in the form of a presidential election or a referendum."
"It is the responsibility of the assemblies and the politicians of Madagascar to decide on the most effective form of consultation."
"Thus, what we are calling for with this joint motion for a resolution is to add our voice to that of the international community in order to make it clear to those who have seized power in a totally undemocratic fashion, in the form of a coup d'état - as disguised as it may be - that Madagascar's constitutional order must be restored, as one of the guarantees of the future development of this large island in the Indian Ocean."
"Madam President, the political crisis in Madagascar has led to an unconstitutional change of government. This was accompanied by unrest, in which over 130 people lost their lives."
"Madagascar was under French rule until 1960."
"It is a country in a difficult situation."
"It is in need of humanitarian aid, and especially food aid, and this help has been given to Madagascar."
"The authorities and successive elections which they organised were supported by the army."
"President Ravalomanana lost support, and he stood down on 17 March 2009."
"Power was seized by Rajoelina, who was designated by the army."
"The European Union does not recognise the new government because of the undemocratic way in which this change was made."
"The African Union has suspended Madagascar from membership, and is critical of the removal of Ravalomanana by force."
"It has threatened to impose sanctions if constitutional order is not restored within six months."
"We call for restoration of constitutional order in Madagascar."
"We appeal to the international community to support efforts to restore the legal basis of the function of this state."
"I think that the electoral process should be closely monitored and observed by representatives of international organisations, including in particular Members of our Parliament."
"Madam President, in the first weeks of March we were witnesses of a dramatic coup d'état in Madagascar."
"The rivalry, which has existed for several years, between the deposed president and the leader of the opposition led the island to the brink of civil war."
"On 17 March 2009, the day following capture of the Presidential Palace by the army, Andry Rajoelina declared himself head of state."
"The Malagasy Supreme Court stated that the former Mayor of Antananarivo holds this office in accordance with the Constitution."
"Doubts have been raised about this, if only because there is a clause in the organic statute which says that to be president a person must be at least 40 years of age, and the new president is only 34."
"The assumption of power and the decision of the Supreme Court have aroused universal controversy."
"The swearing-in ceremony was boycotted by most foreign diplomats, and the African Union has suspended Madagascar from membership."
"The political crisis has led to general chaos and destabilisation in the country, where most people have lived for years in terrible poverty on USD 1 a day, and have limited access to food and water, basic medical services and education."
"I lived in Madagascar for six years, and I became thoroughly acquainted with these problems, and therefore I very strongly support the UN appeal for urgent humanitarian aid for the people of Madagascar."
"The European Parliament should strongly condemn the coup d'état and all attempts at taking power which break democratic principles."
"The European Union should call for a renewal of the work of both houses of parliament, which have been suspended by the new regime."
"We should also support the efforts of the special envoy of the African Union and representatives of the UN in their talks with representatives of local political parties and all interested groups in order to bring about an immediate restoration of constitutional order in the country, and the international community should decidedly increase its efforts at bringing humanitarian aid to the people of the island, who are living on the brink of poverty."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Madagascar, which is a former French colony, seems to be undergoing the sad - but not unusual - post-colonial turmoil in its political life, with the consequent suffering for its people."
"Many other colonies of European countries have suffered - or are still suffering - for the same reason."
"There are many examples."
"My own country, Cyprus, is one."
"Having partly gained independence from its colonial master, Britain, in 1960, British foreign diplomacy hawks managed in 1963 to manipulate an inter-community struggle which eventually resulted in the division of the island in 1974."
"This is a division that persists today and a state of affairs which suits Britain."
"A divided Cyprus cannot successfully attempt to get rid of the remaining two British colonial areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which Britain uses for military purposes, and which the British Government has in fact managed to disgracefully keep outside the EU so that the acquis cannot be applied to the thousands of Cypriot civilians - now EU citizens - who live there."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, firstly I would like to underline the Commission's great concern at the current volatile situation in Madagascar."
"I would also like to stress the Commission's continued commitment to the Malagasy people."
"The situation in that country after the forced removal of President Ravalomanana on 17 March deserves and requires our full attention and, like the European Parliament, the Commission is following events very closely."
"The Commission has fully endorsed the Czech Presidency statement issued on behalf of the European Union on 20 March condemning the transfer of power and calling on the Malagasy parties to comply fully with the provisions of the Constitution of Madagascar."
"The Commission considers that there has been a flagrant violation of essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and that this is a 'case of special urgency' within the meaning of Article 96 of that Agreement."
"The Commission has therefore launched the procedure to propose to the Council to open consultation with the authorities in power in order to examine possible solutions to the crisis, aimed at the re-establishment of constitutional order."
"The Commission will continue to use all the dialogue means it has at its disposal to find an overall solution to the current crisis."
"To that end, it is enhancing the political dialogue, based on Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, with all the relevant stakeholders in Madagascar."
"It is also participating in the main international efforts deployed, notably in the framework of the international contact group set up recently by the African Union."
"At this stage, the prevailing view is that the relevant Malagasy political stakeholders agree on a road map for a return to constitutional order and the holding of elections."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales"
"The next item is the debate on three motions for resolutions on Venezuela."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have signed this resolution and asked to speak in this plenary because I was a witness to the so-called 'expulsion' of our colleague Luis Herrero, which was, in fact, a kidnapping."
"What is more, I had a chance to see how political persecution, abuses of power by the Chávez regime, intimidation of the opposition, threats, disregard for human dignity and the misuse of justice are all a normal part of life in Venezuela."
"The case of Manuel Rosales was the last straw and the catalyst for this resolution, but there are thousands of cases just as bloody as his; some of them are quoted in the resolution and others are not, like the case of Eligio Cedeño who was born in the poor Caracas suburb of Petare, a notoriously dangerous area well known for electing a mayor who was not from the Chávez regime."
"Eligio was educated with the help of others, in particular, from Citibank; he managed to set up his own business, the Bank of Caracas, and then lived a normal life, also providing help to the most needy."
"Today, however, he is illegally imprisoned in a Caracas jail following two years of detention with no coherent case being made against him."
"His only crime was to be a part of the economic oligarchy."
"Another case is that of Nixon Moreno, a student leader at the University of the Andes, elected to the university council several times and president of the Federation of University Centres."
"In 2003 he won the Federation election against the current Minister of Interior and Justice, and that is his crime."
"Today he is accused of attempted murder and lewd violent acts, despite having been exonerated of the accusations."
"Cases such as these are a feature of everyday life in Venezuela, where persecution of the opposition with the aim of excluding them from political life and of suppressing dissidents has become part of normal life."
"Nevertheless, we need to send a message of hope to Venezuelan democracy: despite the challenges, I am sure democracy will be established and President Chávez will be voted out."
"author. - Madam President, the case of Manuel Rosales is another example of the arrogance and paranoid behaviour sometimes exhibited by the increasingly more authoritarian Government of Venezuela."
"The political persecution of Mr Rosales and many others is regrettable and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms."
"We will call on the Government of that country in earnest to start behaving sensibly and democratically and to stop violating the human rights of its citizens."
"Madam President, since this is the last time I will be making a speech in the plenary, permit me to take the opportunity to thank you and all our colleagues who have faithfully attended the Thursday afternoon human rights debates and have contributed towards making our world a better place to live in."
"Let me also take the opportunity, as I have so often done in the past, to remind my colleagues of the plight of my own country, Cyprus, which for the past 35 years has been suffering under the military occupation of its northern part by Turkey."
"The citizens - EU citizens - of areas such as Kyrenia, Famagusta, Karpasia and Morfou have been living in exile since the devastating Turkish invasion of 1974."
"We are looking towards the EU for the fulfilment of their humble wish to return to their homes and live there in peace and security."
"I hope the EU will not let them down."
"Madam President, when political changes point to restrictions on the rights of the opposition to free public expression, we should be on our guard."
"It is a strong signal that democracy is under threat."
"Arresting the opposition is an even stronger signal."
"That is what is happening today in Venezuela."
"Manuel Rosales, Mayor of Maracaibo and opponent of President Chávez in the 2006 election, has had to flee the country."
"Shortly after President Chávez won a referendum making it possible for him to hold office for further terms, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Mr Rosales."
"He managed to escape to Peru, where he is in hiding."
"This matter should be the subject of the next sitting of EuroLat."
"Venezuela is obliged to respect conventions which it has signed in which it guaranteed to respect human rights."
"Madam President, 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan-European picnic on the Austro-Hungarian border."
"I had the honour of being allowed to take part in the relevant preparations and I will never forget, a short time later, the Chancellor of Unity, Helmut Kohl, and Pope John Paul II, two spearheads of this development, striding through the Brandenburg Gates and saying that socialism should not be replaced by predatory capitalism but by freedom and a social market economy."
"Today, we are witnessing in Latin America a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression."
"The germ from which this comes is, I am afraid to say, Venezuela."
"President Chávez is attempting to stifle freedom throughout Latin America by means of oil money."
"That is why the case of Manuel Rosales is so important."
"Mr Rosales is not only an outstanding democrat, whom we must defend; he is also a symbolic figure for democracy in Latin America."
"We shall support him and continue to stand up for the freedom of the Latin American people."
"By means of yet another grotesque exercise in the distortion of reality, we are once again faced with an ignoble attempt by the European Parliament to interfere in Venezuela."
"In essence, this attempt forms part of the manoeuvres conducted by those conspiring against the democratic and sovereign process of emancipation and social progress initiated a decade ago by the Venezuelan people and reaffirmed in 14 electoral processes."
"Once again, what is really bothering the authors of this initiative is the fact that, despite all the problems, threats, dangers and interference, the Venezuelan people have been an example of the fact that it is worth fighting and that it is possible to build a fairer, more democratic and more peaceful country, and world."
"This is being demonstrated by the development of widespread popular participation, the reduction in levels of poverty, social inequality and unemployment, the fight against illiteracy and the extension of education to all levels, access by millions of Venezuelans to health, the national network of food markets at subsidised prices, the de facto nationalisation of the state oil industry and strategic sectors of the economy, the use of productive land by farmers, and solidarity with other peoples, among many other examples."
"We have to ask ourselves: in the end what right does this Parliament have to give lessons in democracy and respect for human rights, when it wants to impose a draft Treaty rejected by the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, when it adopts the inhumane Return Directive which violates the human rights of migrants, many of whom come from Latin America, and when it does not have a single word of condemnation for the barbaric aggression of Israel against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip?"
"For the umpteenth time we say: stop pretending that you can give lessons to the world."
"(NL) Madam President, I used to live in Venezuela myself and I am familiar with that country's past and, in particular, the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in the 1950s."
"Poverty and injustice were the hallmarks of life at the time, and I consider Hugo Chávez's government to be a very significant and much-needed improvement."
"Nevertheless, I am of the view that even a sympathetic government should behave decently towards its opponents and avoid employing any techniques which make life extra-difficult for its opponents."
"I will be voting in favour of the joint resolution for exactly that reason because it is critical with regard to protecting democracy in general and because it was not formulated with the aim of overturning what in my opinion is the beneficial regime of Hugo Chávez."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to correct Mr Guerreiro who is misinformed because, according to figures from the United Nations Development Programme, in the last 10 years Venezuela has not reduced poverty one iota."
"President Chávez has brought demagogy and dictatorship, unfortunately with support through the ballot boxes, but also with a great deal of intimidation of the people, as once again shown by this case of Manuel Rosales."
"I have met Manuel Rosales."
"I had the honour of meeting him on a visit to Venezuela."
"The fate that has befallen him is a great shame, because he wants to be a free man in his own country, but he cannot be a free man in his own country."
"That is the problem with Venezuela."
"I met him when he was governor-elect of the State of Zulia."
"He was elected by his people as Mayor of Maracaibo, but cannot live in his own country because, in Venezuela, people are persecuted and slandered."
"They are slandered, as is unfortunately happening with Manuel Rosales."
"It is the worst punishment that can be inflicted on a politician and we, who are politicians in this House, must all be aware of this."
"We can fight for our ideas, but we do not have the right to slander anyone, persecute them or throw them into jail."
"This is exactly what is happening in Venezuela."
"It is time, ladies and gentlemen, that we defined a strategy for Latin America."
"This must be a strategy of active diplomacy for Latin America."
"It must certainly be on the side of social progress, in line with the many millions that we invest every year in development and cooperation, but it must be 100% on the side of democracy, 100% on the side of pluralism, and 100% on the side of fundamental freedoms."
"Long live a free Venezuela!"
"(SK) Poverty always provides fertile soil for totalitarian leaders wishing to pose as the saviours and defenders of their people."
"In reality they do this only for their own benefit. At first, Hugo Chávez did not talk about socialism but only about the right to a better world."
"With the passage of time, however, he did start talking about socialism."
"His opponents were not invited to cooperate and they became his mortal enemies and later on political prisoners."
"He then interfered with media freedoms and those who would not toe the line were shut down. One-sided information, the leader-defender, violations of human rights, lack of freedom: this all adds up to totalitarianism."
"The case of Manuel Rosales only confirms what I am saying."
"Other leaders playing the same game as Hugo Chávez include Castro's heirs, Lukashenko and the like."
"I would like to thank all my fellow Members of the European Parliament for sending a clear signal to the whole world via these Thursday afternoons during the plenary session that the European Parliament will never tolerate human rights violations anywhere in the world."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you for chairing our meetings in the European Parliament, for your cooperation and for your personal friendship."
"(PL) Madam President, the current term of the European Parliament is drawing to a close, and so the time has come for a certain summing up."
"We can say objectively that we have done a huge amount of work, and that among the results of our work we can clearly see a commitment to protecting human rights and the effects of this."
"This is especially visible in third countries."
"We are capable of making a very thorough analysis, as we are doing today, of the situation in Iran, Madagascar and Venezuela."
"We can adopt suitable resolutions and even give them public effect."
"These resolutions do not always bring the desired results, but we are working at a long distance from the countries and societies which have these problems, and our communication and ability to implement and convey our ideas is not always particularly good."
"It is worse, ladies and gentlemen, with democracy and the protection of human rights within the European Union."
"This is an unpleasant and embarrassing matter."
"Today millions of people are working illegally."
"So what has happened to human rights?"
"The trafficking of children and women is flourishing."
"So where are human rights in the EU?"
"How are we protecting them?"
"Why are we not effective?"
"It must also be said that an unpleasant incident occurred when here in this Chamber we demonstrated for a referendum, and Mr Pöttering called in security, which was a breach of human rights and our right to demonstrate and express our views."
"Nevertheless, the overall result is positive, and I think that we should definitely continue this kind of debate, and this kind of action, in the next parliamentary term."
"Madam President, I rise on a point of order under our Rules of Procedure to make a personal statement."
"This is my valedictory speech to the European Parliament, since I was first elected a quarter of a century ago and my father was elected 30 years ago - Peter Beazley, a Member of the European Parliament for Bedfordshire and North Hertfordshire."
"I wish to thank all my fellow Members of this House, particularly our President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, with whom I had the honour of securing British Conservative membership of the Group of the European People's Party."
"I wish to recall the service of Lord Plumb - Henry Plumb - as President of this Parliament, of British Commissioners of all parties - Roy Jenkins (President), Arthur Cockfield, Chris Patton, Prime Minister Ted Heath and Winston Churchill - all true Europeans."
"The leader of my party, Mr David Cameron, has made a serious mistake."
"He is in error: he thinks that by becoming anti-European in the House of Commons this will secure him the premiership of my country."
"I, as a British Conservative, reserve the right to object - that is my final word."
"There are British Tories, Socialists, Liberals."
"We are Europeans."
"We will stand with our partners and our allies and, if my party leader seeks to rip up 30 years of work by British Tory pro-Europeans, he is wrong!"
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation.)"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission is closely following the situation in Venezuela with concern."
"The Commission is aware of the case of Manuel Rosales."
"He was granted political asylum in Peru after being charged with corruption in Venezuela."
"The Commission has taken note of the explanation provided by the president of Rosales' party, according to which he has gone into hiding for his own protection."
"The Commission believes that the request for asylum made by Manuel Rosales, and its acceptance by the Peruvian Government, is a bilateral case and that it is not for the Commission to pronounce itself on the merits of this request."
"We are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in Venezuela."
"We know that some sectors of Venezuelan society have criticised the proliferation of measures which they consider adversely affect the right to freedom of expression and the freedom to exercise political rights."
"This same sector considers that the Government is showing an intolerant attitude towards criticism."
"We are conscious of these facts and we are closely following the political situation in Venezuela."
"I would like to underline the importance that the European Union attaches to freedom of expression and opinion, a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law."
"We hope that the democratic institutions of Venezuela will respect the rule of law and preserve democracy in the country, whilst complying with the obligation arising from the international agreements signed and ratified by Venezuela, including the American Convention on Human Rights and, specifically, the provisions on political rights set out in Article 23."
"I wish to assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to follow developments in Venezuela closely."
"The Commission's commitment to supporting and strengthening democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms will continue to be reflected in our cooperation policies and relations with Venezuela."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law"
"1."
"Iran: the case of Roxana Saberi"
"Madam President, my proposal is that the words 'Iranian authorities' at the beginning of paragraph 3 should be replaced by 'Appeals Court at its hearing of 12 May'."
"Paragraph 3 would then read: 'Urges the Appeals Court at its hearing of 12 May to release Roxana Saberi...'."
"author. - Madam President, after this joint motion for a resolution was agreed and submitted, the news came of yet another disgracefully brutal case of stoning to death of a citizen in Iran."
"Therefore we thought it was appropriate to add to paragraph 7 the following: 'in this context insists that the authorities of Islamic Republic of Iran urgently abolish the practice of stoning; condemns strongly the recent execution by stoning of Vali Azad, and expresses great concern over the pending execution of Mohammad Ali Navid Khamami and Ashraf Kalhori;'."
"I understand that this meets with the approval of the other groups' representatives."
"2."
"Madagascar"
"author. - Madam President, concerning the next vote, on 'Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales', the Socialist Group, of course, has withdrawn its signature from the compromise resolution."
"We have not taken part in the debate and we will not take part in the vote."
"3."
"Venezuela: the case of Manuel Rosales"
"Thank you very much."
"This was a emotionally charged sitting, not only because of the human rights issues, but because it was our last sitting."
"Thank you for your participation."
"(PL) May I, on behalf of all Members of the European Parliament, and also our Parliamentary services and assistants, offer you, Madam President, our sincere thanks - to you personally, to the Bureau of the European Parliament and to the entire administration - for chairing the debates so well, for good cooperation and for mutual understanding."
"We wish you further success, re-election to Parliament, much satisfaction in your public activity and happiness in your personal life."
"Thank you very much."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank everyone in Parliament's services for their valuable work."

"Ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome you to the first sitting of the European Parliament following the elections and congratulate you all: the re-elected Members and the newly elected Members."
"A little under half of the 736 Members have been elected to the European Parliament for the first time."

"(Applause)"
"170 million citizens turned out to vote, and our work serves a great purpose: to unite our continent!"

"Election of the President of the European Parliament"
"This morning, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, we must elect the President."
"According to Rule 13 of the Rules of Procedure, candidates for the office of President of our Parliament must be nominated, with the consent of the people concerned, by a group or by at least 40 Members."
"Under the conditions provided for in the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the office of President of the European Parliament:"
"Mr Jerzy Buzek"
"Mrs Eva-Britt Svensson"
"The candidates have informed me that they consent to their nomination as candidates."
"Both candidates will now introduce themselves briefly, starting with Mrs Svensson."
"(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate all my fellow Members on the trust that has been shown in you by the citizens of your respective Member States."
"This is an enormous amount of trust and hence it is also an enormous responsibility for us all to meet our citizens' expectations and demands for the changes that are needed and to build a citizens' Europe."
"Democracy, the right to choose their elected representatives, is the most important instrument that our citizens have."
"To be able to talk of true democracy requires more than the right to vote."
"It requires openness, transparency and an open debate."
"I would therefore like to say that it is extremely important for us now to ensure that we reform the first reading procedure."
"We must take the trust shown in Parliament seriously and demonstrate the openness that is also required with regard to the first reading procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing huge challenges: an economic crisis with higher unemployment, increased exclusion and social insecurity."
"We have a climate crisis that has already resulted in climate refugees."
"As usual, it is the poorest people that are hit first and hardest."
"We see an EU and a world full of injustice and poverty."
"There are, however, political solutions to these crises, but they require a change in policy."
"The policy that has been pursued up to now has not solved the problems that we have been responsible for solving."
"On the contrary, in many areas it has helped to create the crises."
"We need a change in policy."
"We need a policy for a social Europe, a policy that promotes workers' rights to protection against social dumping."
"We need a policy that prevents social marginalisation and poverty."
"We need a policy that safeguards the participation of all citizens."
"We need a policy that does not discriminate against any citizen, regardless of ethnicity, disability, gender, age or sexual orientation."
"I would like to see an EU that protects the interests of all its citizens."
"I want to see a policy that creates new jobs - new green jobs."
"We need to invest in green technology, which - in addition to creating the new jobs that are needed - will also help to create growth and put a stop to climate change, which is one of the most fundamentally important tasks that humanity and Europe are facing."
"I want to see an EU that takes responsibility for ensuring fair and responsible international trade."
"I want to see an EU with a humane asylum and immigration policy that protects immigrants and their rights."
"I want to see a diverse Europe."
"This is how we generate development."
"I want to see a diverse Europe in which every citizen receives protection."
"I want to see a Europe, an EU, that takes responsibility for human rights."
"When human rights are repressed, regardless of where in the world it takes place, we can never, ever compromise."
"These rights are inviolable and this applies to every single human being."
"Regardless of whether it is a question of freedom of expression, public access, privacy or whatever else, human rights are always inviolable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our responsibility to stand up for human rights, wherever in the world they are under threat."
"I was pleased to hear the President say that the elections in June increased the representation of women in this Parliament."
"This was made possible by the joint efforts of both men and women."
"We worked together to increase the representation of women."
"We are now going a step further and ensuring that we increase the influence of women, including when it comes to positions of responsibility in Parliament and the other institutions of the EU."
"This is our opportunity."
"Together, ladies and gentlemen, we can show the citizens of Europe that we are assuming responsibility and demonstrate the emergence of a modern, diverse society."
"Today, each one of you has the power of your vote."
"You have the power to send out a strong message to our citizens that we are now building a citizens' Europe, a social Europe, to demonstrate to both our citizens and the world around us that the EU is prepared to take responsibility for global justice, human rights and the global environment and to demonstrate the power we have with our votes to send out the message that European citizens are expecting of this Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"I will now announce the result of the vote."
"Number of voters: 713"
"Voting slips that were not filled in or were invalid: 69"
"Votes cast: 644"
"Absolute majority: 323"
"Jerzy Buzek received 555 votes."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Mrs Eva-Britt Svensson received 89 votes."
"(Applause)"
"Jerzy Buzek has therefore received the absolute majority of the votes cast."
"I will therefore repeat in my own language what I tried to say in Polish: I congratulate Mr Buzek most sincerely on his convincing election and wish him all the best in the wonderful job that he is about to take over, and I would ask him to take his place here in the President's chair."
"(Applause)"
"Dear colleagues, thank you for electing me President of the European Parliament."
"For me it is both an enormous challenge and a great honour."
"Thank you to those who voted for me;"
"I will do everything not to disappoint your trust."
"For those of you who did not vote for me, I will try to convince you to me."
"I wish to work with all of you, regardless of political conventions."
"I count on your support."
"Thank you, Mrs Svensson, for taking part in this election and for our discussions."
"To our colleagues, Mario Mauro and Graham Watson, who stood as candidates and resigned early in order to strengthen the unity of our House, this was a profound gesture."
"Mario, I know how important for you human rights are."
"In my homeland, Solidarność was born, a great movement for human rights, ..."
"(Applause)"
"...which was possible thanks to the lesson of John Paul II."
"For me, human rights will also be a priority."
"Graham, you spoke about the necessity of change in the European Parliament, of the need for reform, of the need to involve in the European project our citizens, who are becoming more and more indifferent."
"I will make sure that, together, we will do everything we can to change this."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it was unexpected, but it is a joy - I believe - for everyone here no longer to have an Eastern or a Western Europe for the first time in this Parliament."
"We simply have a Europe that is symbolised by our President, who is in the Chamber today."
"(Applause)"
"This is unity; this is also where our responsibilities lie, as you said earlier, Mr Buzek."
"Forgetting about East and West, in the two and a half years of your presidency, and speaking only of a single Europe - that is my wish, for you and for Europe."
"Mr President, on behalf of our group I would like to congratulate you on your election."
"We supported your election and, even though we should be careful not to overuse the term 'historic moment', I believe that your election as President of the European Parliament is indeed an historic moment."
"(Applause)"
"The fact that 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, six years after the accession of your country and many other Central and Eastern European countries to the European Union - which was after all a process that you yourself initiated as Prime Minister of your country, as the accession negotiations took place during your term of office - the fact that 20 years after putting an end to the division of the world into two heavily armed blocs, after overcoming the Stalinist dictatorships of the states which had to suffer 40 years longer under these dictatorships than the western part of Europe did under the fascist dictatorships, the fact that 20 years later it is only natural that Members from Poland, Hungary, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic or Slovakia should be sitting together with Members from France, Portugal, Finland, Germany, Austria or Italy in this Chamber and that we are able to elect as head of this assembly a representative of Solidarność, a democratically elected head of the Polish Government, in a free, secret and fair election - that is in my view an historic moment, which proves that Europe - this great continent in which 27 states have united to become the European Union - actually represents something, and that is that the dream of democracy and freedom can become reality if we do not merely dream, but also actively work to bring it about, as you have done in your life."
"I therefore believe that your Presidency is also an appeal to all of us and that the values on which this Union was founded are the values that drove the dictators to the wall and overcame the dictatorships."
"It is the wish of our group that your Presidency will be based on these values."
"My sincere congratulations, Mr Buzek."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all congratulations from the Liberal and Democratic Group on your election."
"I can tell you that you have the full support of the Liberal and Democratic Group for the forthcoming years in your work."
"Your work, from our point of view, means the creation of a more integrated European Union and a European Union that uses the community method."
"You have become President at a very difficult time: we have to ratify the Lisbon Treaty; we have to find a single strategy against the economic and financial crisis."
"It is a huge task in which you have the full support of our group."
"You should know that you have behind you a large pro-European majority in this Parliament."
"You should be aware of that."
"(Applause)"
"The only request we have is to use it, this large pro-European majority. To go forward with Europe and also to say what you have to say in the European Council, that you know so well - as I do."
"I hope that you can make your voice heard there and have more 'Europe' in that institution also."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on behalf of my group."
"We are also very happy about your election."
"I think that it is a slight understatement, Mr President, when you say that it is an honour for you to take up the position to which we have elected you today."
"It is, on the contrary, an honour for us - at least from the point of view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - to have you as President."
"Everything you have done in your political career has helped you to achieve your current position, and we are all putting our trust in you."
"I am not sure if it will be possible in two and a half years to overcome the division that still exists between East and West, but I believe that, with you at the head of this House, we can strengthen bridges between East and West."
"I personally would like it to be clear to the Members from Western Europe that Poland is in the middle of the continent, that you come from a country at the heart of the continent and that the work to forge links with the East must now be carried out much more intensively than it has been in the past."
"You are in the best position to do this."
"I was very pleased to hear you say that we need to get closer to our citizens."
"We in the Group of the Greens will always support you in this."
"Strengthening Europe from within is important, but it is also important to think about Europe on a larger scale."
"Allow me to express yet another personal wish."
"As I got to know you particularly well on the streets and in the squares of Kiev during the Orange Revolution - and you were a very courageous politician even then - let us not forget Ukraine in our consideration of the countries to the east of the EU."
"The situation there also needs to improve."
"Something I would like to do during the European Football Championships - which are not long away now and which will be hosted in Poland and Ukraine - is to watch one or two matches with you."
"I wish you every success in your new role!"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, may I congratulate you on your presidency and in particular welcome the fact that in your remarks you have referred to history - and others have referred to it as well."
"You certainly seem to be someone who will value the freedoms which this House wishes to have: the freedom of expression, but also the freedoms of looking ahead, of change and reform in Europe, and that this House must change and reform with Europe."
"The fact that you have a history of which you are proud, and rightfully so, from 1980 in Solidarność and onwards, where you brought Poland into NATO and then started the negotiations for membership of the European Union, you are someone who can embrace the changes that Europe needs now."
"We welcome you."
"We will do our very best to help you in the job that you have taken on."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I am pleased that a neighbour from Poland has become President of this House."
"I come from eastern Germany and work near Słubice."
"Słubice and Frankfurt/Oder are both part of a united Europe."
"I would like to thank you for focusing in particular on the continued integration of Eastern and Western Europe."
"There is still much to do in this respect, as we are all aware."
"However, I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe."
"I hope that I will soon be able to speak to you in more depth."
"I have started to work towards this."
"Two of my sons speak Polish."
"I once had the honour of presenting the Andrzej Wajda film prize to the director Andreas Dresen and of making a speech to mark the occasion."
"Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture."
"I hope that Western Europe and Eastern Europe will not forget the special achievements of Eastern European culture."
"Mr President, you have our respect and our support!"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on being elected although I feel that this morning it has been more like a papal inauguration."
"If this Parliament were a proper Parliament, it would actually select Members to sit in the chair on ability and not have the usual big group stitch-ups."
"That is rather a shame."
"I think the signs for change here are not very good."
"Just yesterday we had armed Eurocorps soldiers carrying the European flag round the courtyard outside, a sort of European Union version of trooping the colour."
"We had an orchestra, we had the anthem, we had a choir; we started today, did we not, with the anthem."
"This is the same flag and anthem that you said had been dropped after the French and Dutch very sensibly said 'no' to the dreaded EU Constitution."
"You are not even pretending any more."
"You are pushing ahead with all the symbols of statehood and trying at the same time to lie and cheat to the Irish by giving them a series of guarantees that are not worth the paper that they are written on."
"Well, I can tell you that many of us in this Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group will do all we can to help the 'no' side in that Irish referendum."
"(Heckling)"
"The future of European democracy rests very heavily on Irish shoulders."
"Mr President, you fought against the Soviet Union."
"You fought for democracy."
"You fought for national self-determination."
"If you continue to ignore the democratic voice of countries like France, the Netherlands and Ireland, then you will turn the European Union back into that very Union that you fought so hard against."
"Listen to the people, please."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Thank you for your speech, Mr Farage."
"European parliamentarianism has always provided a forum for various opinions."
"This is what discussion in Europe is based on."
"The speeches of those Members who wished to speak have now ended, but I think that the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, is signalling that he would like to say a few words."
"Mr Barroso, please take the floor."
"Mr President, I should like, both personally and on behalf of the European Commission, to congratulate you most sincerely on your election to the presidency of the European Parliament."
"The path that you have taken has led you courageously to defend freedom, democracy and the rule of law in order to help impose them in your own country, Poland."
"Your political career has taken you as far as the office of prime minister, before you were elected as an MEP."
"You are the first President of this House to come from a Member State in Central or Eastern Europe."
"It is armed with this wealth of exceptional experience and with the values that you uphold that, today, you assume your new role as President of the European Parliament."
"Twenty years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall, and five years on from enlargement, your election is a victory for reunified Europe."
"There are many of us here who know of and appreciate your personality, your political vision and your campaign work."
"There are just as many of us who believe that your personal qualities naturally predispose you to play the role of a President who actively and passionately defends the interests of Europe and its citizens."
"This experience and these values will mean that the handover from Mr Pöttering - who knows this institution better than anyone - to you will be a harmonious one."
"I send Mr Pöttering my best wishes now that he is leaving office; he has carried out his role with extraordinary dignity and with an unwavering belief in Europe."
"At a time of difficulties, and given the complex political model that we have, we shall have to work now more than ever in a positive, constructive and united spirit, in order to make progress with Europe."
"The power and the competences of this Parliament will also be strengthened with the Treaty of Lisbon, which an overwhelming majority of Parliament, and the Commission, want to adopt; in fact, a treaty that has already been adopted by 26 parliaments of our Europe deserves the respect of all MEPs."
"Our institutions must strengthen one another for the sake of the European project."
"This is particularly true as regards the relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"We know perfectly well that it is the cooperation between our two institutions that moves the European project forward."
"Mr President, my dear friend, all that remains is for me to wish you, and the new Parliament, success in your work towards establishing a Europe that more fully promotes the values of freedom and solidarity."
"(FR) Mr President, I had resigned myself to being overlooked to some extent, in the same way as my non-attached colleagues, for whom I certainly speak in offering you the congratulations that are due to yourself, but rather less, it must be said, to the method of your election, since your triumphant election is, in a way, the result of an agreement between the two main groups of this House, which oppose one another rather artificially at election time and then go on to jointly manage Parliament for five years."
"Mr President, I hope that you are the master of your victory, that you do not become a slave to these two main groups, that you are able to defend the rights of minorities and, in particular, the rights of dissidents such as ourselves, of those who are concerned about the effects of economic globalisation on their identity, and of the universal mixing of people, goods and capital, who do not believe that this necessarily brings benefits and who condemn the indefinite increase in the European Union's powers with regard to their national freedoms."
"We are, in a way, dissidents just as you once were."
"We hope that you will protect the rights of dissidents and, in particular, that you will attach great importance to respect for these Rules of Procedure, which should not be systematically amended, since it is clear that they can benefit those who are, I believe, the true defenders of the freedoms of the European nations."
"(Applause)"
"Election of Vice-Presidents (deadline for submitting nominations): see Minutes"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, please take your seats."
"We will start in three minutes."
"Election of Vice-Presidents (first, second and third ballots)"
"Mr President, I would like to ask whether there is any minimum requirement for the vote."
"Mr Szájer, there is no minimum number: you can leave one person or two persons; it does not matter."
"Dear colleagues, allow me to say a few words at the beginning."
"During the break in the sitting it came to my attention that an Italian soldier was killed today in Afghanistan in the NATO-led mission there."
"His death comes after 15 British soldiers were killed in the past month."
"I think we always need to remember our men and women in the armed forces who are on missions abroad, often in dangerous situations, so that they know they are not forgotten."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, I am truly sorry but, for the sake of a clear vote, since we do not have a display and we have tried to keep up with your very quick delivery, please could you read out the names and the votes again a little more slowly?"
"Mr President, put the numbers on the screen so that we can all see them."
"It is not very difficult."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would urge you very strongly to ring the bell, as I see that a lot of Members from all groups are not here."
"Many people are under the impression that the vote is not due to start until 19.30."
"I would therefore ask you to ring the bell one more time."

"(FR) Mr President, the Lithuanian Parliament voted yesterday for a law on homosexuality, on propaganda on homosexuality and bisexuality."
"The Lithuanian President had already refused to sign this law."
"It was referred back to the parliament."
"This law is in direct opposition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6(1) of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I call on you, Mr President, on behalf of this Parliament, to protest against this law in the name of European values, since the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as reproduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, provides for non-discrimination in relation to sexual orientation, and this law discriminates against sexual minorities."
"On behalf of this Parliament, I call on you to write to the Lithuanian Parliament to state that this law goes against the common idea of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you."
"We proceed to a presentation of the order of business."
"(FR) Mr President, can you tell me whether or not you are going to act?"
"I have asked you to do something; you should tell me whether or not you are going to do it."
"That is what I asked you."
"I will find out what the Lithuanian Parliament has adopted and then I will decide what to do."
"I will be in touch with you about this."
"Order of business: see Minutes"
"Outcome of the European Council (18-19 June 2009) - Term in office of the Czech Presidency (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the European Council report and the Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council (18-19 June 2009)"
"the statement by the outgoing Presidency of the Council on the term in office of the Czech Presidency."
"I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr Jan Fischer."
"I would also like to extend a warm welcome to the President of the European Commission, Mr José Manuel Barroso."
"We have before us the statement by the outgoing Presidency of the Council on the term in office of the Czech Presidency."
"Please allow me to say a few words at the outset."
"Yesterday we inaugurated the seventh term of the European Parliament."
"You entrusted me with the job, the responsibility, the great privilege and the honour of presiding over the European Parliament for the next two and a half years."
"I would like, today, on this second day, to thank you very warmly once again, to thank you for the trust which you have placed in me."
"I will do everything to convince you that your decision was the right one."
"In the first half of 2009 the Presidency was held by a second country from the group which acceded to the European Union barely five years ago."
"We have, therefore, opportunity to become increasingly united and to come closer together."
"We are conscious that it was a difficult Presidency because of the crisis and also because of the energy problems."
"There was also a crisis in Gaza."
"We also had the elections to the European Parliament."
"However, as you know, during elections to the European Parliament there is less contact between the Presidency, Parliament and the European Commission."
"Today we want to hear how the outgoing Czech Presidency sees the past six months and what conclusions and principal comments it has about what we should do in the near future."
"I would like, therefore, to ask the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic to speak and to present the opinion of the Presidency on the past six months and on what should happen in the near future."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to be able to greet you at the opening of your five-year mandate."
"The Czech Presidency has come to an end and a new European Parliament is just starting out."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election and on the fact that you have been entrusted by the voters in your countries to represent them in this important European body."
"I congratulate Jerzy Buzek on his election as President of the European Parliament, along with all of the Vice-Presidents elected yesterday, and I wish you all much success in your important work and in the fulfilment of all the ideas with which you commence your work in the European Parliament."
"The Czech Republic is drawing up an account of its six-month leadership of the European Council for a different Parliament to the one that was in place when it assumed the role."
"This changes nothing in terms of our own assessment of our Presidency, of course."
"On the contrary, I see it rather as a confirmation of continuity in European politics."
"In the same way, by tackling the effects of the global economic crisis and the issues of energy and energy security, the new Swedish Presidency will continue to fulfil two of the main tasks which occupied us."
"The first half of this year will go down in the history of the European Union as a period of demanding tests arising from a complex economic and political situation."
"We anticipated some of these tests, in particular the continuing and already full-blown economic crisis and the need to complete the institutional reform of the EU."
"Others were unexpected and some were entirely unexpected, such as the conflict in Gaza and the crisis over Russian gas supplies in the very first hours of the Czech Presidency."
"Our ability to run the Presidency was then put to the test, of course, due to events on the domestic political scene, when the Czech Republic changed government just as we were two thirds of the way through the Presidency."
"Unlike many people, I do not think that the political crisis in the Czech Republic seriously damaged the EU as a whole, although I agree that the fall of the government was unfortunate."
"Nevertheless, I firmly believe that we handled the administration of our Presidency without faltering and that we managed over the entire six months to fulfil our priorities - the planned tasks arising from the EU agenda - and to deal with unexpected topical issues on a continuous basis and with total engagement."
"This was also due to the fact that the specialist teams in the Czech Republic all carried on working with total commitment, loyalty and one hundred percent professionalism."
"It was also due to the fact that the Czech Presidency received full backing from the Commission following the change of government."
"I benefited personally from the support of Commission President José Manuel Barroso and I also received strong support at the time - if you will allow me to add a personal note here - from various Member State representatives."
"This was an enormous help at the time, both for the Czech Government and for me personally."
"I would like to give notice that I shall not be indulging in any philosophical or political analyses."
"I do not want to weigh up the political dimensions or cogency of EU leadership under large versus small countries or old versus new countries or the pros and cons of political versus bureaucratic governments in the country holding the Presidency."
"I will leave that to others and for the rest I will say only that a decent and open-minded analysis requires a certain amount of distance and the falling away of emotions and short-term interests."
"From now on I will eschew grand words and pathos."
"I would rather concentrate on bare facts backed up by statistics where appropriate - as statistics is after all my life-long profession and possibly even my passion - or on what Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic, called the small everyday tasks."
"As you know, the, Czech Republic expressed its main presidential priorities as the 'Three Es': the economy, energy policy and the EU's role in the world."
"Circumstances, I think, have demonstrated clearly that these were highly topical, valid themes and their validity is by no means limited to the first half of 2009."
"They are areas that will continue to require all of our combined efforts in the future, in order for the Union to stand its ground even in times of instability and to benefit its citizens - which is the main reason for it being here."
"They are priorities which put the idea of integration to the test, demonstrating in practice how faithful we are to the values which were there at the birth of the Community and which define Europe as a common area of freedom, security and prosperity."
"We selected the motto of 'Europe without barriers' to represent this effort symbolically."
"The economic crisis tested our faithfulness to the idea of integration to the full, adding an even more urgent significance to the Czech Presidency's motto."
"The results of the many discussions held over the past half-year and the conclusions of the European Councils show that the twenty-seven Member States passed this test with flying colours."
"Under the Czech Presidency we turned our backs on protectionism and we agreed on a common and coordinated approach to dealing with the effects of the crisis both in an EU context and on the international stage."
"In the same way we succeeded in fulfilling a task which many thought us incapable of; the issue of institutional reform."
"The Czech Republic itself successfully completed the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by both chambers of parliament."
"This was a clear and convincing expression of political will and it opened up the possibility of a credible solution to the question of the Irish guarantees."
"I firmly believe that, as a result of the guarantees agreed on at the June European Council, there is a good chance that Ireland will complete the Treaty ratification process as well, so that it can enter into force by the end of 2009."
"The Czech Presidency also took a serious approach to a task that is connected with the election of this new European Parliament, namely initiating the process of appointing a Commission for the next legislative period 2009-2014."
"At the June European Council a clear political consensus was achieved on José Manuel Barroso as the candidate for President of the next Commission."
"The authority for the Czech Presidency and the incoming Swedish Presidency to hold talks with the European Parliament creates the preconditions for preserving institutional continuity."
"Overall, the Czech Presidency has managed to achieve a series of concrete results or visible progress in all three priority areas."
"In the legislative area, negotiations over more than 80 concrete measures were brought to a successful conclusion, thanks above all to close cooperation with the Member States and EU institutions, particularly the European Parliament."
"In the non-legislative area a series of notable successes were also achieved, including the handling of the foreign policy and energy crises at the beginning of the year, the rejection of protectionist tendencies, decisive measures in support of the European economy, steps towards diversification of energy supply and climate protection and the results of negotiations with key partners in the European Union."
"As far as the individual priorities are concerned, the most important task in the economic sphere was to deal with the effects of the global crisis and to continue implementing the European plan for economic recovery as one of the main instruments for restoring economic prosperity."
"We also passed muster concerning the measures adopted for stabilising the banking sector."
"The measures we adopted are effective."
"Through guarantees and recapitalisation, Member States provided the banks with potential support amounting to more than 30% of the European Union's GDP."
"The compromise achieved over the EUR 5 billion package for projects in the area of energy and broadband internet and measures to verify the efficiency of the common agricultural policy provided a positive message from the spring European Council."
"The agreement over the contribution of EU Member States towards the EUR 75 billion loan for boosting International Monetary Fund resources was of key significance in terms of tackling the global economic crisis."
"Under the Czech Presidency, the EU, with strong support from the Commission, made a major contribution to the excellent preparations for and successful course of the G20 summit in London, which produced agreement over the major boost to IMF resources and over the resources disbursed through other international institutions to combat the effects of the global economic recession."
"The EU also gained a strong position at the summit thanks to the common conclusions adopted at the spring European Council."
"In this way it confirmed its ambition to be a strong global player."
"As I said earlier, all of the measures aimed at combating the crisis during the Czech Presidency must be viewed against the backdrop of the joint and unequivocal rejection of protectionism."
"In the area of legislative measures, the Czech Presidency managed to achieve a consensus within the framework of the recovery plan over the possibility of applying reduced VAT rates for labour-intensive locally-provided services."
"This agreement makes a significant contribution towards maintaining employment in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy and should help small and medium-sized companies in particular."
"The changes to financial market regulation and market supervision represent a whole chapter in the effort to combat the current financial and economic crisis."
"During the Czech Presidency major progress was achieved in restoring confidence."
"We completed negotiations on all of the key legislative proposals which the Presidency established as its objectives."
"Chief among these was the Solvency II Directive for the areas of insurance, regulations for rating agencies and others. In the challenging debate on the regulation and supervision of financial markets, agreement was reached over the basic elements of reform, which should provide stability at the Member State level and at the level of individual financial institutions and their rules."
"The June European Council confirmed the direction taken by the Commission."
"The support voiced for the Commission's plans should lead to concrete legislative proposals being drawn up and approved in the autumn of this year."
"Energy policy, the second priority of the Czech Presidency, was severely tested in the very first days of the Presidency."
"At the same time, we saw that it is not always sensible to tackle the problems of energy crises on an ad hoc basis, since a crisis blows up every six months or so."
"We should rather adopt systematic measures so that the EU can be secure and resilient in terms of energy supplies."
"Under the Czech Presidency we took steps to boost energy security, focusing on activities that will increase diversification of energy sources and supply routes through the so-called southern corridor."
"The support for energy efficiency included in the revised regulations for the European Regional Development Fund also makes a significant contribution to energy security."
"It enables financial investments to be made in greater energy efficiency and in the use of renewable energy sources in residential buildings."
"This provides a link to the Swedish Presidency, which has energy efficiency as one of its key priorities."
"The continuity necessary to the work of the entire EU is again apparent here."
"Last, but by no means least, the March and June Councils confirmed in full that it would not be sensible to abandon our ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions or for financing mitigation and adaptation measures in developing countries."
"At the same time, we established clear priorities and goals which must be fulfilled ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen this December in order for the EU to defend its position as a leader in climate change."
"The third priority - or if you will the third 'E' - of the Czech Presidency was about the EU in the world, and events demonstrate clearly how important it is for the EU to develop and pursue a common foreign policy."
"There was ample confirmation of this during the course of the Czech Presidency."
"While the EU succeeded in solving the gas crisis thanks to its unity, the second crisis from the start of the year, the crisis in Gaza, again showed that if the EU wants to be a truly global player it must learn to speak with one voice."
"Both of these crises occurred under the one Presidency, which goes to show that the issue of who is actually leading the EU does not matter so much as the unity of all twenty-seven Member States."
"The Czech Presidency succeeded in kicking off the Eastern Partnership project which is a continuation of the neighbourhood policy, this time in an eastward direction."
"The main foreign priority of the Czech Presidency was to continue the process of EU enlargement."
"This mainly involved a European perspective for the countries of the Western Balkans."
"Due to the situation in the region, the Presidency had limited room for manoeuvre."
"However, despite the suspension of accession talks with Croatia, progress was achieved in the process of visa liberalisation."
"I have presented a brief and matter-of-fact summary of the priorities of the Czech Presidency and their fulfilment."
"More detailed information is of course available and I am now available myself to respond to your questions and comments."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the first plenary session of a newly elected European Parliament is a unique political moment."
"It opens a legislative term that will influence the daily lives of hundreds of millions of European citizens and the fate of an entire continent."
"I should like sincerely to congratulate all the MEPs who have just been elected."
"Your presence in this Chamber is the result of the greatest exercise in transnational democracy ever staged in the world."
"I wish you every success for your term of office."
"The challenges faced by Europe and those that it will have to take up over the next few years are immense."
"Firstly, there is the economic and financial crisis, which requires us to continue the systematic coordinated action that we have embarked on."
"There is the social cost of this crisis, which is our top priority."
"There is the fight against climate change and the transition to a green and sustainable economy, which shows the political direction we need to go in."
"All these challenges have also distinguished the Czech Presidency, which has just come to an end."
"I should like to congratulate Prime Minister Fischer and his predecessor, Mirek Topolánek, on the results obtained during a particularly difficult phase."
"I thank them and their entire team for their excellent cooperation, despite some internal political difficulties."
"I should also like to highlight the political significance of this Czech Presidency."
"For the first time, a country which, only a few years ago, was a member of the Warsaw Pact has been in charge of our European project of freedom and solidarity."
"This is a very important point, which shows the extent to which we have progressed within our Europe."
"During the Czech Presidency we have been able to achieve some impressive results in practice: 54 texts have been adopted by codecision."
"I should like to mention in particular the agreement on a wide range of measures on regulation of the financial markets and on the EUR 5 billion in the context of the European recovery plan, and you are all very well aware of how hard we, the Commission and Parliament, have had to fight to achieve this."
"I would also mention the review of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I welcome the development of the internal energy market and of the internal transport market."
"In all of these areas there were ambitious proposals from the Commission, which were supported by this Parliament."
"I welcome the unanimous support of the last European Council for the road map that the Commission proposed on the subject of supervision of the financial markets."
"We now have an ambitious consensus that no one could have hoped for a few months ago when I convened a group of high-level experts under the chairmanship of Mr de Larosière."
"This will enable us to spearhead the reform of the international financial system."
"Moreover, it was in this same spirit that we took part in the G20 in London, prompting some very important decision-making."
"Beyond its legislative work, the Czech Presidency has also been able to confront challenges of a political nature, some of which were extremely sensitive, indeed extremely serious."
"We have had to manage the gas crisis between Ukraine and Russia, which has again highlighted the need for Europe to strengthen its energy security."
"Over the last six months we have made much progress, for example by developing the Baltic interconnection plan."
"The day before yesterday I attended the ceremony of the signing of the Nabucco project between Turkey and four of our Member States - Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania - in the presence of many countries from which we hope to import gas in the future."
"This is a truly European project, and I am proud that the Commission has been able to act as a facilitator in it, since this role has been recognised as essential for all the participants."
"Mr President, during the Czech Presidency there were also very important developments concerning the Lisbon Treaty."
"The last European Council agreed the necessary guarantees that allow the Irish Government to call a second referendum, fully reassured that the concerns expressed by Irish people have been addressed satisfactorily."
"Let us not forget that it was also during the Czech Presidency that the Czech Senate finalised parliamentary ratification, bringing the total number of Member States that have completed the parliamentary approval process to 26."
"The Czech Presidency has now passed the baton to the Swedish Presidency, but the challenges Europe faces continue and go well beyond the scope of a single presidency."
"The European project has always been a long-term one."
"We make progress when we work as a team."
"Like a team, every member is vital to success: the Council, the Commission and Parliament all have an important role to play in meeting our common European ambitions at the service of Europe's citizens."
"The Europe we must continue to build together is a strong Europe, an open Europe, a Europe of solidarity."
"It is a Europe that offers a maximum of opportunities to its citizens; a Europe that builds on its continental dimension and draws full benefit from the potential of its internal market, so crucial for consumers and for small- and medium-sized companies; a Europe of knowledge and innovation; a Europe that respects the environment and ensures its energy security; a Europe that reaches out to other global actors in a spirit of partnership in order to tackle shared challenges together."
"In this time of global crisis, we need a strong Europe more than ever before - and a strong Europe means a united Europe ready to seize and shape its destiny."
"Let us work together - Parliament, Council, Commission - to show that the expectations of Europe's citizens are safe in our hands; that their desire for freedom, justice and solidarity will not go ignored."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel deeply moved as I stand here in the European Parliament as the first deaf person able to address you in my mother tongue, Hungarian sign language."
"I do so not only for myself and the deaf community, but also for every disadvantaged person."
"I am now beginning to feel that I belong to a European community where even minorities can achieve success."
"Just take Robert Schuman as an example, who was from Alsace-Lorraine and went on to become the founding father of the EU 50 years ago."
"Around the end of the EU's outgoing Czech Presidency, a turn of events unfortunately took place which I would also like to bring to the attention of the EU's incoming Swedish Presidency."
"Two weeks ago the Slovak Parliament adopted a regulation which will seriously restrict the rights of the minorities living in that country to use their own language."
"As a user of sign language, I feel it is my duty to stand up for the rights of people in Europe to use their own language and for the importance of this."
"This is the reason why I am going to be working here in the European Parliament."
"However, I want to give a message to every European citizen."
"I want a Europe where everyone is guaranteed the right to live their life to the full and fulfil their potential."
"I want a Europe where deaf people represented by me or any person living with a disability, for that matter, really do enjoy equal opportunities."
"I would like to say a particular word of thanks to Joseph Daul, Chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), for giving me the opportunity to address you on this special day."
"This also proves that Europe really is about diversity, tolerance and equal opportunities."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (CS) Prime Minister Fischer, Commission President Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, in January this year I warned this honourable assembly that the Czech Presidency would not be easy and that it would probably be marked by major instability."
"The reason for my fears was the instability within the Czech Government coalition, the disagreements between government and opposition and the disputes between government and president."
"I would like to say briefly that the speech made by Czech President Václav Klaus to this honourable assembly unfortunately confirmed my fears of instability, showing that the Presidency would indeed be marked by instability, and not just through the collapse of the government."
"Despite this, some things have been successful over the six months, others less so."
"On the plus side I would mention the energy policy referred to earlier."
"I think that the Czech Republic managed very well in resolving the gas crisis of January this year."
"The signing of the Nabucco agreement, mentioned here by Mr Barroso, was also the result of work done by the Czech Presidency."
"Unfortunately, the handling of the economic crisis did not fulfil the expectations of Europe and the European Parliament."
"Let us recall the speech of former Czech Prime Minister Topolánek, when he sent US President Obama to hell, along with his economic policy."
"Despite this, I would like in conclusion to thank Prime Minister Fischer in particular for rescuing the Czech Presidency."
"The June summit is proof of this, since the entire agenda of the summit was successfully implemented."
"I would also like to thank the hundreds of Czech officials, not only in Brussels but in all of the Czech ministries."
"In my opinion these officials did a very good and professional job and they cannot be held responsible for what was happening on the Czech political scene."
"Mr President, allow me, first of all, to congratulate you on your election."
"I wish you every success over the next two and a half years."
"I was even able to understand your last request to keep to our speaking time without using headphones."
"Prime Minister, your predecessor did not have an easy or positive start."
"The emphasis was quite rightly placed on energy, economy and external relations, but as is so often the case in life, what happens in reality is sometimes very different to what we had planned."
"In the Gaza conflict, the Council Presidency rushed straight in without first having agreed on a common European approach."
"In the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine, millions of people were freezing before your government stepped forward and acted as an intermediary, with very successful results."
"Despite the criticism, you were also successful in other areas."
"It is a lasting achievement of the Czech Presidency that the European Union did not make the mistake of sliding into protectionism, as was the case in the 1930s."
"That was and still is a real danger."
"On this issue the Presidency took a clear line, supported in particular by the Competition Commissioner."
"Many people want to use the crisis to promote a new economic nationalism."
"That would be catastrophic."
"For Liberals and Democrats, free and fair competition, as provided for in the Treaties, is the way to growth and prosperity."
"However, if our citizens are to accept free competition, they want and need to be certain that the rules are the same for everyone."
"The distortion of competition, foreclosure, a preference for a state's own national companies - all these things will lead not to the end of the crisis, but straight up a blind alley."
"During its Presidency, the Czech Republic, as a new Member State, rightly had to issue many old Member States with a call to order, which was unfortunately necessary in view of the fact that the internal market must not be eroded and rules must be followed."
"The Czech Government proved ultimately to be helpless in the face of the constant harassment from Prague Castle and the vote of no confidence."
"Its fall in the middle of its presidential term was unprecedented."
"The whole of Europe looked to Prague in amazement."
"With this move, the Czech political class did a disservice both to its own country and to Europe."
"Prime Minister, you have however shown that, in politics just as in football, a game can still turn even if substitutions are not made until it has gone into extra time."
"In the European Council in June the course was set for an overhaul of financial market supervision."
"It is now the task of the Commission to carry this initiative forward with determination."
"You have negotiated the guarantees for Ireland so that, hopefully, the referendum on 2 October will be successful."
"The Member States have formally agreed on a candidate for the office of President of the Commission and thus met an important demand by our group."
"Prime Minister, you personally have done a good job and gained a great deal of respect."
"However, the first Czech Presidency will probably not take the place in the history books that we had all hoped it would."
"What we nevertheless ought to remember is your motto: 'Europe without borders'."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, it is not easy to weigh up the progress that ought to have been made during the period of the Czech Presidency."
"I have tried very hard to do this on behalf of my group, but what we would have liked to have seen - namely the Czech Presidency rising to the challenges - did not actually happen."
"With regard to the financial crisis, when we reconvene here in September after the summer break we will have been talking about the required new regulation of the financial markets for a whole year, but we will have made virtually no progress in this regard."
"A lot of statements have been made that are intended to reassure citizens, but not very much is actually being done."
"As regards the economic crisis, the European recovery plan - I find it almost embarrassing that this is mentioned so often - is however merely a token programme to enable us to talk about European recovery planning, but it lacks any real substance. It runs to a mere EUR 5 billion and then there is the petty dispute about how this EUR 5 billion should be used."
"I do not think that this is something we ought to be proud of."
"A programme that we have worked hard on, namely a consistent programme for energy efficiency in Europe, which would safeguard millions of jobs, has not been given any real consideration."
"I now turn to the climate crisis and I hardly need to ask green politicians to evaluate the policy in this area."
"Ivo de Boer, the United Nations' top climate change official, and Ban Ki-moon impressed upon us after the last conference in Bonn that all of countries of the world which have claimed that they would take a leading role in this global policy to combat the climate crisis have fallen far short of doing what would actually be needed."
"If we take the European energy policy as a measure of what we as Europeans are actually willing to do, I do not believe that we can really regard the constantly competitive strategy that was so clearly employed in connection with the North Stream and Nabucco projects to be the starting point for a common future-oriented European energy policy."
"Why is this?"
"What are the reasons for this?"
"I believe that the criticism for this should not really be directed at you, Mr Fischer."
"The country which the chairman of my group, Mr Cohn-Bendit, visited carrying the European flag in his rucksack so that he could give it to the President was in reality weak."
"And unfortunately, Mr Barroso, even though there is often talk about your strength, where was this strength during the times of weakness of this Council Presidency?"
"We did not see any evidence of it."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - (CS) Prime Minister, Commission President, it is a great honour for me to be able to stand up today as the first speaker from the many new groupings of European conservatives and reformers and also as a Czech MEP talking about the Czech Presidency."
"However, I will be speaking as a Member of the European Parliament and not just from a narrow national perspective."
"At the same time, I will be speaking as a representative of my group and therefore I will take account of its political priorities."
"I have already had an opportunity to speak at the plenary session in January, when Czech Prime Minister Topolánek presented the priorities of the Czech Presidency here, and I am speaking today as Czech Prime Minister Fischer submits the report on what the Czech Republic has achieved."
"I do not mention this by chance."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Czech Government has succeeded in preserving both the political and the organisational continuity of the Presidency, despite the collapse of the Government, which was the result purely of internal political factors."
"I would like at this point to applaud the tone of the Prime Minister's speech, as it was exactly the tone of the Czech Presidency itself, matter-of-fact and results-orientated."
"In my opinion, some of the critical assessments were based on the subjective feelings of certain European representatives or media figures and have contributed nothing to our much-vaunted European cohesion, belonging instead to private political campaigns targeted at domestic audiences."
"I would now like to turn to the three priorities of the Czech Presidency."
"In relation to the economy I would like to emphasise again that the Czech Republic has succeeded in heading off an ominous wave of national protectionist measures which would have seriously undermined the fundamental values of European integration and particularly the principles of the unified single market."
"Concerning energy policy, the issue of secure and maintainable supplies for the energy sector proved to be a well chosen theme."
"In the first days of the Czech Presidency an imminent crisis over gas supplies was successfully warded off, bearing in mind of course that any real progress over this issue will require long-term strategic measures, including diversification of supply and liberalisation of the internal energy market."
"From the symbolic perspective of the other aim of EU foreign relations I would like to emphasise the summits with major global players, in other words the EU-US summit, which reaffirmed the fundamental importance of transatlantic relations, and also the EU-Russia summit and the EU-China summit."
"I would also like to stress the importance of the Eastern Partnership initiative and its implementation."
"In conclusion, I believe that the Czech Presidency can be summed up, on the whole, as providing proof that medium-sized countries and so-called new Member States can manage such a role with honour and to a high standard."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) I would like to say that the Czech Presidency was actually rescued by Mr Fischer's government and by Mr Fischer himself."
"I would like to emphasise that the Presidency coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the political changes which the media characterises as a liberation, but we have also had twenty years of unfulfilled promises, because levels of competence in the administration of public affairs have plummeted in the Czech Republic."
"I would also like to say that from this standpoint the government of Mr Fischer has been a pleasant surprise."
"He is a prime minister and a man who refuses to lie."
"His name first came to my attention when he was taking a stand against the falsification of statistical data in the Czech Republic."
"He is a man who avoids the grand phrases we have heard here under various presidencies, and who acts with deliberation."
"In my opinion it is a very good thing that such a man finally came to lead the Czech Presidency."
"As we are now marking the 500th anniversary of the birth of Calvin, who was born in France on 10 July 1509, I would like to say that the only thing that will truly save us in this difficult situation with two crises... (the President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the Czech Presidency has followed a depressingly familiar pattern: continuity, more of the same, the continuing obsession with climate change and the continuing drive to have new legislation."
"You said that under this Presidency legislation in 18 new areas had been worked on and you seem to be proud of that."
"I would have thought it is about time we took a couple of steps back and said that what we have in the European Union is an over-regulated model that is serving us very badly during the depths of a recession."
"And yet more status quo."
"You supported the idea of shooing in Mr Barroso without there being any sort of proper contest, but it is on the Lisbon Treaty that I was most interested."
"You ratified the Treaty through your own parliamentary chambers, without of course the thought of giving the people in your own country a referendum to express their opinion."
"But it is when it comes to Ireland that I really get interested."
"You said that you wanted there to be a credible policy for Ireland with their second referendum, and so you produced these guarantees, and here they are - guarantees on the right to life, on taxation, on security and defence."
"This document has no legal force whatsoever."
"It is not worth the paper that it is written on."
"You are the author of a disgraceful attempt to con the Irish into voting for this Lisbon Treaty in their forthcoming referendum."
"Of course you have been supported by Mr Barroso on that."
"He never respects the result of democratic referendums whether they are in France, the Netherlands or Ireland."
"He says we must ignore them, we must continue."
"It is all about power."
"It is all about him and the EU institutions getting more power at the expense of the Member States."
"I hope the Irish tell you all where to go in the second referendum on 2 October - and they just might!"
"(Mixed reactions)"
"However, I do not wish to be mean-spirited, because there was one wonderful, bright, uplifting moment during the Czech Presidency, a moment when all of us that believe in nation states, that believe in democracy, that believe genuinely in the rule of law could come into this Chamber and feel for the first time in my experience proud of the fact that we were part of this European Parliament."
"I am of course referring to the visit of Václav Klaus."
"What a wonderful speech that was: coming into this Chamber and telling a few home truths and pointing out that European parliamentarians and leaders are not listening to the peoples of Europe - at which 200 of you got up and walked out of the room."
"So at least for Václav Klaus we thank you very much for the last six months."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission. - Madam President, I should just like to put a question."
"I am not criticising, but is it allowed to have flags in the Chamber?"
"(Objections."
"Mr Farage held up a Union Flag.)"
"Because, if it is allowed, I should just like to put the European flag here today, if I may do so."
"(Mr Barroso placed a European flag on his desk."
"Applause.)"
"(DE) Madam President, in terms of European integration, it is without doubt a good thing that one of the new EU countries, in this case the Czech Republic, held the Council Presidency."
"Less welcome, however, was the chaos which the Presidency is partly responsible for leading us into."
"Of course, we could hardly expect perfection from a new country with little European experience, but we could at least expect a minimum degree of sensitivity."
"The arts scandal at the start of the Presidency could not have been blamed on the government in Prague, but the Council Presidency can be held fully responsible for its half-hearted response and the fact that the artworks remained on display."
"However, the Czech Presidency showed political leadership in particular when dealing with difficulties and in crisis management."
"In this regard in particular there were considerable shortcomings: a 20-day energy crisis in Europe during the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine could have been overcome in one way or another; management of the Middle East crisis was, in my opinion, more than a little clumsy."
"And if the US missile shield in the Czech Republic was not bad enough, dependence on the US was also reflected in the Presidency, for example in the way that the Israeli offensive in Gaza was trivialised as defensive action."
"Even the Treaty of Lisbon was only half-heartedly criticised and delayed by the Prague leadership."
"As a result, we missed an important opportunity to bring more democracy back into the European Union."
"The fact that ultimately no agreement could be reached between Slovenia and Croatia with regard to the sea borders is also extremely regrettable."
"After all, Croatia is no less prepared for accession to the EU than the ten new Member States were at the time of their accession."
"On the contrary, it may even be better prepared."
"Even more regrettable, in my opinion, is the fact that Sweden does not wish to continue the attempts at conciliation."
"Croatia does not deserve that."
"Overall, our conclusions about the success of the Czech Presidency are somewhat mixed."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to respond very briefly on behalf of the Council and the former Czech Presidency."
"Firstly - on a personal note - to be confronted with the atmosphere of a Parliament, whether the Czech Parliament or the European Parliament, is always a great lesson for a man who is essentially a specialist and who has strong academic leanings."
"It is a lesson in how different ideas can be at times concerning the speed and intensity of European integration, or the nature of the EU."
"All of this simply reflects the very broad spectrum of your views and I think it is part and parcel of true democracy."
"I would therefore like to thank you for expressing your views and ultimately also for the critical suggestions which you have presented here."
"As far as the speech of Mr Kósa is concerned, I do not wish to comment on it in detail, but I think it reflects the importance of our motto 'Europe without barriers' and I hope that the EU will continue to live up to this motto."
"I firmly believe that the measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the very severe economic and financial crisis were adequate and sensible at the time of their adoption."
"Criticisms have been levelled here at the pace of financial market regulation."
"We have adopted fundamental measures in this area and they were agreed on after a very serious, challenging and controversial debate, where we juggled with the details right up to the European Council in June, producing a result which perhaps did not satisfy everyone, as there are some who consider the world to be over-regulated."
"We are nevertheless ready for the Commission's draft legislative solutions to financial market regulation and banking supervision in a European format this autumn."
"The fact that there have been no manifestations of protectionism is - I repeat again - of fundamental importance, as is the fact that we have managed to agree on applying the principles of solidarity, especially towards certain countries where the economy has got into the greatest difficulties."
"I will be meeting with President Klaus this evening and I will convey to him the praises of the honourable Member."
"Otherwise, the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in the Czech Republic has of course proceeded fully in accordance with the Czech constitution."
"The treaty was ratified in both chambers of parliament and we await the signature of the President of the Republic."
"I hope it will be final, decisive and correct."
"The fact that no referendum was held in the Czech Republic to ratify the Treaty is entirely an internal matter for the Czech Republic and is a matter fully compatible and fully in conformity with the Czech constitution."
"This ends my digression into domestic affairs."
"I would like to thank the many speakers who praised the level of continuity achieved by the Czech Presidency."
"Personally I considered it a great challenge for my cabinet and for myself as well."
"It was a test for the new cabinet and for all of the ministers and the teams of specialists, and everyone passed the test with flying colours - as has already been pointed out in my own speech and in the appraisals of certain honourable Members."
"I regarded my one third share of the Presidency as a personal task and I am delighted that the Czech Presidency has carried if off with honour."
"(CS) Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am proud of the fact that the Czech Presidency will go down in the history of the EU as the model of an accommodating, professional, non-partisan and well prepared administration."
"In defiance of indiscriminate criticisms from the European media and the Czech opposition, the Czechs successfully managed to finalise agreements over dozens of legislative standards."
"The Czechs accomplished this at half time - before Parliament ended with the election period."
"The agreements covered, for example, roaming, the energy package and measures to combat the crisis."
"It was the Czechs who finally managed to crack the nut of introducing a lower VAT rate for labour-intensive services, which is a pro-growth and counter-crisis measure."
"The Czechs also managed not only to assist with the resumption of oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe, but also to reach agreement on the Nabucco southern gas pipeline and to prepare it for signing together with the Commission President."
"Unfortunately, the Czech Republic will also go down in EU history as an example of political instability, because the social democrat Paroubek placed his own ambitions above the interests of the EU and - together with several turncoats - engineered the downfall of the Czech Government half way through its successful Presidency."
"I would like to thank the teams of Prime Ministers Topolánek and Fischer as well as the Czech mission in Brussels for their hard work in furthering the interests of the EU and the Czech Republic."
"The teams showed that these interests are not mutually exclusive, even in times of crisis."
"In addition, they convinced the French President, among others, that protectionism is a dirty word."
"I would like to congratulate you and all of us for that."
"I would now like to call on the Swedish Presidency to begin talks immediately over the suspension of Canadian visas for Czech citizens."
"I believe that these talks will also be a success."
"After all, solidarity is the greatest strength of the European Union."
"(PT) Madam President, Prime Minister Fischer declared that the Czech Presidency was very successful."
"Mr Fischer, I regret to say that I do not agree."
"The Prime Minister will hold the least responsibility for this, but the Czech Presidency was not at all consensual."
"I would firstly mention the controversy about works of art, a controversy which was favourable to artists, but not to the Presidency."
"Then there was the domestic political instability, which tarnished the image of the European Union or, in other words, of all of us."
"Mr Fischer, it is true that the Czech Republic managed to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, but this is still missing the signature of President Václav Klaus, and we are all agreed that having a Euro-sceptic president while you are holding the Presidency of the European Union is no help at all."
"The Czech President sent out various signals of Euro-scepticism, primarily by refusing to use the EU flag."
"However, more important is his failure to sign the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is an act of disrespect towards all of us and towards the people of Europe."
"However, the Czech Presidency was particularly wrong on the directive on maternity leave."
"I know what I am talking about, because I was the rapporteur for this report."
"The Presidency's involvement in this issue was extremely negative and it was greatly assisted by Mrs Lulling, who boycotted the vote on my report."
"The Czech Presidency was against extending the duration of maternity leave to 20 weeks and it was against including paternity leave, which is essential to ensure that family responsibilities are shared between men and women and therefore to promote gender equality."
"Prime Minister, men are needed in the home just as much as women are needed in the labour market."
"Men have just as much right to see their children develop as women have to enjoy career success."
"Prime Minister, please do not devalue the rights of women or their skills."
"(GA) Madam President, an overwhelming number of people voted against the Treaty of Lisbon last year, because it was believed that a better Europe could be achieved: a Europe that is democratic and responsible; a Europe that promotes the rights of workers, that defends public services and that seeks a positive role in the world."
"We are told that the European Council has agreed a package of legally binding guarantees that address the concerns of the Irish people, but what has been published is just a clarification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It does not change in any way the body or the substance."
"When we vote on this matter in October, we will be voting on the exact same Treaty that was rejected last year - without any amendment, without any additional matter, without any deletion."
"The exact same Treaty of Lisbon that 53% of the voters rejected."
"We need a new Treaty for a new era."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Czech Presidency for its efforts, which can perhaps be interpreted precisely as a parable of the situation in which our institutions currently find themselves."
"We all recognise that the European Union is the only possible platform for tackling some of the major challenges we are facing."
"No one can think, for instance, that Malta on its own, or Italy with 5 000 km of coastline, can resolve the problems of immigration, just as so many other countries cannot resolve the problems linked to the supply of energy."
"However, it is precisely the affairs of the Czech Presidency - namely, contending with major internal difficulties, but also with a different interpretation of Europe - that give us a better understanding of what it is we are being asked to do."
"I have not brought any flags with me this morning, but I know this for sure: I distrust obtuse nationalism and I also distrust bureaucratic monsters that can rip the heart out of our political experience and make us forget what we are being asked to achieve."
"The truth is that we are paying the price for indecision."
"We are paying a tragic price for not having the courage to take certain decisions that, today, are momentous decisions, and this is perhaps also reflected in the fact that we do not have the strength right now to tackle the most immediate circumstances, which are those linked to the start of a very problematic new parliamentary term."
"However, I believe that we have a great opportunity."
"Some did better than others in these elections, but we all know for certain that we will be unable to rise to any challenges if we do not work together."
"I therefore believe that we must assume our responsibilities and give these institutions the strength to be able to reconnect with our citizens, because one thing is certain: what we are paying for most is the fact that we are paying in the first place, because this leads to the estrangement of our citizens, who are distancing themselves from our ideals."
"(CS) Prime Minister, Madam President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here in order to evaluate the previous Presidency."
"This Presidency had two faces."
"Let us not forget either of them, even if there are some things we would perhaps like to forget."
"Many people here complain that the Czech Presidency was not active enough in combating the financial crisis."
"Others recall the controversial parliamentary speech of President Klaus."
"Others yet complain about the tactless description of Barack Obama's crisis programme as a road to hell."
"However, the Czech Presidency was also connected with some definite progress."
"Let us recall, for instance, the environmental package and the progress over adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Czech Presidency had two faces and symbolically it had two premiers."
"Today the more successful of the two stands before you."
"Prime Minister, I would like to thank you and your government for the efforts you have made and I would like to thank the officials at European and Czech institutions for the work they have done."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand please for the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic."
"Madam President, this Parliament is dominated by a cynical grand coalition between the principal party of European capitalism, the EPP, and the Social Democrats masquerading as a left but in reality implementing the same neo-liberal agenda of forcing working people to pay for the current crisis of international capitalism."
"Now this grand coalition wants the Lisbon Treaty forced on the Irish people and the people of Europe because Lisbon represents the neo-liberal agenda - including attacks on workers' rights - and the enhancement of militarisation and the armaments industry."
"The so-called guarantees given to the Irish people change nothing, mean nothing and are irrelevant."
"As an Irish Socialist, I challenge this coalition."
"I challenge President Buzek, Mr Barroso, Mr Schulz, and Mr Verhofstadt: come to Ireland in September, debate with us in front of audiences of workers why they should support your Lisbon project, which is entirely hostile to their interests."
"(GA) Be prepared for a vigorous campaign against the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland."
"We will be speaking on behalf of the millions of Europeans who did not have a chance to vote against the Treaty of Lisbon, a Treaty that is not for the benefit of the majority of the people of Europe, but for the benefit of bureaucrats, of large corporations and of military industries."
"(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, during this debate many people have expressed their gratitude to the Czech Presidency for the fact that it has still managed to complete a few projects, in administrative terms, by the end of its term of office."
"I ask myself in all seriousness: have we really become so modest in our expectations?"
"We are in the business of politics."
"What we actually expect, in the greatest economic crisis for decades which is combined with environmental challenges, is a Presidency which shows leadership and vision."
"That is what we really expect."
"We have seen that the administrative work has been completed for what is still on the table at end of the term of office."
"I really would have expected more."
"Prime Minister, if you meet with President Klaus this evening, please tell him that had an opportunity during these six months to make the Czech national identity and sovereignty clear to Europe by showing strong leadership."
"He did of course promote the importance of national sovereignty here in Parliament."
"Unfortunately, he missed the opportunity."
"Mr President we have only a minute so I shall dispense with the pleasantries."
"I should like to defend your honour against one of my Irish colleagues, Joe Higgins."
"I would remind Mr Higgins that you, in your work in the Solidarity movement, defended workers and their rights, and I think the historical facts should be reflected it in this House."
"A little bit of controversy is no bad thing but it is quite extraordinary that this morning we have Nigel Farage on the one side and Sinn Féin and Joe Higgins on the other side - the extremes of the right and left -talking against the Lisbon Treaty."
"I think that should be a good enough reason for the rest of us to vote 'yes' to the Lisbon Treaty and for Irish voters, who will be making up their own minds on 2 October, to listen to the voices who are urging them to vote 'no' and to listen very carefully to judge what they stand for, and then to listen to the voices of reason and reflect on the fact that the European Union has been very good for Ireland and Ireland good for it, and that we will continue to remain at the heart of Europe by supporting this Treaty."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Fischer, Mr Barroso, your Presidency, Mr Fischer, shows, once again, how urgent it is for the European Union to have a stable presidency."
"Moreover, this is what the Treaty of Lisbon provides for."
"I have found you to be rather quiet, Mr Fischer, and I should like to know your opinion of the programme of the Troika, which your government signed in June 2008 with France and Sweden."
"We are also eager to hear about Sweden's work programme on this subject, and on three issues in particular: the Doha Programme, the Millennium Development Goals and the Union for the Mediterranean."
"What is your feeling, Mr Fischer, about this instrument and what is your assessment of the Troika, which is already the first sign of a stable presidency of the European Union?"
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the short, sharp exchange which took place between group leader Mr Farage and President Barroso was extremely enlightening from the perspective of Europe's future."
"It made it glaringly obvious that the ultimate destination of the course being mapped out by the Treaty of Lisbon was the abolition of the nation states, which also explains why President Barroso would have been annoyed at seeing a national flag in this Chamber."
"We share, of course, the same common European objective."
"But, in doing so, we want to make it clear that, instead of proclaiming the slogan given here, 'United in diversity', we want to strive for cooperation in diversity, which means that we are in favour of preserving the nation states."
"This is the framework within which we want to work for a single Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to state once again that, under conditions for which neither Prime Minister Topolánek nor Prime Minister Fischer was responsible, the Council Presidency was more successful than it appears to have been, and I would also like to thank Saša Vondra for preparing for this Presidency."
"I would like to make one further comment and that is in response to Mr Higgins."
"The Treaty of Lisbon contains a horizontal social clause."
"It gives us more social rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If we do not get this Treaty, we will have a Europe with fewer social rights."
"I believe that this should be made clear, so that the people of Ireland cannot be told any more lies."
"We should tell the truth."
"Without the Treaty of Lisbon we are left with the Treaty of Nice and with fewer social rights in Europe."
"We should therefore stop this awful campaign and tell the people of Ireland the truth."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to point out that the Czech Presidency has not only achieved more than it has been given credit for, but that it was also very varied."
"First-rate officials and outstanding ministers, such as Karel Schwarzenberg, Saša Vondra, Ondřej Liška and others, as well as Prime Minister Fischer have done an excellent job."
"I would like to thank them for that."
"This country has only one problem and that is President Klaus, who has seriously damaged his country by consciously and deliberately undermining this successful Presidency."
"I would like to thank Prime Minister Fischer for the masterful way in which he rejected this, went to the Brussels Summit himself and successfully concluded this Council Presidency."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this time my response really will be very brief."
"I would like to thank you for your contributions to the discussion."
"They have demonstrated once again the diversity of opinion and breadth of different ideas in Europe; how difficult and yet how necessary it is to look for some sort of common denominator and common voice."
"However, I believe that this diversity is invigorating for our continent and for the process of integration and that it belongs here."
"You will doubtless be carrying your positions, your analytical viewpoints and your assessments with you from this place and perhaps there is no scope for me to convince you otherwise, since this is not an academic debate."
"Both my government and - let it be said - the previous government really did everything possible to fulfil our programme and our agenda for the Presidency and we did it with great perseverance, regardless of the progress made by the Czech Republic in ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I would like to make that very clear."
"As far as the troika is concerned and the work of the troika involving France, the Czech Republic and Sweden, I value this mechanism highly."
"We were able to cooperate very closely on the day-to-day agendas."
"It is a mechanism which contributes enormously to the continuity and smooth handover of the Presidency and I appreciate it very much."
"As far as the ambitions of the Czech Presidency are concerned and the extent to which the Presidency was technocratic, showed leadership, was visionary or whatever - I am sure it began with a vision for the EU and with a programme and also that it succeeded in fulfilling that programme."
"It is up to you to judge the extent to which this was achieved."
"For my part, however, I remain firm in the belief that this was a Presidency which fulfilled its goals and ambitions, although there will always be some criticisms and some areas where - for whatever reason - we fell short."
"Once again, I would like to thank you for the debate and for the critical remarks, and I would like to thank all of you who showed understanding and appreciation, both on a political level and on a personal level. Once again, I wish you every success in your work."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, some concrete questions were raised."
"First of all, regarding the reintroduction of visa requirements for nationals of the Czech Republic travelling to Canada, the Commission regrets that Canada has reintroduced this visa requirement."
"I discussed this issue with the Canadian Prime Minister in the margins of the last G8 meeting."
"I expect this measure to be temporary and I hope that full visa travel between the Czech Republic and Canada will be established soon."
"I asked Commissioner Barrot to meet Czech officials to discuss this urgently, and I understand that the first meeting between Commission officials and Czech foreign affairs officials took place in Brussels yesterday."
"On that basis, the Commission will examine the situation carefully and will report on this in the visa reciprocity report that will be issued, probably, in September 2009."
"In cooperation with the Czech Government, we will consult the Canadian authorities in order to get more information on the reasons behind their decision and we will make all the necessary efforts to restore visa-free travel."
"Concerning the issue of the regulation and supervision of the financial market, which was also raised during the debate, of course there is still an agenda to complete, namely what was adopted at the European Council as a consensus based on the de Larosière report - a report I commissioned from that high-level group - but we also have to take note of the progress that has been made."
"The Commission proposals on capital requirements, deposit guarantees, credit-rating agencies and on the Solvency Directive for the insurance sector have all been adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council."
"The Commission has presented draft legislation on hedge funds and private equity, on securitisation and remuneration in the banking sector."
"It is now for the European Parliament and the Council to adopt them - if they agree - rapidly."
"Another point that was mentioned during the debate was the issue of resistance to protectionism."
"In fact, it was a very important topic at the 1 March European Council."
"During the last half of 2008 there was a dangerous drive for some protectionist internal measures in the European Union."
"I think it is fair to say that the Czech Presidency and many Member States made it clear that we cannot accept this kind of fragmentation of our internal market, so the discussion that took place during those months was also a very important development."
"Finally, concerning the critics of the parliamentary ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, let me tell you I cannot understand how someone who has been elected to a parliament can call into question the parliamentary ratification of a treaty."
"A parliament is the basis of democracy and ratification by parliament is as legitimate as a referendum."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to say once again to the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic: thank you very much for your presidency, for your summary and for your participation in the debate here today."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.35 and resumed at 10.40)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (PT) The world is facing one of the most serious crises of capitalism, with dramatic consequences for workers and people in general."
"In the EU, this crisis is the result of neoliberal policies which are still being pursued."
"These policies are enshrined in the Treaties and in the so-called 'Lisbon Strategy', which the Treaty of Lisbon is trying to institutionalise, with greater depth and scope."
"Instead of properly tackling the causes of the crisis, the Council is reiterating the fundamental lines of those policies which caused the crisis, in what constitutes a worrying and irresponsible attempt to continue with these policies despite all the evidence."
"As a result, the Council is supporting:"
"the intention to adopt the Treaty of Lisbon, now by means of deception, which involves passing off exactly the same thing, which has already been rejected by the Irish people, as something different;"
"free and unregulated movement of capital and the existence of offshore financial centres;"
"liberalisation of the markets, privatisation of public services and growing financialisation of the economy;"
"deregulation of labour relations, devaluation of wages, intensification of exploitation and defence of flexicurity;"
"the failure to properly tackle unemployment, by persisting in channelling huge sums to support the financial sector, without paying the same attention to the productive sectors."
"Presentation of the work programme of the Swedish Presidency (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on presentation of the work programme of the Swedish Presidency."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, honourable Members, allow me first to congratulate you on the election of your new president."
"I am looking forward to working with Jerzy Buzek during the Swedish Presidency - and of course also in the time thereafter."
"It is an honour for me to address the European Parliament as President-in-Office of the European Council."
"I know that approaching half of you have been elected to this assembly for the first time."
"Collectively, you all give a voice to 500 million Europeans."
"There are great expectations of you."
"I am addressing you during a challenging period."
"Rarely has the EU cooperation faced harsher tests and tests so varied in nature."
"In the short term we aim to ensure a smooth transition to a new treaty - the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Now and in the slightly longer term, we must continue to manage the economic and financial crisis."
"Under the surface is the threat of a growing climate crisis which, in the long term, is the greatest challenge we face."
"One thing is clear."
"If the Swedish Presidency is to succeed in the many challenges facing it, we must work alongside you - you who work at the heart of European democracy."
"We hope for your support and cooperation, and that you are prepared to take on the challenges together with us."
"When we talk of the history of the EU, we tend to maintain that the cooperation has created a foundation for peace in a Europe that has so often been characterised by the opposite."
"I would like to tell you that my grandfather was a Swedish soldier posted to the Norwegian border during the Second World War - a war in which Sweden was neutral."
"The nearest my grandfather got to the war was to occasionally get a glimpse of it - from a safe distance."
"For a long time, that was Sweden's relationship with Europe: observing from a distance."
"While Europe was left in ruins after the Second World War, Sweden was untouched."
"We were richer economically - but poor in terms of European community."
"Twenty years ago the barbed wire between Austria and Hungary was cut."
"The Berlin Wall came down, and Europe changed almost overnight."
"A number of countries then set out on the journey that resulted in representatives of 27 countries sitting in this room today."
"Sweden was one of these countries."
"If you are a late starter, you need time to catch up."
"In the late 1980s political commitment for Europe began to mature in Sweden."
"Slowly the realisation of Sweden's closeness to and dependence on Europe grew."
"Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt played a decisive role in the work on bringing Sweden into the European community - in other words, accepting openness, globalisation and free trade."
"He was driven by a firm conviction that Sweden belonged in Europe."
"Eighteen years ago we made our application for membership of the European Union."
"We had finally matured in our conviction that people's lives and our future could best be served by cooperation and community with others, that we had something to contribute - and that we had much to learn."
"We were no longer afraid of cooperating."
"We dared to be part of Europe."
"These years from the mid-1980s onwards, which were revolutionary for Sweden, ran in parallel with a deepening of my own political commitment."
"I had a strong yearning for Europe, as did many of my generation of Swedish politicians."
"I remember how as a young, newly elected member of the Swedish parliament I was invited to visit the European Parliament."
"It was a sign of Parliament's openness and accessibility - despite the fact that at that time Sweden was not a member of the Union."
"A few years later, in 1997, after Sweden had joined the Union, I was involved in putting together the PPE Group's youth organisation, Youth of EPP, and I myself became its first chairman."
"It enabled me to see how European cooperation worked in practice."
"Together we sought European solutions to European problems."
"We got to know not only each other, but also each other's history and culture."
"It enabled me to get to know the capital cities of Europe - and I can hardly count the number of churches I visited in Europe in the process."
"In 20 years Sweden has gone from observing at a distance to being an active part of the European cooperation."
"This has in turn had an effect on the Swedish population."
"Ten years ago, one in three Swedes thought EU membership was good for the country, but just as many thought the opposite."
"Today that has reversed."
"Nearly two in three Swedes believe that EU membership is good for Sweden."
"In the elections to the European Parliament in June, more that 45 per cent of Swedes turned out to vote."
"That is eight per cent more than in 2004, and it is above the average for Europe."
"Today Sweden is a country that appreciates and takes a positive view of EU membership."
"We woke up to it a bit late, but we have worked hard to catch up."
"That is a victory for all of us who believe in European cooperation."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, honourable Members, we are facing the question of the fate of our generation - a social problem which, unlike many others, is growing slowly - and only in the wrong direction."
"Our planet has a fever."
"Its temperature is rising - and it is up to us to react."
"The Greenland icecap is shrinking by more than 100 cubic kilometres every year."
"The icecap in the Western Antarctic is melting at an increasingly fast rate."
"We know that the shrinking Greenland ice alone could result in an increase in sea levels of up to two metres."
"The effects will be dramatic."
"If the sea level were to rise by just one metre around the world, a hundred million people would be forced to leave their homes in Asia alone."
"The most vulnerable are those in Bangladesh, eastern China and Vietnam."
"There would also be other serious consequences, however."
"The weather will change, with the risk that many species of flora and fauna could become extinct."
"This is the case even if we stay within the 2 °C target set by the UN, which was backed last week both by the G8 and by the Major Economies Forum in L'Aquila."
"Our climate is under threat from both our use of and our dependence on fossil fuels."
"That is the bad news."
"So what is the good news?"
"Although time is short, it is still on our side."
"We must act now, however."
"We already have everything in place to expand renewable energy and the technology to improve energy efficiency."
"According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than half of the measures required in order not to exceed the 2 °C target can be taken using the technology we already have."
"Moreover, measures to counter climate change have very useful side effects - effects which in themselves justify the measures."
"If we consume less energy, we will save money."
"We will improve public finances while at the same time households will have greater resources."
"If we invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency, we will improve our energy security."
"We will be less dependent on imports from countries that are sometimes both politically and economically unstable."
"Our investments in the green economy will create new job opportunities and drive growth in the decades ahead."
"Allow me to give a specific example."
"In January, many EU countries were affected by the gas crisis in Ukraine."
"Last week I spoke to President Yushchenko concerning how we can try to avoid a similar thing happening again."
"At the same time, it is important to be able to turn the viewpoint around."
"If Ukraine invested in energy efficiency so that the country reached the same level as the Czech Republic or Slovenia, the amount of energy saved would correspond to the entire country's gas imports for its own use from Russia."
"Ukraine could then become completely independent of gas imports from Russia and save a great deal of money besides - simply by improving its own energy efficiency."
"This is where we must seek the answers where the climate is concerned."
"(Applause)"
"Twelve years ago a coalition of the willing was formed in Kyoto."
"However, voluntary agreements are not enough."
"If we are to succeed in getting an international agreement on climate change in place, then the journey from Kyoto to Copenhagen must move from being a coalition of the willing to being everyone's responsibility."
"So how do we get there?"
"Europe must act together and collectively."
"We must show leadership and keep our promises."
"Europe is crucial to getting others to join an international agreement."
"All over the world we must set a price on emissions."
"We must start using national carbon taxes and emissions trading."
"The environmentally friendly alternatives will then emerge."
"If the price of using fossil fuels is set without regard to climate impact, global warming will continue."
"The alternatives will not emerge."
"Measures to increase energy efficiency will not become economically worthwhile."
"That is not enough, however."
"We need to have a wider answer to the question of 'how?'."
"It is not enough to limit emissions in a group of countries that voluntarily agree to reductions, but which together account for just 30 per cent of emissions."
"Neither is it sufficient to have solutions that are based only on restrictions in the most developed countries."
"Even if the so-called Annex I countries were to reduce their emissions to zero, the rapidly growing emissions of the developing countries would still take us above the 2 °C target."
"That is why we must discuss the financing of investments in the developing countries."
"We need to ensure rapid technology transfer and we need to make sure that the developing countries also make commitments to check the development for which they are currently heading."
"In addition, we will need clear commitments in the medium term for countries outside Europe too."
"The responsibility of the few must now become the responsibility of all."
"I know that the European Parliament will accept its responsibility."
"The Swedish Presidency sees you as our allies."
"We now want to write the story of how the climate threat was averted, and we want to write it together with you."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the economic and financial crisis spread like wildfire around the world within the space of a few weeks."
"Some people had given warnings, but for most people it came as a surprise - particularly its extent and depth."
"In a global world, problems also spread quickly to others."
"The force of the downturn is such that nobody has a miracle cure for getting out of it quickly."
"Coordinated action on the part of the EU is the best tool we have to meet the challenges of the crisis."
"Moreover, there is still much that can go wrong."
"In the circumstances, the EU has succeeded in showing leadership through these testing times."
"We agreed on guarantees and rules of the road for supporting the banks."
"We agreed on a common recovery plan to stimulate the economy."
"President Sarkozy and the French Presidency played an important part in this work, but I would also assert that the European Parliament was a driving force."
"Now we need to devote the autumn to discussing continued measures to take us through the crisis."
"The economic situation remains difficult, and public finances are now stretched in all the Member States."
"According to the Commission's forecasts, the deficit within the EU will exceed 80 per cent of GDP next year."
"We cannot close our eyes and pretend that it is not a problem."
"In the middle of all this we must not forget either that behind these figures are people who are concerned about their jobs and who are wondering how they will manage to pay for their homes and to maintain their standard of living."
"It is our task to answer them."
"When millions of Europeans lose their jobs and become excluded, our entire welfare comes under threat, and this at a time when our welfare is already under great pressure."
"We are living longer, while at the same time we are working less and having fewer children."
"If this trend continues, in 50 years' time there will be twice as many older people as children in Europe."
"So what can we do?"
"We must restore confidence in the financial markets."
"We must quickly get effective supervision in place to prevent similar crises occurring in the future."
"The Swedish Presidency will work towards agreement on this in the Council by the end of the year."
"We are hoping for your help in achieving this quickly and conclusively."
"Our citizens will not accept the repeated use of tax revenues to rescue financial institutions that have acted irresponsibly."
"We must rapidly get ourselves out of the growing public deficits through a coordinated exit strategy and a gradual return to the rules of the Stability Pact."
"Otherwise, short-term imbalances will be followed by chronic deficits."
"Large cuts await us, as are already a reality in parts of the EU; and we have previous experience of this in Sweden."
"Mass unemployment, social unrest and growing tax pressure then await us."
"We must ensure a social dimension to European policy that is based on healthy public finances and on getting more people into the labour market."
"This is by far the best way to safeguard our welfare system."
"I know that this is an important matter not least here in the European Parliament."
"It is unsustainable for three out of 10 Europeans of working age to be excluded from the labour market."
"Our aim must be an active labour market policy that, together with well-functioning social security systems, is able to manage change effectively."
"We must strengthen the individual's employability and ability to assert him- or herself in the labour market."
"In addition, we must activate and reactivate the unemployed."
"With more people in work there will be more support available for those who are not."
"We must also concentrate on reforms, modernisation and adaptation to a new reality."
"The world outside the EU is not standing still."
"It is moving forward at a tremendous rate."
"That is something we should acknowledge and accept."
"A review of the EU's Lisbon strategy could contribute to a necessary reform agenda."
"We will initiate this discussion in the autumn."
"In the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism."
"The WTO confirms that the number of trade-restricting measures has increased considerably in the past three months."
"Consequently, I welcome the L'Aquila agreement on restarting the Doha round - in order to ensure that the countries of the world again take the free trade-friendly path that we know benefits us all in the long run."
"The objective must be an EU that comes out of this crisis stronger."
"Mr President, honourable Members, when I travel around Sweden and talk about EU cooperation, I get few questions about the institutions of the EU."
"The questions instead tend to concern curved cucumbers, snuff and other everyday matters."
"Nonetheless, the institutional framework is important because it defines what we can do and in which areas."
"That is why the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is so central."
"The Treaty will make the EU more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more influential in the international arena."
"Most important of all, however, is the fact that having the Treaty of Lisbon in place will close the chapter on an inward-looking phase of EU cooperation."
"It is now time for the EU to look outwards and forwards."
"The Swedish Presidency is prepared to carry out all the preparatory work to ensure a smooth transition to a new Treaty, but naturally that requires the Treaty to have been ratified by all the Member States."
"Let us hope that that becomes a reality in the months ahead."
"International criminality is growing ever stronger."
"Criminal networks no longer see their activities bounded by national borders."
"We can see how the drugs trade and human trafficking are spreading."
"This is a threat to our democratic values and a threat to our citizens."
"At the same time, the freedom to move freely across borders is fundamental to our community - to study, work and live in another EU country."
"New times call for new answers, however."
"Consequently, this autumn we will draw up a new programme in this area that we will call the Stockholm Programme."
"The Stockholm Programme will sharpen the instruments that create security in the EU and that fight organised crime and terrorism."
"At the same time, we will create a better balance between these instruments and the measures that ensure legal certainty and that protect the rights of individuals."
"It will also ensure that those seeking asylum in the EU face a common, legally certain system - with greater consistency in the way they are received and the way their case for asylum is examined and greater consistency as regards repatriation policy."
"The dream of a future in Europe is a strong one for many people."
"At the same time, the population of Europe is getting older and older."
"A flexible system for labour immigration could bring together these two realities."
"Mr President, honourable Members, just over 50 years ago six countries laid the foundation for European cooperation."
"There are now 27 of us."
"We have grown in strength and influence, and we have grown in prosperity and diversity."
"Europe has been enriched."
"As a result, we are also better equipped both to exploit the opportunities presented by globalisation and to meet its challenges."
"Together we are strong."
"We talk of membership 'negotiations'."
"In the final event, however, membership is about sharing common values and following common rules."
"This is currently being pondered on by those that remain outside - from Reykjavik to Ankara via the western Balkans."
"The two leaders on Cyprus are facing a historical opportunity to agree a solution that will reunite the island that has been divided for far too long."
"For those inside, there is a temptation to allow the membership process to become an opportunity to resolve long drawn out disputes."
"In such cases we must find solutions that benefit both sides and open up the way ahead."
"Otherwise we jeopardise our progress towards our aim of continued European integration."
"The Swedish Presidency will work to advance the enlargement process in accordance with the commitments made by the EU, and strictly on the basis of the applicable criteria."
"We will act as an 'honest broker'."
"Mr President, honourable Members, with strength and influence comes an international responsibility that we are still striving to shoulder."
"It is accompanied by a duty to use this responsibility in everyone's best interest."
"The EU must work for peace, freedom, democracy and human rights."
"We have a responsibility to support the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world, a responsibility to live up to the UN's Millennium Development Goals."
"We also have a responsibility to support the work of the UN in other areas, to work together with our strategic partners, to become involved in the world's crisis hotspots - whether it is the peace process in the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea or the great challenges on the African continent."
"However, we also have a responsibility for regional initiatives such as the Mediterranean Union and the eastern partnership that are creating stability and cooperation between neighbouring countries with different circumstances."
"I am particularly grateful for the European Parliament's driving role where the Baltic Sea cooperation is concerned."
"Parliament presented a draft strategy for the region back in 2005."
"We now hope that this initiative can be crowned with the adoption of a Baltic Sea Strategy at the European Council meeting in October."
"The conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s became the starting point for the EU's involvement as crisis manager - an involvement that is now continually growing."
"Today the EU is involved in 10 or so crisis initiatives around the world."
"These days the world's problems come knocking on the EU's door."
"All around our world - and not least in the areas closest to us - many people's hope for their own development is linked to our cooperation."
"Let us together meet their expectations."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, honourable Members, as a result of European cooperation, today our continent lives in peace and prosperity, in freedom and stability."
"We have open borders and a social model that combines a market economy with consideration for each other."
"This is our shared Europe."
"Our citizens also want to know, however, that Europe is borne by ideas for the future and that our cooperation not only has a historical purpose but is also forward-looking."
"That is why we, as their elected representatives, have a responsibility to say what we want to do with Europe."
"Let me tell you how I see the Europe of the future."
"I want to see a Europe that acts forcefully for democracy, peace, freedom and human rights in the international arena and which dares to act on the foreign policy stage."
"For there are those among us with experience of what it is like to live without democracy and freedom, which gives us the credibility to act."
"I want to see a Europe that takes the lead in the fight against climate threats, which resists the temptation to compete on the basis of an industry that does not pay for the emissions that are destroying our climate and which provides incentives that make green technology worthwhile, so that our children and our children's children get to experience nature as we know it."
"I want to see a Europe that takes responsibility for the economy."
"'Lending for spending' cannot be the only motto."
"Neither can it be the case that 'profits are private and losses national'."
"Let us build up our public finances again, regulate sound financial markets, and secure the economic reforms that we need for growth and for industry that will continue to be competitive in the future."
"I want to see a Europe that develops its social model further, a Europe that combines a well-functioning welfare system with growth - with social cohesion, a Europe that through work, enterprise and healthy public finances creates room to maintain and develop our welfare models, in the best interests of all our citizens."
"I want to see a Europe that does not allow itself to be lured by the short-term crusades of protectionism, a Europe that safeguards the internal market that formed the basis of our EU cooperation and that allows goods and services to flow freely across our borders, for the benefit of ourselves and of the rest of the world."
"I want to see a Europe that is humbled by inequalities, that is open to the arguments of others and that has a strong will to find compromises, all to serve the common interest."
"Such a Europe will be strong whatever the times."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is an honour for me to stand here with you and represent European democracy."
"Many people have said to me that this will be the most difficult presidency for many years."
"There are many challenges, and we must prepare for the unexpected."
"Many ask whether a country the size of Sweden can shoulder this responsibility."
"Not alone - but together we can face these challenges."
"Let us do so with vision and drive, with initiative and courage."
"Europe needs it."
"The people of Europe need it."
"The European project is about the dream of solving people's problems together."
"This dream makes Europe strong."
"This year, 2009, is a fateful year for European cooperation."
"We have the chance to take the next step."
"The Swedish Presidency is ready to take on the challenge."
"Let us take it on together!"
"(Loud applause)"
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, these are no ordinary times and this will be no ordinary presidency."
"In addition to the usual legislative work, the Swedish Presidency will have other kinds of highly political challenges to deal with, and no one better to tackle these challenges than Prime Minister Reinfeldt and the Swedish Presidency team."
"Today I want to highlight two of the biggest policy challenges facing the European Union in the next six months: dealing with the economic crisis and negotiating an ambitious international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen."
"The worst financial and economic crisis in living memory continues to have devastating effects within our communities and families, with unemployment in particular continuing to rise."
"Getting the economy back on track remains the top priority."
"The European Union's collective action has led to an unprecedented fiscal effort that is producing concrete results."
"We have also shown solidarity amongst Member States, for instance by doubling the ceiling for balance of payments support for non-eurozone Member States to EUR 50 billion."
"We now need to fully implement the recovery package in all its aspects and make sure it translates into the creation of jobs and the promotion of economic activity on the ground."
"I believe it is essential to prioritise measures that limit unemployment and get people back to work."
"Here we can build on the results of the employment summit held in May as part of a Commission initiative with the Czech, Swedish and Spanish Presidencies."
"We need to put into practice the shared commitment to youth and to employment."
"Of course, responsibility for labour market policies lies with Member States, but we can and should use existing European instruments to help Member States keep people in employment and train them for the jobs of the future."
"That is why the European Commission is about to make a proposal to simplify Structural Fund procedures and waive the need for national cofinancing from the European Social Fund for 2009 and 2010."
"We will also redeploy resources in order to fund a new microcredit facility for employment and social inclusion."
"I hope this Parliament will support these proposals."
"The Commission proposals building on the de Larosière report I commissioned last October will form the basis for strengthened financial market supervision and regulation."
"With the proposals already made - many of them already approved by this Parliament and by the Council, some still in our decision-making process - we are indeed taking the lead globally in the reform of the financial international system."
"We will continue to do so, I am sure, at the G20 in Pittsburgh in September."
"Moving all these dossiers forward over the next six months is essential to build a new economy, because - let us make no mistake - the post-crisis economy cannot and will not be the same as the pre-crisis economy."
"We need to rebuild our economic model and put the values back at the heart of our social market economy, where they belong."
"We need to build an economy and a society based on opportunity, responsibility and solidarity, an economy which will have to reinvent new sources of growth because we cannot rely for ever on monetary and fiscal stimulus; a Europe of open and well-performing markets; a Europe of smart, green growth; a Europe with more effective regulation and supervision of financial markets; a Europe that deepens its single market and uses its potential to the full; a Europe that resists the trends for fragmentation or protectionism."
"Concerning climate change, Europe is already the first region in the world to implement far-reaching, legally binding climate and energy targets."
"I am proud of the way the Commission worked with the last Parliament and the Council to put this legislation in place, and I want to work closely with you and the Presidency in the run-up to Copenhagen."
"Our leadership role was very much appreciated in the meetings last week in L'Aquila in the G8, and in the Major Economies Forum."
"You will have heard about the progress made at these meetings."
"For the first time, all participants committed to capping the temperature increase at 2°C to respect climate science."
"This is certainly a welcome step forward, but we should not delude ourselves: our ambition and our commitment are not yet matched by others."
"Europe is far ahead of the curve in relation to the rest of the world and, frankly, 145 days from Copenhagen, that worries me."
"In the coming weeks we will step up our work with international partners to secure clear commitments in Copenhagen."
"We also need to make progress on the necessary means to support developing countries and boost technology transfer."
"In September the Commission will put its proposals for financing on the table so that we can build a European consensus and negotiate with others."
"The climate change agenda is, of course, closely linked with another priority: energy security."
"Today, the Commission will adopt proposals to strengthen our rules governing the security of gas supply and reinforcing solidarity between Member States, which I trust the Swedish Presidency will take forward with your support."
"These are the headline priorities - and rightly so."
"But there is plenty of other important work to be done over the next six months."
"Let me just flag the Stockholm programme, where the Commission has recently tabled an ambitious vision putting the citizen at the heart of our justice, freedom and security policy, balancing security with the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"For most of this decade the European Union has been engaged in internal institutional debates."
"Changes to our governing Treaty are absolutely necessary to equip the enlarged European Union to work democratically and effectively."
"I hope that we will see the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty in the coming months so that we can put its provisions to work and so that we can move on with the policy agenda I have just outlined."
"It is important to discuss procedure, but I believe it is even more important to discuss substance."
"The Swedish Presidency, as well as the next Spanish Presidency, will have to oversee - hopefully - a complex transition to the new Treaty in which the Commission and Parliament will have to play their full part."
"The European Union has constantly reinvented itself, from the initial vocation of healing a war-torn continent to the building of the internal market and then on to the reunification of Europe."
"During these last 50 years Europe has consistently exceeded expectations, confounding doubts."
"I am sure that we will also rise to the new challenge we face: laying the foundations for the smart, green economy of the future."
"We will succeed if we respect the key lesson from half a century of European integration: the European Union advances when all its parts cooperate in a spirit of openness, trust and partnership."
"The Swedish Presidency programme recognises this; the European Commission stands ready to play its part and so, I am sure, does this Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I do not usually address you, but for the first time today, I am going to devote one minute to you."
"Firstly, Mr Buzek, I salute you as a man of resistance and as one of the founders of Solidarność, as the man from Silesia who never forgot his roots, his history or his values."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is also proud to have convinced the vast majority of MEPs from all political backgrounds - Mr Schulz included - to make you the spokesman for 500 million citizens."
"Yes, Mr President, your election is the symbol of this open Europe, of this tolerant Europe, of this political Europe championed by the PPE Group and by the majority of our fellow Members here present."
"President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, what we expect of you is that you will make action the dominant theme of the Swedish Presidency over the next six months - in other words, faced with the twin challenge of the economy and climate change, we are saying that we need to do more, and faster, in order to come out of the crisis, by bringing our social market economy model fully into operation."
"I firmly believe that it is the vitality of the economy and that alone that will enable us to conduct the true social policy that we need."
"If we want a recovery and if we want it to come from Europe and not from Asia, as is anticipated, then we absolutely must speed things up today."
"When the crisis ends, the winners will be those who gambled on innovation, on training - in short, on action."
"In this regard, the PPE Group proposes, among other things, to increase the support given to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are key to maintaining and creating jobs."
"Furthermore, the economic crisis - I would insist on this point - requires not a national response but a European response."
"Moreover, our fellow citizens are convinced of this, one need only look at the opinion polls in the various countries: more than 66% of Germans and more than 70% of Europeans are convinced."
"To do more, and faster, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, that is also what the PPE Group expects of you where the fight against global warming is concerned."
"It is the responsibility of Europe, under your leadership, to lead the world in this action, which everyone here recognises as being urgent and a priority."
"And what better opportunity to act and to speed things up than the climate-change conference to be held in December in Copenhagen, in other words, on our own territory!"
"On the issue of climate change, Europe has proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that it can take action when it wants to."
"The task now is to capitalise on this, to make the other world powers join us."
"I am of course thinking of the United States, which must turn its words into deeds, but I am also thinking of the emerging countries, be it China, India or Brazil, which can no longer ignore the fact that they are heavily responsible for global warming."
"We shall therefore judge the Swedish Presidency on the ways in which it copes with the crisis and in the light of its results regarding the environment."
"I shall conclude by saying that, in order to act strongly on these two fronts, Europe must be equipped with appropriate institutions."
"The last year has shown us that, with the same treaty and with the same outdated principle of unanimity, it was possible to make progress with Europe but that it was also possible to reach a deadlock."
"It is a question of political will, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso."
"Speed things up: that is what the PPE Group is asking you to do over the next six months, and we have faith in the Swedish Presidency."
"Speed things up: that is what Europeans asked for in electing this Parliament and that is what we must give them if, in five years' time, we wish to see more of them turn out to vote."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency comes at a time of new beginnings for the institutions."
"It is not only this Parliament that is starting anew;"
"Europe is in a period of transition between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon, and - as we all know - it is a time of uncertainty in which we nevertheless need clarity with regard to economic, financial, labour market and climate policy decisions in the European Union and its Member States."
"You have talked about this and I agree with much of what you said."
"Climate change is, of course, the most important issue and you have given it the right level of priority."
"It is, of course, also the case that the jobs crisis requires an immediate and relevant solution."
"Therefore, we ask you during your Presidency to urge the Member States to take the investment plans and the economic recovery plans more seriously than they have done so far."
"What we need above all is the safeguarding of jobs - now, not next year, as the threat to jobs is present here and now."
"Job security is vital for the internal stability of society."
"We therefore expect you to give the utmost priority to jobs and job security in whatever form, for example by combining environmental protection and industrial policy, which is a highly intelligent solution."
"On the subject of job security, I would like to say this to you, Mr Reinfeldt: what seriously jeopardises jobs in Europe and is an even greater threat to social cohesion is the case law of the European Court of Justice."
"As you have just said, you travel a lot in Sweden and in Europe."
"So do we and what we hear from our citizens is that they do not want a Europe where companies move from country to country cutting wage levels."
"We therefore need initiatives from the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"We need these initiatives as a consequence of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in the Laval, Viking, Rüffert and Luxemburg cases."
"These are measures that you - and you in particular, because Sweden is affected by this misguided policy, this misguided case law - need to tackle during your Presidency."
"You also need to deal with another institutional issue, namely that of how the next Commission will be appointed."
"In this regard, I have to say that to some extent I get the general impression that not only you, but also all of your colleagues in the Council have been affected by the new institutional beginnings and the uncertainty about which Treaty we should actually be using as the basis for our actions, and that no one really knows where we are."
"It is a little bit like Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking in her Villa Villekulla - I will make the world the way I want it to be."
"Wonderful!"
"If we appoint the President of the Commission on the basis of the Treaty of Nice, we will have 20 commissioners."
"In that case, I would like to know which country will have no commissioner."
"To this, the Council will naturally say 'no, we certainly do not want to start a bloodbath behind closed doors."
"So, we have a wonderful solution - we will nominate the commissioner initially on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"It will take a couple of months for the Commission to be set up and by then the people of Ireland will have voted and we will have the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Then we can vote on everything else on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Great!'"
"We are a community based on law - or at least that is what I thought until now - in which the basis is the law in force."
"The law in force is the Treaty of Nice."
"Incidentally, there is someone who, as guardian of the Treaties, must first of all clarify which legal basis is to be used."
"That is the President of the Commission, but I have not heard a word from him on this matter."
"I would therefore like to state very clearly what we are expecting. My proposal, Prime Minister, was that you should not take the formalisation decision straight away, but first send your candidate to Parliament so that he can tell us what he wants to do to restore the economy, safeguard jobs, combat climate change, introduce an employment pact, an initiative for a public services directive and an initiative to improve the Posting of Workers Directive and establish a guarantee between the Commission and Parliament regarding an evaluation of the social consequences of the Commission initiatives."
"We could have already discussed everything with the candidate weeks ago to see whether he would receive a majority vote in this House on the basis of his proposals."
"Then you could have made a decision regarding formalisation."
"However, you took a different route."
"You said 'no we will take the formalisation decision first and then send the candidate'."
"I fear that this was another error and I also fear that this candidate, unless he makes a considerable effort, will not receive a majority vote in this House."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to make this very clear so that what will probably be the biggest contentious issue during your Presidency is perfectly clear between us right from the start."
"We expect institutional clarity, we expect socio-political commitment, and I believe that we will be with you with regard to climate policy."
"Mr President, just for you I have kept to my speaking time exactly."
"You will see that in a few seconds my six minutes will be up."
"You will not need to reprimand me - I knew that that was what you intended to do and I did not want to give you that pleasure."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, firstly I should like to say to Mr Reinfeldt that our Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will fully support the priorities of the Swedish Presidency, that is to say, the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we naturally expect to be implemented quickly and in full; the preparation for the climate-change summit in Copenhagen, which has already been mentioned and which is a priority that we fully support; and, lastly, the Stockholm Agenda."
"Furthermore, and this is the subject of my speech, Mr Reinfeldt, I should like to refer to an issue that is addressed in every speech in this House - the fight against the economic and financial crisis - in order to say to you that you are assuming the leadership of the European Council at a very precise moment in time."
"It is a good thing that it is Sweden that is chairing the Council because you have specific experience in this area."
"In the 1990s Sweden experienced exactly the same economic crisis that we are experiencing now throughout Europe and the world."
"You have experienced a crisis in the real estate sector."
"In the 1990s you also experienced a financial crisis, and you resolved all these problems by directly tackling the problems in the financial sector."
"My message to you is that you must act in exactly the same way today at European level because that is what we are lacking."
"We are trying to combat the economic and financial crises using 27 different approaches in the various countries, and that will never work."
"We expect you, Mr Reinfeldt, to use the experience you gained in Sweden, because it was a success, unlike in Japan, which has been economically stagnant for a long time."
"Sweden came out of the crisis because you immediately tackled the problems in the financial sector, something which is not being done for the time being in Europe."
"The thinking is that the United Kingdom can nationalise the banks while others - France, in particular - can recapitalise them."
"In Germany, work is under way to create 'bad banks'; in the Benelux countries a bit of everything is being done at the same time."
"The result is that there is no single approach."
"The United States is stabilising its banks and eliminating the toxic products while we continue to have problems."
"My request to you, therefore, is to take advantage of your experience in order to present a single rescue plan for Europe's financial sector, which will form the basis of the economic recovery."
"Without it, there will never be an economic recovery; the banks will not starting lending money again, and so on."
"This must be your absolute priority."
"The second point is that we hope that you, together with the Commission, can also present a new recovery plan, because 27 different recovery plans will not produce the necessary results in the coming years."
"It is absolutely essential that the Council and the Commission together take the lead in this."
"I know there are now 27 recovery plans at national level, but we see a number of protectionist measures inside those national plans."
"It is your responsibility, Mr Reinfeldt, to say to your colleagues that a better way to deal with this is, together with the Commission, to devise one single recovery plan and to invest in sustainable energy and in the new economy."
"I think that, with your experience in Sweden during the 1990s, you are the right man in the right place to do what we have not done so far: devise a single strategy in the European Union to combat this economic and financial crisis."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Reinfeldt, Mr Barroso, my fellow Member Mr Schulz said everything there is to say about the institutional concerns that my group has had for a long time with regard to the forthcoming election of the President of the Commission."
"We agree with what he said."
"We want the whole of the Commission and all of the top-level staff of the European Union to be elected according to the conditions of the Treaty of Lisbon and we will not give an inch on that."
"However, Mr Barroso, I would like to take the opportunity to explain the political reasons behind my group's doubts and its belief that you are not capable from a political point of view of doing what we feel to be necessary in the current situation in Europe."
"Take, for example, the frequently mentioned need for the new regulation of financial markets."
"We have had G8 summits, G20 summits, extended G8 summits, European summits."
"How far have we come?"
"If we look at the picture today and draw a comparison with the game of Monopoly that we are all familiar with, the banks have been re-established, they have passed 'go' and did not go to jail, they have taken hundreds of millions with public approval and then simply started the game again."
"I do not think that people are being doom-mongers when they say that as a result of this the next crash is inevitable."
"Mr Barroso, what happened to your forceful intervention?"
"Where are your genuine results?"
"We have seen no evidence of them."
"(Applause)"
"As regards climate policy, you know that during our entire European campaign we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have advocated the Green New Deal."
"We are absolutely convinced that it is utterly wrong to do what you have repeatedly done in the last five years, Mr Barroso, and that is to play economic strategies off against environmental and climate strategies."
"We believe this to be very much rooted in the past and it must stop."
"We need to think about economic development in a sustainable way and we must bring climate protection targets into line with environmental targets."
"That will benefit the economy and will create hundreds of thousands or even millions of jobs."
"Mr Piebalgs has demonstrated once again that this is the case in the energy sector in his study over recent months."
"In our experience, Mr Barroso, you are not in a position to set forth this Green New Deal."
"In summary, I can only say that, with regard to climate protection, Europeans have been conspicuous on the international stage in recent months as a result of their new-found hesitation - how far do we really want to go with the reduction targets? - and new tight-fistedness, and that, unfortunately, also applies to Sweden."
"The establishment of the International Climate Protection Fund for the poorer countries has gone extremely badly."
"The fact that it is still a secret that the Swedes want to take money from the development pots, for example, to put into this climate protection pot - that is a zero sum game and, from the point of view of the poorer countries, it is totally unacceptable."
"We must quickly put an end to this new tight-fistedness and new hesitancy in the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, Mr Reinfeldt, I can say something positive."
"We are prepared to tussle with you over the new definition of the Lisbon strategy and to work with you on this."
"You have said you will do this by the end of the year."
"We will help you in this. We will also support you if you wish to do more with regard to Eastern Europe and Russia, but the focus on a genuine climate policy must not merely be a matter of headlines, it must also be corrected in the small print of the Swedish programme."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like first of all to offer my sincere congratulations on yesterday's election, the election of a splendid president - the new head of Parliament."
"I do this, as you very well know, Mr President, as a Polish politician, but also as a person."
"You know that it was thanks to you that I met my wife, and that is still the greatest achievement of my life."
"Congratulations, and I wish you much success in your work."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists Group listened carefully to your speech, Prime Minister, and I am glad to be able to say that we share your views on very many matters."
"I consider your announcement of active measures to tackle the crisis to be especially important."
"The economic crisis, which is the worst crisis our civilisation has experienced since the 1930s, is causing unjustified anxiety throughout Europe - in poorer countries and in richer, in countries of the north and of the south."
"I am glad that you have announced an active fight against this crisis, and I am glad that you can see priorities which we also share - more freedom for the market, less regulation, more economic freedom, greater openness to free trade."
"These are a recipe for the economic growth of our continent, of our European Union."
"Prime Minister, we also share your conviction that dealing with climate change is an important matter."
"I know that you have bold views on this subject, and I want to encourage you to be bold in this area."
"The issue of climate change shows very clearly that today we live not only in a single Europe, but in a single world, where the threats are shared by all and must be dealt with effectively."
"I am very glad that you referred to the fight against crime as a serious problem of our European Union."
"I am convinced that, because Sweden is already a powerful force in the area of crime novels, we will also achieve success under your leadership in the area of the fight against crime."
"It is extremely important, and I am glad that both you and your Minister for Foreign Affairs have mentioned recently that you want to look carefully at our neighbours and take what I hope will be a sympathetic view of the idea of enlargement of the EU."
"We must not forget that across the eastern borders of the EU there are countries which are entitled to be part of the area of democracy and affluence which we are in today."
"I regret to say that there is just one point on which my group is not in agreement with you."
"This is the question of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"You spoke about democracy in the context of the Treaty of Lisbon - and you were right to do so."
"It should be remembered that it was in a democratic referendum that the people of Ireland rejected the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Since we have respect for democracy, we should respect the vote of the Irish people."
"Prime Minister, I hope that your priorities, which in very large measure are shared by the ECR Group, will prove to be an opportunity which enables you to lead the European Union effectively and to deal effectively with the crisis, which is today our greatest problem."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Swedish Presidency has presented an ambitious work programme which includes a proposal for more transparency."
"Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing."
"Many people believe that the crisis has been caused far away in the US and by some bankers who are said to be greedy."
"The heads of government in the EU Member States seem not to have had anything to do with the crisis."
"They are innocent parties."
"Those who bask in innocence do nothing to combat the crisis."
"I believe that transparency should also include talking about the failures of policy that contributed to the crisis and also of course about the bankers."
"Transparency is in vogue in casino capitalism."
"We are keen to see what happens with the Baltic Sea Strategy and I would be behind the President-in-Office of the Council if he were to focus on dialogue with Russia."
"We would also like the European Union to support the pledges of President Obama and President Medvedev with regard to the dismantling of nuclear weapons."
"The European Union ought to take advantage of this new opportunity for disarmament."
"The Swedish Presidency wants to further harmonise asylum law and make the European Union more attractive to migrant workers."
"Asylum policy is to be closely linked to development policy."
"This is a good thing in our view, but at the rigorously guarded external borders of the European Union, particularly in the Mediterranean, thousands of people die every year when seeking sanctuary from persecution, poverty, natural disasters and wars."
"Despite costly border control, monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place."
"The Swedish Presidency is focussing on more inclusive labour markets to create full employment and therefore wants to initiate labour market reforms and gender equality measures."
"We too are in favour of a strategy for good work practices which will support wage increases and introduce a statutory minimum wage across the board in all 27 countries."
"We want to see the EU agree on targets for the minimum wage set at a level of at least 60% of the national average wage in order to prevent people falling into poverty despite having gainful employment."
"I particularly welcome what you said about Cyprus and I wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated the fact that the Swedish Presidency emphasised issues that concern our fellow citizens, our electorate, namely the environment and climate change, the financial crisis, the safeguarding of jobs and the fight against crime, because, in order to do a good job, we need to be in harmony with those who voted for us."
"We are no better or worse than our electorate, but I do believe that it is important to act in accordance with what they are asking of us, and these points seem to me to be along the lines that I mentioned."
"Moving on, we must, of course, turn the proposals into concrete action, and here we will come up against one another above all in the codecision procedure, since we, Parliament, and you, the Council, will lay down those rules that will govern the lives, affairs and interests of our electorate, and I believe that that is our fundamental task as legislators."
"We must overcome the crisis of confidence that undoubtedly exists."
"The poor turnout at the elections of this Parliament is a symptom of this, and to overcome it, we must act fully in accordance with the will of our electorate."
"We must also perhaps avoid making comparisons: your country borders Norway;"
"They are outside the European Union, but they live well all the same; they have the same problems, but they are no worse off than us, and here it is important to see and to demonstrate that it is worth having the European Union."
"I believe that this is a great challenge but I also believe that, with everyone's help, we can show that Europe should not be suffered, but should be an opportunity for those who live there and are citizens of it."
"(NL) The Dutch Party for Freedom has come into this Parliament in order to stand up for Dutch citizens and in order to wrest back the money that has been overpaid by the Netherlands to this cash-guzzling and bureaucratic Europe."
"The Party for Freedom was elected to this Parliament by Dutch voters to make it clear that Dutch citizens believe that the enlargement of the European Union has already gone far too far."
"Mr President, this Parliament spends its time regulating matters that should be determined in the Member States themselves."
"As far as our party is concerned, the European Union should only be involved in matters relating to economic and monetary cooperation."
"It is with Dutch interests to the fore that we will keep our eyes on the Swedish Presidency, as it is doing nothing for Dutch citizens."
"You want to just press ahead with the European Constitution, which Dutch voters rejected and which is 99% identical to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"You also fail to do anything about the immensely costly monthly relocation from Brussels to Strasbourg."
"What is more, you have not even put the matter on the agenda."
"Why not?"
"It costs thousands of millions of euros and the only people who like the idea are perhaps those at Ikea, who get the chance to sell moving boxes and extra cupboards."
"We also want to see the negotiations with Turkey brought to an immediate end."
"Turkey is an Islamic country and the Islamic ideology is completely at odds with our Western culture."
"Turkey is, furthermore, absolutely not a European country, but an Asian one, while Turkish membership would cost Dutch citizens sacks full of money yet again."
"Turkey can be a good neighbour, but it does not belong within the European family."
"The Party for Freedom stands for a Europe of sovereign states, but further building work towards a federal superstate where the Member States get to determine less and less of their own affairs is taking place under the Swedish Presidency."
"We therefore hope that the people of Ireland will have the courage to vote 'no', once again, to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The Irish population has the opportunity, here, to act as the voice of the people of Europe, and I would like to ask you, on behalf of the Party for Freedom, what conclusions the Swedish Presidency will draw from the result of the Irish referendum."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, allow me first to congratulate you all collectively on having been elected as group leaders."
"I know that a number of you were elected with very strong support."
"I know, for example, that Martin Schulz was re-elected with very strong support in the social democrat group."
"It is important to be able to represent your respective groups strongly."
"I very much welcomed the dialogue that we have had and the consultations which I was asked to introduce by the European Council during the month of June."
"This was done by EU Minister Cecilia Malmström."
"I also did it myself, both through telephone contacts and at the meeting that we had on a boat in the archipelago as we moved through the waters of Stockholm, sitting and discussing the situation that had arisen."
"I had been asked to investigate the possibility of electing José Manuel Barroso, appointed by the European Council, as president of the Commission for a second period of office."
"A number of the matters that you touched upon are the main issues that I want to work on during the Swedish Presidency."
"Let me say that we are putting jobs first."
"We want to see a Europe in which more people have work."
"The discussion must start from how we achieve this."
"Just as Joseph Daul pointed out, I believe it is a matter of innovation and training; in other words, the things that basically drive enterprise and make people employable."
"I believe that Martin Schulz is right that we must be wary of ending up a Europe in which we compete on the basis of poor terms."
"We are having this discussion in Sweden, and it is also taking place around Europe."
"Having low or no pay is not a good starting point from which to try to face the competition; rather, it is only with good conditions that we can face the competition of the future."
"Allow me to mention some other things that I believe are very important for steering Europe through the crisis."
"I have seen how the Commission - and I myself think this is important - has managed to defend the principle of the internal market at a time when many are attempting to compromise it and bring in protectionism."
"It is very easy to listen to those who are saying 'Why did you not save the jobs in this particular country?' without seeing the consequences of this if everyone acted in this way."
"If we did, we would basically extinguish free trade and the opportunity for cross-border trade."
"That which has basically created wealth and prosperity would very quickly be lost had we not resisted the call for protectionism."
"I believe that safeguarding the internal market and free movement is an important starting point for securing jobs."
"I also have great faith in other things mentioned by some of you, such as investing in human skills and ensuring mobility in the labour market."
"I believe, for example, that one way to manage this is precisely this free movement - including across borders."
"Just as Martin Schultz, Rebecca Harms and Joseph Daul mentioned, I believe that this is also an opportunity to combat this with a green trend, to bring about the low emission economies that we are talking about all over the world as another way of getting out of the crisis."
"How we manage financing and how we invest are important."
"I also want to say - I agree with Guy Verhofstadt on this point - that the Swedish experience of crisis management in the 1990s was that it can only be done by keeping a grip on public finances."
"I have learnt that when deficits are large and rationalisation is called for, it is people with small margins and those that are most dependent on welfare institutions who are left behind."
"Consequently, a policy that is prudent with public finances is a good policy for people who are poor or living on small margins."
"Where the climate issue is concerned - which will be the main issue we work on ahead of the Copenhagen summit - I want to say that it is true that there is still a lot to do."
"Time is short."
"I want to tell Rebecca Harms that it is unusual for us in Sweden to be criticised for our aid commitments."
"The average spent in Europe on such commitments is 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product."
"Sweden is fairly unique in that one per cent of our gross domestic product goes to development aid."
"For me, these matters are related."
"We carried out our own review under the leadership of our aid minister within the framework of the UN's initiatives."
"During this we analysed precisely how we need to bear climate change in mind in our development work."
"You cannot carry on development work without at the same time looking at climate change and how it is already affecting poor parts of the earth."
"Consequently, we cannot separate these issues and say that this is development policy and that is climate policy - rather they are related and have to work together."
"Where the Treaty is concerned, I would like to say to Martin Schulz that my role is to ensure that there is effective European leadership in a difficult period."
"We must be able to give answers to the citizens who want to see us take action to combat the financial crisis and on climate issues."
"We are all politically active and know that in the political domain, when we are inward-looking and discuss names and leadership our citizens perceive this as us having turned our backs on them."
"We are looking inwards."
"Therefore I will do what I can in my role."
"I have been tasked by the European Council with ensuring that our cooperation and our respect for the integrity of the European Parliament are united by clarity - whether under the Treaty of Nice or the Treaty of Lisbon - in our nomination of a candidate to the post of Commission President."
"Where José Manuel Barroso is concerned, it is important to state that he was unanimously supported in the European Council, that he was well known as a candidate and had already been introduced to the electorate prior to the election."
"Naturally, that made it easier for me to act - naturally respecting the fact that the European Parliament will be given opportunity, when you feel ready to make a decision, to say yes or no to the candidate nominated by the European Council."
"Meanwhile there is time for discussions, which I know José Manuel Barroso has also stated, and to have this type of dialogue concerning how European policy is to develop in the years ahead."
"I hope that this can now be agreed in accordance with the agreement that has been made."
"It is what the electorate of Europe now expects, and will enable us to act together with strength."
"Mr President, some important questions have been asked;"
"I shall try to answer them very briefly."
"Firstly, Mr Schulz's important question regarding the treaties."
"He referred, in particular, to the Commission's role as guardian of the treaties."
"We in the Commission believe that there should be respect for the treaties in force."
"The treaty in force is the Treaty of Nice."
"All of you who are sitting here were elected under the Treaty of Nice."
"Obviously, if the President of the Commission is elected now, he will be elected as you were, under the Treaty of Nice."
"That being said, we are going to have - I hope - the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The necessary adjustments will have to be made as regards the composition of Parliament, which will no longer be the same with the Treaty of Lisbon, since there will be certain changes, and the same will have to be done for the Commission."
"Nonetheless, the European Council adhered to every aspect of your report - the Dehaene report - which was adopted by an overwhelming majority."
"On the subject of the European Council, before formalising its decision, it carried out consultations, which also took into account - and this is a real first - the result of the European elections, not to mention the fact that there had been a candidate supported by a political force."
"The task now is to gain the approval of the European Parliament."
"I should like to repeat today what I have already said in a letter sent to the President of the European Parliament: I am ready to discuss the content of the guidelines for the next Commission with any political group that wishes to discuss them."
"In any case, that is my position as regards institutional matters."
"On a political level, I should like to stress a very important point. I believe that it is important to link the election of the President of the Commission to the democratic election that has taken place, your election."
"You have been elected by virtue of the Treaty of Nice, and it is my view that the President of the Commission should also have this legitimacy, which should in a way result from this democratic election."
"Furthermore, in view of the economic and financial crisis - and I believe that those who are in favour of a strong Europe and who want a strong Commission will no doubt agree - the matter of Presidency of the Commission should not be left unresolved now pending the final ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which we all want - at least the majority of us do - when we do not know when that treaty will come into force."
"Leaving the European Commission and its Presidency in a state of suspense when there is an economic crisis, a financial crisis and a social crisis, and when we have very important negotiations ahead of us in Copenhagen, does not seem very wise to me."
"Be that as it may, it is up to the European Parliament to decide, and I am ready to enter into a democratic debate as, in fact, I did five years ago."
"On the second question about finance and the economy and what Mr Verhofstadt said: we can all have more ambition, and on that matter let me tell you that I share your ambition."
"But we cannot say that we did not adopt a European economic recovery plan, and that was the maximum that our Member States accepted."
"The European Commission proposed more, but that was what our Member States accepted."
"I want to draw your attention to the fact that some Member States - no less influential at the beginning of this crisis - suggested not to have a coordination plan."
"Some others suggested a fiscal stimulus of 1%, and the European Commission came immediately to the proposal of 1.5%, and in fact the automatic stabilisers were around 5%."
"Apart from that, we took those important decisions in terms of balance-of-payment support to some non-euro-area members and also some initiatives at global level."
"So you may count on the Commission to do everything we can do to reinforce the European level and a common approach, let us have no ambiguity about it."
"But, also, let us be honest with ourselves: we are not the United States of America - we are not an integrated nation state - so of course we have different situations."
"You cannot ask Germany and Latvia to do the same thing."
"We have countries in Europe that are under balance-of-payment support, so of course we cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach."
"We have to have a common approach but with specific national responses, because that is the reality we are facing in European and will face in the near future."
"We have mainly national budgets."
"So I share your approach to have a more coordinated European plan, namely to get out of this crisis and to build this kind of smart green growth we want; but at the same time we have to accept that we have 27 national budgets, we have 27 finance ministers, we have 27 national banks apart from our European Central Bank, and it is very important to reinforce the euro and to have economic policies and financial policies that are sustainable."
"If not, we will put the euro, one of the great successes of European integration, at risk."
"Finally, on the question of climate change, once again we can always have more ambition."
"But for me it was very important that Prime Minister Reinfeldt was with me recently in L'Aquila, when we heard the Secretary-General of the United Nations say: 'You are the locomotive of the world'."
"We can always have more ambition, but the European Union is leading the fight against climate change in the world."
"No one is being more ambitious than we are, so of course I would expect at least a word of recognition in terms of the work done by this Commission, together with our Member States, to put forward ambitious proposals."
"Let us now try to convince others, because we need others - because the problem of climate change is not just a European problem, it is a problem for our planet."
"With your support I believe we can achieve success at the Copenhagen Conference."
"(Applause)"
"(SV) Mr President, as a Swede it is with pride that I listen to the Swedish Presidency's priorities and I am also proud to be able to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden back here again."
"The challenges we face are very substantial."
"We have 20 years of fantastic, miraculous change in Europe behind us, and as a result we now have one of the early representatives of the Solidarność movement for freedom as president of the European Parliament."
"It is ideals such as democracy, freedom, the rule of law and the market economy that have given us 20 years of fantastic development."
"We are now living in a time of change with a new treaty, the climate issue which demands a consistent policy capable of global impact, and the economic crisis."
"It is therefore important that we have a presidency, but also a parliament, that is capable of ensuring that we get stability as regards public finances, stability as regards the internal market and stability as regards openness to trade and movement across borders that can help to take us out of the crisis."
"I would like to take this perspective one step further."
"The decisions for which we are now preparing the way through the Swedish Presidency and in this Parliament will also decide the form that Europe and the European Union will take after the crisis - what dynamics we have in the financial markets and what confidence and credibility they enjoy, and what room we have for innovation and enterprise, for investments and new jobs."
"If the elections to the European Parliament showed one thing, it is that the citizens of Europe want less bureaucracy and regulation and greater openness - across the borders and out to the world."
"It is this openness that will be crucial to Europe's ability to be a leading force for the values that 20 years ago began to change Europe, and to which we can also contribute out in the world."
"(Applause)"
"(SV) Mr President, I would first like to thank the Swedish Prime Minister for his presentation of what he and his government want to do in the coming six months."
"We know that we are in a tough starting position; the crisis is deep."
"It is about jobs, it is about dramatically growing chasms, it is about a generation of young people who are going straight into unemployment and of course it is about the environmental and climate crisis."
"This has also been described by Prime Minister Reinfeldt, but it is the conclusions that are surprising."
"What has been highlighted as the central issue for the Swedish Presidency is not jobs or investments, but rather the Member States' ability to maintain budgetary discipline."
"As we approach 27 million unemployed in the EU, the clearest message from the Swedish Presidency is thus: budgetary discipline."
"This is not only wrong, but also worrying."
"In this area Mr Reinfeldt's party - contrary to what has been said here earlier - comes with some hefty historical domestic policy baggage."
"The last conservative Swedish Government led Sweden into economic disintegration, and it was a social democratic government that had to devote 10 years to sorting out our public finances."
"However, we cannot allow old shortcomings in domestic policy to set the agenda for the whole of the EU at a time of serious crisis."
"What is needed is major investments in jobs, training and green change - not putting anorexic economies on a diet by means of budgetary discipline."
"John Monks, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, has also expressed concern that the social dimension of the Swedish Presidency has been given such low priority."
"Mostly fine words, says Mr Monks, very little in the way of real plans."
"My group shares these concerns, and they also include the trade union rights of workers, as Martin Schulz stated in his speech."
"Workers' terms have deteriorated following the Laval judgment and following the Viking, Rüffert and Luxembourg judgments."
"Their rights have been weakened."
"What I and my group want from the Swedish Presidency is a definite commitment that the EU's workers will have their full trade union rights restored."
"Trade union rights must take precedence over free movement."
"That must be extremely clear."
"We do not want to live in a Europe in which the crisis is met with budgetary discipline and with confrontation."
"Is this matter even on the agenda, I would like to ask the new president, Prime Minister Reinfeldt."
"(FR) Mr President, we are faced with two issues."
"The first issue is the crisis."
"As everyone knows, we need a consistent and common response to the economic and social crisis and thus a European recovery plan to increase investments and to support employment."
"Europe really must show today that it is more attentive and closer to our fellow citizens when it comes to the difficulties they are facing."
"It must do more to help those who are affected by the crisis."
"From that perspective, the situation is urgent."
"The second issue is finally that of the new development model that must come out of the end of the crisis."
"It must be a simpler, fairer and more sustainable model, which ensures that finance serves the real economy, which develops new forms of solidarity among Europeans, which takes account of the social and environmental challenges in international trade, and which radically reforms our relations with the world's poorest countries, and here I am thinking specifically of Africa."
"In addition to these two major issues there is a democratic requirement that concerns the process for which you, the Swedish Presidency, are responsible."
"Cecilia Malmström - whom I am pleased to welcome today - knows better than anyone that there are some very important differences between the Treaty of Nice and the Treaty of Lisbon where the appointment procedure is concerned: a simple majority on one hand, and a qualified majority on the other; an appointment on one hand, and a nomination on the other; and a different number of commissioners depending on the treaty."
"For my part I am really asking you to ensure that the spirit and the letter of the treaties are respected."
"This falls under your remit, and it is very important for the credibility of our institutions. Thank you in advance."
"(SV) Mr President, congratulations on your appointment."
"I would first like to commend the government for having a genuine commitment to the Baltic Sea and I hope that we will make progress here."
"You also have remarkably good rhetoric on climate change."
"What I am now looking for, of course, is for this rhetoric to be put into practice."
"You often say that Europe and Sweden account for only a small part of the world's emissions, but if the EU Member States are home to just eight per cent of the world's population and account for 30 per cent of emissions, then it is also our responsibility to take a large part of the climate work seriously."
"It is here that I find the concrete information lacking."
"How are you going to deal with the IPPC Directive on industrial emissions?"
"How are you going to deal with illegal felling?"
"How are you going to deal with energy efficiency standards for buildings and how are you going to deal with the fact that aircraft cannot continue with their emissions while at the same time avoiding paying the EUR 14 billion in energy tax that they should pay?"
"Then I would also like to bring up the Stockholm Programme and Acta."
"Where Acta is concerned, we must ensure that there is openness here."
"The German constitutional court has said that the countries must have more influence, that the parliaments must have more influence."
"We need openness in the Acta negotiations."
"We cannot move towards supervision unilaterally."
"The same applies to my hometown and the Stockholm Programme."
"Let it become a name that is associated with the EU's transition from terror paranoia to human freedoms and rights and with a strengthening of asylum law and the protection of privacy."
"Then we will have made progress."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency for prioritising economic challenges."
"Whilst we have economic uncertainty, our ability to face any of our other challenges is obviously diminished."
"You are right to prioritise the need to restore public finances: the extraordinarily high levels of public debt pose great and long-term threats that, unless we face up to them now, may be with us for many decades."
"But restoring health to financial institutions is also key to regaining the confidence of consumers and returning economic growth, let alone taxpayers' money."
"In your priorities you discuss the importance of the supervisory framework."
"I would add that regulatory clarity is vital."
"These industries are, as we all know, global industries."
"The capital, the talent and the individual enterprises are highly fluid."
"They need workable and defined legislative timetables, prioritisation of legislation and proper consultation."
"I welcome your commitment to work alongside the G20, because if we get out of step and go unilateral in the EU we risk not only putting borrowers and investors at a competitive disadvantage but also causing industries to relocate outside..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(SV) Mr President, firstly of course I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as president and at the same time thank you for the interesting exchange of views that we had during the election period."
"Prime Minister and fellow Members, thank you for your account of the Presidency's programme."
"I am convinced that in organisational terms the Swedish Presidency will be a great success and that it will be taken care of truly excellently by the competent Swedish state administration."
"Politically, I naturally share the Presidency's opinion of the two major crises - the economic crisis and the climate crisis - and of course these are the priority issues."
"However, where is the analysis?"
"The economic crisis and the climate crisis were not predestined by fate."
"The crises have their origin in political decisions made."
"This is a positive thing, because it means that we can also solve the crises through political decisions - but I see no sign of a change to different policies from the Presidency."
"It is the same economic policy that takes no account of social or environmental considerations."
"What I and many of our citizens are looking for in the programme is workers' rights, which have come into focus following the court rulings, and social issues, where no answers are forthcoming."
"Neither have we heard anything about the famous progressive equality policy."
"Where the Stockholm Programme is concerned, it is said that it will create security, but in practice what is emerging is a 'big brother' state that threatens personal privacy."
"We can never accept restrictions on asylum rights or restrictions on our rights as free citizens in this programme."
"We need a humane asylum and immigration policy."
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sweden has always respected human rights and democracy."
"Some time ago the Swedish people voted against the euro, and you have respected that decision, although you yourself were strongly in favour."
"That is why it is rather odd that Ireland should now promptly have to vote once again on exactly the same treaty."
"It is the Nordic and the Swedish way to respect the voice of the people."
"I wish you luck and success in the challenge that you now face."
"I hope that you will respect the values of the best sort of Nordic democracy: not through compulsion but through cooperation."
"I am very pleased that you mentioned the Baltic Sea, and I fully support you in this matter."
"The Baltic Sea is in difficulties; it is dying and it needs to be saved."
"The Northern Dimension has been missing in all this, however, and I hope that you will do a lot to promote it, although you made no mention of it."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy."
"We need bold democrats and in this new period we urgently need an exciting, democratic and genuinely effective Europe."
"Creative artists and, in particular, freelance writers, will have a role in identifying the values of this new Europe."
"Their uncensored imagination will be able to put the bureaucratic genie which aims to destroy democracy back in its bottle."
"After all, it is exciting ideas that lie behind at the birth of social change."
"Those who can offer visions of hope which allow them to get inside people's minds - the Swedes have been particularly good at this in the past, and in this respect I have every confidence in my former colleague Cecilia Malmström - can also inspire their interest in socio-political matters."
"This is how I deliberately worded the final paragraph of my new book at the beginning of this last election campaign, which brought about major changes and which is linked to a great deal of hope that you in particular from Sweden with your great democratic tradition and transparency will now recognise the signs of the times."
"We are not only facing the economic crisis - and here the Swedes have shown their cleverness by largely avoiding it - but we also have to deal with a rather ominous swing to the right."
"I therefore firmly believe that together we democrats must stand up for genuine transparency and in particular we must stand together in the fight against the extreme right."
"(NL) My heartfelt thanks for the ambitious plans that you have laid out for the coming six months."
"I can tell you that we have high expectations of you, as you have had the reputation right from the very beginning of having gone into bat for European integration and for our European values."
"It is important that the solutions that we put forward and that you are working on to get us out of this economic crisis reinforce our social market economy."
"It is also important that these solutions do not only benefit our citizens today and tomorrow, but also provide for our children's future."
"It is therefore so very important to continue to build towards a sustainable economy and towards preventing climate change."
"It is good that you give such a high priority to this in your programme."
"I sincerely hope that your efforts in these areas help to bring the Member States closer together and that, in the run-up to the Copenhagen Conference, you also manage to induce the biggest players on the world stage to really play their part in finding a solution to climate change."
"Mr President, the social market economy is also important when it comes to sustainable government finances, since government deficits form a burden for future generations."
"It is therefore important to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and it is also good that you have said so expressly."
"Mr President, it is ironic, but the financial crisis has brought Iceland closer to the European Union."
"I hope that the Swedish Presidency is welcoming towards Iceland, but that it is also strict in ensuring that Iceland complies with the requirements for accession and that it meets the obligations relating to European legislation and towards the Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, I hope you will allow me in this connection to speak in particular to Carl Bildt, because I would firstly like to touch on the subject of enlargement, particularly in the Balkans."
"You mentioned that this enlargement process will be slower than many people on both sides would have wished."
"However, it is very important to give clear signals."
"What I expect from the Swedish Presidency is help in particular for the people in south eastern Europe to overcome the problems they are facing there - including the intergovernmental problems - so that they can feel hopeful that the road to Europe will not be blocked off, but that progress can continue to be made, even if it perhaps takes a little longer."
"However, the appropriate preparations must naturally be made by these countries."
"Secondly, I would like to refer to another subject that you mentioned, namely the issue of restructuring the economy and the linking of economic policy and the environment."
"It has already been said that you have our full support in this."
"I believe that this is an important task for Europe."
"It is true that in this regard we are very much at the forefront, but we still have a lot to do."
"At the same time, unemployment is also rising."
"The level of unemployment that we are seeing today in Europe has not yet reached its maximum."
"It will, unfortunately, get even worse."
"It is therefore extremely important to mention the other dimension, the social dimension, as we will only receive broad support for the green restructuring of the economy if people feel that their social needs and requirements are also being taken seriously."
"The Nordic countries in particular have a lot of good examples of an active labour market policy."
"We are not able, either as the EU or as individual Member States, to create jobs, but we can help people who have lost their jobs to find work again as quickly as possible."
"That is what we mean by a social Europe - this active labour market policy that we need in the individual Member States, which the European Union and the Council in particular must give out a clear message about."
"The green restructuring of the economy will ultimately result in lower, not higher, unemployment."
"This is what we are calling for."
"(SV) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, good to see you here!"
"There are many challenges in these turbulent times: a severe economic recession, the uncertainty as regards the Treaty of Lisbon and the negotiations ahead of the climate conference in Copenhagen."
"You have a lot on your plate."
"Prime Minister, a few important points."
"You also have to convince your colleagues on the Council that protectionism is an abomination."
"The strength of the EU lies in its open borders and free trade."
"State subsidies to rescue the car industry are not the solution."
"The financial crisis cries out for a new global order, but the regulations must be balanced and must not be excessive."
"This autumn, as some here have mentioned, the EU must come a bit closer to a respectable asylum policy."
"The energy policy, just as some have said, requires both realism and solidarity."
"No new gas crises, no unilateral dependence."
"The Internet was an important issue in the election campaign."
"Here Sweden has a great responsibility to bring what is known as the Telecoms package to a successful conclusion."
"The rule of law must also apply in the virtual world."
"I had hoped that during this session Parliament would approve the appointment of José Manuel Barroso as President of the Commission for a new five-year period."
"Now this will not be the case, and I am sorry for that."
"Now is not the time for the EU to spend its time on institutional power struggles."
"Now is the time for political leadership and drive."
"The euro has proved its strength."
"When does the Prime Minister think that we in Sweden will be prepared to become full EU members and have the euro in our pockets too?"
"Thank you, and as we say in my party: good luck!"
"(FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sweden now has a huge responsibility for the future of the human race."
"Prime Minister Reinfeldt, you spoke quite rightly of the climate crisis."
"We know that the technology we need over the decades to come exists, and that it is available at a fair price, but the most problematic issue is that climate protection is an incredible challenge to human cooperation."
"Unfortunately, the negotiations that are currently going on are more like a combination of hide-and-seek and a competition in self-congratulation."
"The European Union must have the courage to put forward a proposal regarding not just the EU's own emission reductions, but the principle of burden-sharing, where all industrialised countries accomplish emission reductions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines."
"The most important thing is that we achieve the emission reduction targets for 2020."
"Secondly, it needs to be realised that the developing countries will not be able to adjust to a system of adequate emission limits unless we assist them financially at a completely new level, and the EU should be in a position to make proposals on that too."
"(PL) Prime Minister, we listened to your speech with great care and would like to express the hope that the most important points of the programme will be put into effect successfully."
"I would like, however, to draw attention to three challenges."
"The first of these is European solidarity, which is especially important at a time of financial crisis."
"We cannot allow situations to arise in which particular European countries are treated unequally."
"We cannot accept a situation in which some are allowed to subsidise their banking sector and others are condemned for attempting to strengthen their shipbuilding sector."
"That is not solidarity, that is hypocrisy."
"Secondly, we are glad that the Baltic Sea Strategy is one of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency."
"This is an important area of macroregional cooperation."
"The Baltic ecosystem should be protected from hazards such as the very unsafe, and also financially absurd, Nord Stream project."
"The need for diversification of energy sources should also be mentioned."
"Thirdly, let us remember that Moscow does not restrict itself to turning off the tap, as Georgia discovered."
"I hope that, as Sweden takes the helm of the European Union for the next six months, it will be as resolute as Minister Carl Bildt, who condemned the Russian aggression against Georgia."
"I am sure that the Swedish Presidency will be equal to these challenges."
"It can count on our support."
"(DA) Mr President, there are two things that struck me when I read the Swedish Presidency's work programme."
"The first thing is all the promises about how the EU will be used to create a better economy for solving climate and other problems, but there is not a single word about the problems that the EU creates - the problems that the EU has created in our labour markets, the problems that the EU has created in our fisheries sector, in our economy, in connection with the fight against crime and I could go on."
"This is the first key observation we can make when reading the Swedish Presidency's work programme - that the EU only represents solutions and that the EU is not a problem."
"This says more about the Swedish Presidency than it says about the EU. The second thing is that there is no mention of the fact that 2 October will be one of the most significant days in the entire history of the EU, and this will be during the term of the Swedish Presidency."
"I am, of course, referring to the second referendum."
"There is not a word about what the Swedish Presidency will do to ensure that the so-called guarantees that have been given to the Irish people will also be regarded as such."
"We have seen before how people have been deceived - deceived over referendums and deceived over democracy."
"What will the Swedish Presidency do to ensure that this does not happen again?"
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to welcome the Swedes and also offer my congratulations that they - as the Prime Minister said - have finally found their way to Europe after a long process."
"We are very pleased to find that Swedes today are among the best Europeans."
"You have presented your programme and it is very ambitious."
"However, I would like to ask you to consider whether Sweden would have the courage to take the step, particularly after the experience of the financial market crisis, of joining the euro - especially as you said that the Stability and Growth Pact must be complied with."
"You, of course, have no opt-out clause like the United Kingdom and Denmark, for example, and you meet all of the conditions now."
"Will you have the courage during your Presidency to stabilise Europe further and become a member of the euro zone?"
"Prime Minister, I agree with your prioritising of climate policy and the Baltic Sea Strategy, but with regard to your programme in its written form, I have a request: please pay more attention than proposed to combating the financial market crisis."
"None of the other projects will have a chance if the crisis in the financial markets and in the economy is not resolved as quickly as possible."
"For this we need clear rules."
"It is not enough for the City of London once again to determine the course."
"We need clear rules in the social market economy, because a market economy without rules cannot operate and will not receive majority support."
"Therefore, you should consider once again - although we fully support your programme - whether you should not give the subject of overcoming the financial market crisis higher priority than you have done so far."
"Thank you very much and good luck in a difficult time of upheaval."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, we have all listened to the Swedish Presidency's programme with great interest and appreciation."
"Its clear priorities are the economy and energy, because the European Union's priority is to help restart the economy and generate employment, curb unemployment and ensure that the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009 is a success."
"However, I would like to draw attention to a political, civic and democratic objective, which is to replace the Hague Programme with the programme that will be named after the Swedish capital: Stockholm."
"The programme combines the achievements of the area of freedom, security and justice over the last five years, which have been very significant in terms of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the principle of trust in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection, but also in relation to active cooperation."
"I invite you to be ambitious in this area: firstly, from a substantive point of view, as in all areas related to managing external borders, immigration, asylum, refugees and combating illegal trafficking, organised crime and terrorism it is easy to drift towards reactionary positions that contradict the acquis of fundamental rights that should set the European Union apart and which Sweden identifies with so much, as a country that respects transparency and democratic principles."
"Secondly, I invite you to also be ambitious in terms of the form, because the Swedish Presidency is most probably going to clear the way for Lisbon, which firstly means that there will no longer be that double procedural framework of the third and first pillars, which is often confusing."
"However, and most significantly, it will also mean that Parliament will have greater capacity to monitor the legislative initiatives that the Swedish Presidency implements as part of the Stockholm Programme."
"This means that what has so far often been seen as a deficiency of Brussels or of the Council will also be the responsibility of Parliament."
"(SV) Mr President, naturally I am very pleased and proud to see my government in the Swedish Presidency and I also think that the programme contains a lot that is good as regards solutions for the climate, jobs, the financial crisis, the Copenhagen Conference, the Baltic Sea Strategy, Community policy, enlargement, Iceland, Croatia, Turkey, etc. However, I can see another matter that is important for the future: namely open Europe, privacy and freedom of expression."
"Today the ministers are meeting in Stockholm to discuss the Stockholm Programme."
"What is good is that this is the strategy for the legislation that is now to be drawn up."
"Parts of the proposal have been long awaited."
"Ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights will finally take place, I hope - the rights of the child and of the victims of crime."
"We can make something really good come of this, but there are also downsides; namely the threat to the open society that the Stockholm Programme contains."
"Threats to our open society must be fought off using the methods of the open society."
"Some of what is contained in the Stockholm Programme is not liberal, and neither is it humane or far-sighted."
"Registering our travel, the mass storage of personal details and the systematic charting of economic transactions is not liberal, nor is it tolerant or far-sighted."
"Let Stockholm stand for openness, freedom and tolerance, not registration, supervision and intolerance."
"Furthermore, I believe that our work in Strasbourg must be discontinued."
"Before giving the floor to Mr Stolojan, I should like to welcome a guest of ours, a child who is sitting in seat 505."
"It gives me particular pleasure to see children taking an interest in European issues and in our institutions because it is important to grow up as Europeans from an early age."
"(RO) I wish the Swedish Presidency every success and I believe that the priorities set out are those we have been expecting."
"The next six months are crucial for Europe's citizens and for the European Union."
"They are crucial in terms of whether our countries are going to emerge from the economic crisis next year or whether, on the other hand, a large question mark will continue to hang over the economy for another year."
"Many proposals and new programmes are being put forward."
"However, I think it is time for us to assess the impact which the economy recovery programme launched by the European Commission at the start of the year is having, if any at all, and for us to take a close look at the European Union's budget for this year to see which activities have stopped and what resources we can continue to use to come up with new measures."
"We also have investment projects planned for the energy sector which have already been approved from that amount of around EUR 3 billion."
"We will have to take specific measures to implement these projects."
"I would like to thank President Barroso for his particular contribution to getting the Nabucco project off the ground."
"Finally, I would like you to remember the European Union's political commitment to other countries also successfully joining the European Union."
"Mr President, we will not overcome the deep financial, economic and jobs crisis - or climate change - as independent, protectionist nation states."
"Without Europe and the euro we are sunk as a continent, but neither can we continue as a union as though nothing was wrong except a few greedy bankers: budgeting discipline will not solve the problem."
"The system is broken and must be deeply reformed."
"Already the financial institutions are resisting the regulations we need to prevent a future meltdown."
"We need more integration of our social and economic and climate and energy policies, with the objective of job retention and creation with decent living and working conditions."
"We need a breakthrough in the climate change summit in December."
"We need, more than ever now, a recommitment to the Millennium Development Goals and, more immediately, Mr President-in-Office, I regret you did not call for an immediate lifting of the siege of Gaza or indicate any wish to re-energise the search for peace alongside President Obama."
"As a Member from Ireland, I would like to remind the House that political irony is a trait much appreciated in Ireland."
"Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's Travels, once proposed to the British Government that the way of solving poverty in Ireland was to encourage us to eat our babies."
"Well, I do not think the historical irony of the United Kingdom Independence Party proposing to come to Ireland to campaign for the independence of the United Kingdom from the European Union will be lost on the people of Ireland as a subject for a good belly laugh."
"It will be something to see Mr Nigel Farage, dressed in his Union Jack and leprechaun hat, arm in arm with Gerry Adams, the former leader of the IRA, and Joe Higgins, my colleague up here in the back, calling for a 'no' vote on the Lisbon Treaty, each with their own lemming-like contradictory agendas."
"I am confident the Irish people will tell this particular circus what they told Libertas: get lost!"
"(Applause)"
"(EL) Mr President, the programme of the Swedish Presidency does indeed include all the important issues which have to do with our times, both present and future."
"I shall start with the recession."
"I assume that the Swedish Presidency will need to go into this issue in greater depth."
"The social market economy needs investments in the real economy and not simply in financial products such as those which put us in the situation we are in today."
"The issue of climate and sustainable development, which also includes social development, and the issue of work, are obviously extremely important issues."
"However, here too real investment is needed in the economy, together with more control."
"A market economy which tries to move towards a laisser faire - laisser passer approach is not what we need in Europe."
"The issues of crime, home affairs and justice truly concern us all."
"Organised crime certainly is no longer what it once was and it certainly has links with terrorism and every form of illegal activity."
"It therefore requires a differentiated approach."
"I think what is most important is that we also examine, in relation to the large number of immigrants from third countries, whether the European Union's development policy really did succeed and on which points; in other words, we need a real evaluation and to examine what could or should have been changed in order for illegal immigration to be dealt with in the right way, because we are actually dealing with people and not just political or administrative acts."
"The programme of the Swedish Presidency is truly very ambitious, especially, among other things, on trans-Atlantic dialogue."
"However, on this issue too we must examine whether it is expedient for the European Union to be concerned solely with development and for the United States to be concerned solely with security."
"(LV) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, firstly I would like to congratulate the Swedish Government on the objectives it has set out for its presidency."
"This is not an easy time for Europe; it is full of challenges."
"Of the many important priorities that Sweden has set out for its presidency, I would like to draw attention to the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region, and particularly that part of it relating to energy market security."
"Joint security for Europe's energy market will not be possible so long as divided and mutually isolated markets exist in Europe, both in electricity and in gas."
"For historical reasons, this problem is particularly pronounced in the Baltic Sea region."
"In order to resolve this problem and spread the risk relating to energy supply, we need a common European Union energy policy."
"The foundation stones of such a policy must be not only energy efficiency and renewable resources, but also the creation of a common electricity and gas market with operational interconnections."
"The European Union's strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a step in the right direction."
"Its aim is to gradually connect up the energy markets in the region, overcoming deficiencies in interconnections and creating common market mechanisms."
"The legacy of the Soviet Union occupation in the Baltic Sea region is a split and partially isolated market, which increases our energy supply risk."
"Our challenge for the future is to change this situation, and by doing so boost our joint energy security."
"I wish the Swedish Presidency luck in making an energetic start on this important task. Thank you for your attention."
"(SV) Mr President, Prime Minister, if we are to get a good international climate agreement we must also listen to other countries."
"If we do so we will realise that firstly what is required is that the EU and other countries take greater responsibility for reducing our emissions at home, and secondly that the EU and other industrialised countries state in concrete terms how we will contribute economically to the climate work of poorer countries."
"The fact that up to now the Swedish Government has worked against this has unfortunately undermined the opportunities to get a good agreement in Copenhagen."
"The Council of Ministers must also realise this, and I would therefore ask two questions."
"Is the Swedish Presidency prepared to contribute to a good international climate agreement by making a greater part of the EU's cuts in emissions on home soil?"
"When does it intend presenting specific proposals to finance the climate work of poor countries?"
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on its historic opportunity to steer the EU toward implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I would like to make three points."
"First, it is of extreme importance to have the new Commission made operational as soon as possible."
"Institutional uncertainty cannot be used as an excuse to delay the formation of the new Commission."
"These arguments sound really hypocritical."
"To come out of the economic crisis and to create new jobs, we need more than ever a strong, independent and innovative Commission."
"Second, I would like to commend the Swedish Presidency on taking the lead in the implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy, which was initiated by the European Parliament."
"However, there is also a special budget line for this strategy which is still empty."
"We cannot expect a positive change in the environmental situation in the Baltic Sea by relying only on ad hoc projects."
"We certainly need also coordinated support from the EU budget."
"Third, for Estonia the Stockholm programme is important."
"It should also include a programme for using modern IT."
"I am wondering whether the establishment of an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice would be of help in implementing this strategy."
"(SV) Mr President, congratulations on your appointment."
"I would also like to thank Fredrik Reinfeldt for an extraordinary review and report."
"We all now expect great achievements in Copenhagen, although it must also be emphasised that this is to be an international event."
"Expectations have really been raised, but I dare say that if not all the groups are satisfied with the result then it will not be the end of the world."
"Naturally the economic crisis has been highlighted here."
"The big groups, the big companies always get attention."
"I would like to emphasise that the small loyal subcontractors should not be forgotten either when financial matters are under discussion."
"I would also like to underline the specific values of the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"I believe that the Baltic Sea Strategy could increase the legitimacy of the entire EU."
"Europe's largest inland sea can and must be saved."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy can also help to check the crime trend and trafficking."
"This is also an important environmental issue that you could say demands its own Copenhagen Conference."
"I am pleased that the work on a border solution between Croatia and Slovenia is on the agenda and that the Cyprus question is also being resolved."
"We are all anxious to see this."
"We will also, I believe, gradually see the Nordic region enlarged here in the EU to include Iceland and, I imagine, also Norway within the not too distant future."
"President Barack Obama gave an extraordinary speech about Africa in Africa the other day."
"I have reason to stress that Sweden can be proud of its work and I hope that we can continue to hold the flag of solidarity high in the future."
"(NL) I think that we and the European project stand at a real crossroads."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, the Copenhagen climate conference and a vigorous approach to tackling the financial and economic crisis are the three great issues that you will have to deal with over the coming six months, and if we can bring them to a successful conclusion, Europe really could take a quantum leap forwards."
"You are no doubt aware that a large majority of MEPs are ready to lend their backing to this route and I would like to urge you, with a quip, to leave the critics and the barking dogs to make their racket on the sidelines."
"Let them not distract you from your mission, your purpose."
"I believe that we must concentrate on the essentials."
"Allow me to point out just one issue, Prime Minister Reinfeldt."
"It is crucial that we concentrate on one of the top priorities, namely an aggressive plan for the future of the automotive industry in the European Union."
"In my opinion, we have not had such a plan up to now, or at least we have had too little of one, and I think that you would agree with us there."
"It is definitely not too late."
"The rescue plan for Opel is in full swing and the world, and even Europe, is not rid of the demons of protectionism."
"They are slumbering beneath the surface, and Swedish society is just as affected as we in Belgium are, just as they are in France, Germany and Slovakia."
"We are all in the same boat."
"What is needed is for us to approach this in solidarity with one another, with a coordinated, rather than an 'every man for himself' approach, and that we do not attempt to clip each others' wings."
"Mr President, I think that you have a unique opportunity here to work with the President of the Commission - this also sends a clear signal to the Commission - to draw up a joint plan, a joint plan, Mr Barroso, for the future of our car factories, thereby steering them into the 21st century."
"We believe that the energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly car can be realised in Europe's existing car assembly factories and we are counting on you, Mr Barroso and Mr Reinfeldt, being on our side."
"(HU) In our view, Sweden is synonymous with Europe."
"This country is the home of prosperity, security and freedom, where the issues of human rights and freedoms are just as important as economic and climate change concerns."
"Then we have the parliament of an EU Member State which adopted a language law on 30 June 2009 stipulating that if anyone, including all of you, does not call that country's capital city by its name in the country's official language, Bratislava, but uses its German name, Presburg, or Hungarian name, Pozsony, they may very well end up paying a fine of EUR 5 000."
"The explanatory memorandum to the language law amendment states that protection of the national language in certain cases overrides the freedom of speech and right to privacy."
"A European Union which adopts such a law is no longer a Europe of freedom."
"I ask the Swedish Presidency to do its utmost to ensure that this law is repealed and that the Slovak head of state does not sign it."
"(HU) I would like to draw your attention to two of the Swedish Presidency's priorities which I was delighted to see on this list."
"The first of these priorities is the unequivocal opposition to discrimination, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and homophobia."
"I think that the importance of this issue is particularly underlined by the fact that we saw how evident the level of support was for the far right in several European countries during the European Parliament elections."
"This therefore makes it the responsibility of every one of us, including Parliament and the current Presidency, to ensure that the most vulnerable do not end up in a precarious situation."
"In particular, we must do everything to ensure that there is no cooperation between those parties professing to be democratic and the extremist parties."
"A very good example of this is the Slovak language law, mentioned already today on several occasions, which is severely discriminatory, as was described."
"The second priority which I would like to welcome is the series of European measures to be adopted, aimed at the integration of Roma communities."
"(PL) Mr President, continuation of enlargement of the European Union and the future of the Treaty of Lisbon are among the objectives of the Swedish Presidency."
"The German Constitutional Tribunal ruled recently that the Treaty of Lisbon can be accepted only on condition that the precedence of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat are safeguarded, which calls into question the idea of European federalism."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has, therefore, turned out to be a legal monster, which has been noticed not only by the Germans, but also by the Irish in a referendum and by the Presidents of the Czech Republic and Poland."
"In this context the Swedish Presidency should initiate a Europe-wide debate on the subject of the role of the national parliaments of all the 27 Member States, and should develop a new model of cooperation between sovereign European nations."
"It is, therefore, to be hoped that the Swedish Presidency, which I wish much success, will listen with greater attention to the voice of the citizens."
"(MT) I would also like to laud Prime Minister Reinfeld for staying with us until the very end of this discussion."
"We will be looking to the Presidency to implement three important priorities."
"The first is the Stockholm Programme on the area of justice, freedom and security."
"We have to ensure that agreement is reached on this programme as soon as possible."
"The second priority is the implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"We will be looking to you Prime Minister to ensure that you will implement the Pact that was agreed upon last year."
"Thirdly, last month, during the European Council, agreement was reached regarding the pilot project on burden sharing in the field of immigration."
"You have a great deal of work ahead of you Prime Minister, and we, together with our President, will be monitoring you closely to guarantee that this work is carried out."
"(PT) Since Dag Hammarskjöld, Sweden has distinguished itself as a member of the United Nations (UN)."
"It therefore knows that, without bodies with universally recognised legitimacy and representativeness, there will be no political force to conclude Kyoto2, the Doha Round or the Millennium Development Goals, or to regulate the global economy, not to mention defend human rights."
"It is regrettable that the Swedish Presidency is resigning itself to the informal and disputed framework of the G20."
"It is tragic that the EU - this locomotive of the world according to Mr Barroso, who was citing the UN Secretary-General - is leaderless and lacking in any strategic vision in this area, at a time when President Obama is proclaiming his commitment to global governance."
"Instead, on our side, we have only heard the Pope insisting on the urgent need to reorganise the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods Institutions."
"Mr President, why is the Swedish Presidency refusing to lead Europe into forcing reform of the UN Security Council, by demanding a seat at the table for the European Union with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"(GA) Mr President, the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, which will be held in Ireland on the second day of October this year, will be one of the most important events to occur during the period of the Swedish Presidency."
"Ireland has received legal guarantees in a range of policy areas and this is helping greatly to alleviate the concerns that the people of Ireland had in the referendum last year."
"Now, it is incumbent on those of us who believe that a vote in favour of the Treaty will be to the benefit of Ireland to work to progress this new arrangement in my country."
"If the Treaty of Lisbon succeeds - and I hope that the referendum will be passed - the various countries will be able to nominate a member to the Commission."
"Those in favour of the Treaty cannot afford to be complacent in any way."
"We must do our utmost to ensure its success."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, I would very much like to thank Prime Minister Reinfeld for including in his priorities the need to develop cooperation with our Eastern neighbours."
"I would also like to thank him for Sweden's engagement in development of the Eastern Partnership."
"In this context I would like to point out that in the next six months, we as the European Union and Sweden as the Presidency will have to face up to problems relating to the disregard of human rights in Belarus."
"For six months now, three entrepreneurs, Mr Avtukhowich, Mr Leonov and Mr Osipienko, have been held in detention and have not been able to obtain a just verdict."
"Of 12 young activists who took part in a demonstration in January 2008, 11 were given custodial sentences, and several days ago one was sentenced to a year in prison."
"Prime Minister, in the next six months please pay attention to the question of breaches of human rights in Belarus."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (SV) Mr President, I hope I can return a little of the time I borrowed earlier."
"(The President briefly cut off the speaker)"
"I know that you are waiting for a vote."
"Allow me to thank you for having represented your respective party groups very well."
"I note your eagerness and the expectations that there are of the Swedish Presidency, your desire for us to be more of a driving force in climate negotiations and to take action to combat the financial crisis and economic recession."
"You have noted our Baltic Sea Strategy, our Stockholm Programme, our continued efforts to drive forward the matter of enlargement, and I would like to thank you all for the support we are experiencing in this."
"I also know that the transition to the Treaty of Lisbon will mean that we meet again, and that we have a great deal to do together this autumn."
"A number of the ministers in my cabinet are here with me today."
"We have noted and carefully followed your questions and views."
"I hope that we will cooperate closely and I hope to see you again in the autumn."
"We also count on constant discussion and keeping in contact with the Presidency."
"It is very important for the European Parliament."
"It is the beginning of our term of office and we must do many things, and this is a very good starting point: the Swedish Presidency."
"Thank you very much, Prime Minister."
"I would also like to thank the President of the European Commission."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the Swedish Presidency's proposal to focus on questions of policy instead of constitutional questions during its presidency."
"However, the Council has decided to ignore the democratically expressed will of the Irish people, and they have made a decision to force the Treaty of Lisbon through."
"Unfortunately, the policy framework that they are pursuing is the same failed agenda of deregulation and liberalisation."
"This is not the appropriate response to the economic crisis."
"The complete opposite is the case, namely that it is a continuation of the same policies that instigated the crisis, and it is these same policies that are being further strengthened in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We are told that we need the Treaty of Lisbon because it has been long years in the making."
"But the Treaty of Lisbon was drafted and agreed before the economic crisis, and is based on policies that helped to ignite the crisis."
"To force through those outdated policies now would be disastrous, for it would make the crisis worse."
"There is a need for new policies for a new era."
"There is a need for a new Treaty for a new era."
"As far as climate change is concerned, it is important that the Swedish Presidency does its best to achieve a robust deal in Copenhagen."
"in writing. - The incoming Swedish Presidency has many challenges but the greatest is the need to ensure that the EU respects the sovereignty of the Member States and does not ride roughshod over the democratic rights of the peoples of Europe."
"Far too often the concerns and interests of our peoples are ignored in the headlong rush to advance the federalist agenda exemplified in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Looking to changes ahead, the preparations for the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013 will be an issue during this Presidency."
"The voice of areas heavily dependent on farming, like Northern Ireland, must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy."
"We have a great duty to help and protect our constituents at this time of great financial turbulence."
"The EU must not put further obstacles in the way of economic growth and stability."
"in writing. - (PT) The anti-social programme of the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union represents a dangerous step forward in the expansion of neoliberal policies."
"It reflects the relentless pursuit of these policies, despite all the evidence, by the leaders of capitalism in the European Union, who are forgetting that their policies are the main cause of the economic and social crisis."
"Although, in the presentation of its programme, the Swedish Presidency did refer to people and the problems of unemployment, it did not mention a single measure to change the existing policies which have caused these problems."
"Quite the contrary."
"In particular it highlighted the policy of free competition in the widest range of areas, including in services and foreign trade."
"It has gambled everything on the recovery of the financial markets, on the resumption of the paradigms of the Stability Pact and on the defence of neoliberalism, which will certainly result in new attacks on social and labour rights."
"It also did not forget to insist on a new referendum in Ireland on the draft Treaty of Lisbon, already planned for 2 October, in a continuation of the blackmail of the Irish people in order to move forward more quickly with the destruction of public services and the reduction of social rights, including in the areas of social security, health, water, social protection and workers' rights."
"It is not difficult to predict that it will submit new proposals for directives, which will try to adopt the same lines as those proposals that were rejected in the previous legislative term."
"I welcome the incoming Presidency and would like to express the hope that as the third member of the Council troika, Sweden will continue the work which was started during the Czech and French Presidencies in the area of Roma social integration."
"There were many factors which hampered the outgoing Czech Presidency's work, but the overall picture in terms of Roma issues is nevertheless positive."
"In fact, the Roma Platform held its first meeting in April in Prague, while, in June, the European Council strengthened its general objectives in terms of offering Roma equal opportunities by calling on the Commission and Member States to combat the poverty and social exclusion affecting Roma."
"In the same document the Council adopted the common basic principles set out in Prague for achieving Roma social integration, with a call to public policy-makers to take these principles into consideration and comply with them."
"Based on the results achieved by the troika so far, I hope that the Swedish Presidency will at least focus greater attention than before on Roma issues."
"For example, I hope that the forthcoming conference on the inclusive labour market to be held in October and the Equal Opportunities Summit due to take place in November will deal with the issue of Europe's largest minority as a main priority."
"Indeed, in terms of population size, it is considerably larger than the population living in the Baltic region, designated as a priority by this Presidency."
"I also hope that the Swedish Presidency will go beyond the theoretical approaches already adopted and the organisational issues decided and start to take specific actions, thereby actually putting these frameworks into practice."
"The Stockholm Programme, which is a priority for the Swedish Presidency, must provide support in reinforcing the area of freedom, security and justice, as well as in promoting economic activity during the current crisis, especially in view of the possibility of the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force."
"The success of the Stockholm Programme will help make Europe more accessible to its citizens."
"This success will be reflected in the enforcement of the right of freedom of movement for all European citizens and the comprehensive implementation of the mutual recognition principle in civil and criminal matters at EU level."
"The Swedish Presidency must continue the efforts of the French and Czech Presidencies, whose priorities were to provide all workers in the EU with complete access to the Community's labour market, a freedom which is most symbolic of European citizenship."
"In order to do this, Member States must actively participate through concrete actions in abolishing the virtual borders inside the EU which are detrimental to citizens' freedom of movement, as they encounter administrative and legal difficulties when they live and work in another Member State."
"The freedom of movement must be a reality for all EU citizens, especially during a time of economic crisis, which highlights the need to promote unrestricted mobility among the workforce."
"This mobility can be self-regulating and ensure flexibility, as well as reduce the amount of undeclared work and the natural unemployment rate."
"The EU is facing huge challenges nowadays: the economic and financial crisis, the alarming rise in unemployment and climate change."
"The unemployment rate in the EU is 8.9% at the moment, while 19% of young people under the age of 16 and 19% of elderly people are exposed to the risk of poverty."
"People are losing their jobs, many businesses are going bankrupt, while national budgets are in major deficit."
"The EU's Swedish Presidency has a huge responsibility towards its citizens."
"It must restore their hope of a decent living and lay the foundations for economic recovery by getting everyone to pull together."
"Such measures as increasing energy efficiency, using energy from renewable sources and improving the EU's energy security feature among the Swedish Presidency's priorities."
"I hope that the EU's Swedish Presidency will mark the start of an age of prosperity, guaranteeing a period of economic growth for the next 40-50 years."
"I believe that, now more than ever, we need to invest in education, research, energy efficiency and, above all, in people."
"Sweden is renowned for its social policies and high standard of living."
"This is why I would like, along with my fellow Members in the European Parliament and every citizen in Europe, to wish you every success, and we hope that this term will provide the springboard to a new future."
"in writing. - (EL) The priorities of the Swedish Presidency mark an escalation in the anti-grassroots attack by the EU, the aim of which is to safeguard the ongoing profitability of euro-unifying capital by shifting the burden of the capitalist recession on to the working class and grassroots classes."
"The Swedish Presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"At the epicentre of this anti-labour attack are wage and pension cuts, the complete demolition of labour relations, workers' rights and social protection and insurance systems and even greater commercialisation of health and education."
"The 'green economy' is being designed so that, on the pretext of combating climate change, new profitable sectors of activity can be opened up for capital."
"The Stockholm programme is endeavouring, in the name of combating terrorism and organised crime, to reinforce the bourgeois political system still further, so that they can combat grassroots reactions and step up repressive measures against immigrants."
"The strategy on the Baltic has paved the way for a more aggressive approach by the euro-unifying monopolies in the countries on the eastern borders of the ΕU, in a bid to strengthen their position in the imperialist competition."
"Using 'guarantees' as a smoke screen and blatant coercion, they are trying to grab the Irish vote in order to implement the anti-grassroots Treaty of Lisbon."
"1."
"Election of Quaestors of Parliament (first, second and third ballots)"
"- Before the vote"
"(DE) Mr President, I think you need to explain something."
"We are at present conducting a test."
"In this test we can only vote for two people - for example Pavarotti and Montserrat Caballé."
"Later, however, in the vote for the quaestors we will be able to vote for five people."
"I just wanted to reiterate this as it has confused many Members."
"It is only in this test that we can vote for two people, afterwards in the real vote it will be five."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from expressing my thanks for putting Pavarotti first, I should like to say something."
"After we have marked with crosses the two to be voted for, do we have to confirm our vote or leave it as it is?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since not everyone has fully understood the oral explanation before the vote, it would be a good idea to explain again clearly how we vote."
"I believe that the outcome of the vote shows how quickly the procedure has been learnt."
"After the vote"
"In accordance with Rule 16 and Rule 15(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the order of precedence of the Quaestors shall be determined by the order in which they were elected."
"The composition of the new Bureau shall be notified to the Presidents of the Institutions of the European Communities."
"2."
"Numerical strength of committees"
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."
"(For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Iran (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Iran."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, it is an honour to be able to stand here for the first time."
"I expect to be here numerous times during the coming six months to address different issues."
"The issue on our agenda at this time is Iran."
"Before going into the substance of that issue, let me just express our heartfelt condolences to Iran on the occasion of the tragic accident earlier today."
"We sincerely regret the loss of life and express our sympathy with all of those affected by this tragedy."
"The issue of Iran is obviously very high up on the Swedish Presidency's agenda."
"That has to do with the outcome of the election and the question marks - to put it very mildly - that were raised after that election, as well as the political developments that we have seen since then."
"I think you are all aware of the fact that the European Union has taken a very strong and a very principled stand when it comes to these events."
"We have reiterated that questions over the conduct of elections are issues for the Iranian authorities to truly investigate and clarify."
"We have also been very clear in our response to what we have seen happening on the streets of Tehran."
"We have condemned the crackdown, the violence and the use of force that we have seen against peaceful demonstrations; we condemn the crackdown against journalists, media outlets, communications and protestors."
"Those are contrary not only to the norms and values that we represent but also, obviously, to the wishes for a more open and more reform-oriented society expressed by so many Iranians."
"That being said, we remain in our principled policy of wishing another, a better, a new relationship with the nation of Iran."
"It is a rich nation that has much to contribute to the development of the world and the development of its own region, and we would hope that at some point in time - hopefully not too distant - there will be that possibility for a truly new relationship."
"Before concluding, let me just note one issue that has been occupying us quite a lot, and that is that the Iranian authorities did detain a number of personalities who are staff members of European missions, as well as some European nationals."
"We have been in constant touch with the Iranian authorities over these issues."
"We consider possible accusations levelled against them to be baseless, and I can assure you that we will continue to engage with the Iranian authorities in all the ways we can until these issues are resolved in a satisfactory manner - that is, that the persons in question are released."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is my first opportunity to congratulate all the honourable Members on their election to the new European Parliament."
"I can say, on behalf of the Commission, that we very much look forward to a constructive cooperation with you, including of course on some of the most pressing international challenges that we face, and the subject of today's debate is certainly one of those."
"My colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner is travelling this week and so I have offered and have been delighted to be able to speak on her behalf in Parliament today."
"This Parliament plays an important part in maintaining and developing relations between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"Exchange visits between Parliament's Iran delegation and members of the Majlis have already played an important role in increasing mutual understanding."
"Parliament has also played its part in setting up several instruments that serve as an important basis for EU activities in Iran, and we in the Commission hope to continue to make good use of these in the years ahead."
"Today's debate was prompted by the recent Iranian presidential elections and the subsequent events."
"While, as the Presidency has said, the evolution of Iran's politics and policies are chiefly a matter for the citizens of Iran, there can be no doubt of the broader significance, and it is right that we should follow these developments closely."
"The European Union has taken very clear positions on the situation in Iran following the presidential elections and has remained united in these positions."
"We have expressed full respect for the sovereignty of Iran, but have stressed our deep concern about the post-election violence, as we would when lives are lost or rights are put at risk in any country."
"Allegations of European interference in the Iranian elections or any involvement in the protests which followed are unfounded."
"However, suppression of peaceful demonstrations, arbitrary detentions and severe censorship of the media constitute violations of human rights which cannot be considered matters confined to the domestic affairs of any country."
"In spite of the current delicate situation in Iran, the Commission believes strongly in maintaining a dialogue."
"That was the case before the elections, and it remains the case now."
"The European Union and Iran have many common and pressing interests, including the fight against drug trafficking and support to Afghan refugees."
"These demand our continued attention and cooperation, and we hope that Iran will share this view."
"The Commission continues to search for ways to deploy Community instruments in constructive activities in Iran."
"We can increase mutual understanding by continuing, for instance, our cooperation through Erasmus Mundus academic exchanges."
"We are convinced that the European Union should keep all available channels of communication open with Iran."
"We should strive for engagement with Iran at all levels."
"When possible and prudent, we stand ready to continue and expand cooperation in the future."
"Our present differences with the Government of Iran are many; some are very serious."
"We call on the Government of Iran to join us in trying to find solutions to our differences through dialogue."
"It is only through discussing the challenges that lie between us in a spirit of mutual respect that we can hope to overcome them."
"Europe has never closed the door to such discussions, and it remains open today."
"Finally, I join with the Presidency in expressing condolences to the families of Iranians and Armenians involved in the tragedy of the plane crash today."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I want to reflect the tone of the debate in the extraordinary meeting of the outgoing Committee on Foreign Affairs, which met last Wednesday because there was no time to convene the new committee."
"Everyone knows the facts all too well, so I will not dwell on that."
"The Union has a duty to stress the universality of human rights, to follow up human rights violations in Iran very closely and to take Iran to task for the brutality and violence."
"Last week we, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Delegation for relations with Iran, met with representatives of the civil society of Iran, and these are aspects that seem to us extremely important."
"We fully endorse the statements and positions taken so far by the Presidency, Council and Commission, but we are also asking the Council to ensure that EU Member States and their ambassadors in Tehran are fully complying with EU guidelines on human rights defenders and on the prevention of torture."
"We should also convey to the Commission our insistence that all available means should be deployed."
"We should support and strengthen civil society organisations in Iran, notably via the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, and deploy all efforts for renewed engagement with Iranian civil society in such uncontroversial areas as the fight against narcotraffic, refugee issues, academic exchanges, and visits to Europe by journalists, to name but a few."
"They could help to further people-to-people contacts and lead to improved freedom of expression in the country."
"Pressure on human rights, yes, but no isolation!"
"Dialogue, even if a very difficult dialogue."
"We are going through a very difficult and tense period with Iran."
"The crucial nuclear question is on hold, and we ask the question: what is the way forward?"
"Well, sanctions are one possible measure being explored."
"We really believe the Union must find a way to re-engage in dialogue with Iran on all these issues."
"The need to find ways of building fresh trust and to create a strong diplomatic process has never been greater than now."
"We should offer our full support to the Council and the Commission in their efforts."
"In turn, we, the European Parliament, must continue with our efforts to strengthen the parliamentary diplomacy aspect of our relations with Iran through our strengthened links with the Majlis."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, whatever people feel about the outcome of the Iranian elections, there is no doubt that tens - hundreds - of people have been injured, tens of people have been killed in the protests that have taken place since the elections in that country, and thousands of people appear to have been detained as political prisoners."
"This entire Chamber should therefore have no hesitation in condemning those abuses of human rights, as it should condemn the obstructions to free journalism that have taken place since the elections."
"We should also, as Mr Saryusz-Wolski mentioned concerning the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, recognise that one of the best ways of determining a free and fair election is to invite election monitors to observe the process, and this European Union has got a fine record of doing that."
"We should note in this Chamber today that the Commission on our behalf did not have the confidence that they could do an independent, fair and objective job and therefore we have proper reason to say that we have no confidence in the election results."
"Our hearts go out to the Iranians who have been injured, detained or had their human rights abused."
"Our thoughts are foremost with them, but I also ask this Chamber not to forget the Iranian who was an employee of the British Embassy."
"He has been detained and is charged in a completely unjustified way with fomenting the protests."
"Our hearts go out too to the French student who was detained by the Iranian authorities."
"We should praise our colleagues in the Swedish Presidency who have stood by those countries and who have ensured concerted action by the European Union in response and ask them to continue it."
"Finally, I am ashamed that in this debate the British National Party will speak for the first time, with an MEP who last Friday described Islam as 'a cancer that should be removed from Europe by chemotherapy'."
"That does not represent British people's views; that is not Europe's attitude towards Islam."
"We should stand up against that as we stand up against unfairness internationally."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Iran is a large country with a large and predominantly young population, a long and eventful history and an impressive culture."
"What is more, Iran is located in one of the most sensitive areas on the planet."
"For all these reasons, but also out of compassion for our fellow human beings, let us not be indifferent to the goings-on in Iran."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is not in favour of regime change by force."
"We do believe, however, that all the peoples of the world, including the Iranian people, must be entitled to choose their own leaders and to replace them when they cease to make the grade."
"Elections under Iran's current regime do not meet international standards for free and fair elections, a situation that was no different in the most recent presidential elections."
"Yet even within the tight restrictions in place in Iran, large swathes of the population refused to accept the official results and took to the streets in protest."
"The Iranian people were not convinced by the extremely limited review of the results and the protests therefore continued."
"The protests were put down in a particularly violent way and the prosecutions are still going on."
"We firmly denounce these prosecutions and we call on the Iranian authorities to bring them to an immediate end and to release all those taken into custody."
"An immediate end must also be brought to the prosecutions of foreign journalists, NGO workers and the Iranian staff of foreign embassies in Tehran."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commission, a regime that turns on its own people and its own youth in this way loses all legitimacy, not just at home, but internationally as well."
"It is therefore particularly tragic that these dramatic developments should take place at a time when the president of the United States has expressed his willingness to enter into dialogue with Iran."
"Iran is on the verge of missing a historic opportunity to take the place on the world stage that its history and culture deserve."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when a people wants to free itself, it inspires our admiration and our solidarity."
"Such is the case for the Iranian people."
"It is true that those elections effectively ended before they began, but, even in those elections, we saw that the people of Iran were able to find the Achilles heel so as to express their desire for freedom and democracy."
"It is true that it is in our interest for the dialogue to be maintained with the Iranian - terrorist - power; no one disputes that."
"At the same time, however, we cannot simply move on to the business of the day."
"What took place in Tehran is absolutely horrible."
"Torture is a daily occurrence in Iranian prisons, but not only for UK nationals."
"Iranian men and women are tortured daily in these prisons, too."
"Therefore, Europe must raise its voice."
"I know that it is difficult to strike a balance between the interests and the protection of the Iranian people and our own interests, which are not always identical."
"However, even if it is complicated, it is important to stress that we show solidarity towards the Iranian people every day."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to analyse the part played by Nokia and Siemens and the responsibility of European weapons in the repression of the Iranian people."
"It is, after all, unthinkable that it should be large European companies that have enabled the Iranian Government to suppress the freedom and the desire for freedom of the Iranian people."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, while we sit here debating the recent uprising in Iran, do we realise that over 50 of the student leaders, the protestors who were arrested, have been taken out and hanged by the Iranian authorities, that over 200 people were killed on the streets, including Neda, who has become an international and very potent symbol of the brutality of that fascist regime against the people of Iran?"
"And, while we continue to enjoy our place as the biggest trading partner with the Iranian Government, do we seriously think that money is more important than lives?"
"Why are we not prepared to put tougher sanctions in place?"
"Why do we not, as a Parliament, scrap our Delegation for relations with Iran, which in any case in the last five years became nothing more than a compliant mouthpiece of the Iranian Embassy in Brussels and brought shame on the EU institutions?"
"Scrap it and let us start talking tough with the Iranian authorities."
"It is the only language they understand."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left is deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in Iran."
"We, too, condemn in the strongest possible terms the brutal mistreatment of demonstrators."
"We are extremely concerned about the fate of numerous people who were detained and call for their immediate release and we also believe that the European Parliament as a whole should do this."
"We are also critical of comments in media and governmental circles in other states which exploit the legitimate protests of the Iranian citizens."
"Not even the most recent developments in Iran justify plans for military action against Iranian nuclear installations."
"My group rejects such strategies."
"We therefore welcome the clear statement by President Obama, who has refused to give Israel the green light for an attack on Iran."
"The US President also believes in diplomacy."
"Iran is a sovereign state."
"Its people alone have the right to decide on changes to its society."
"The government of a sovereign state must openly accept the desire for change and drive through a political solution."
"Mr President, congratulations on your election."
"The repression of citizens who contest the election results, the censorship of the media and the persecution of the opposition confirm the absence of democracy in Iran."
"We find similar situations in other countries too, such as China, but there is further cause for concern in Iran's case."
"Firstly, because of its hegemonic ambitions, which manifest themselves in its interference in neighbouring countries, such as in the Basra region of Iraq, and in its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon."
"Secondly, because of the strong influence that religious extremism exerts on the political power of the Islamic Republic."
"A few hours ago a singer - an Iranian singer - was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for defamation of religion, and 12 Sunnis were sentenced to death."
"President Ahmadinejad has declared on many occasions that the destruction of the State of Israel is his main policy objective."
"Moreover, Iran's desire to develop a nuclear programme outside international controls is alarming."
"In view of the fact that Iran is one of the largest producers of gas and oil, its real objective appears to be to develop nuclear weapons for the obvious purpose of being able to blackmail countries in the region and the entire international community."
"An intense effort is therefore required from the entire European political community to strike the right balance between opposing the Ayatollahs' regime and supporting the moderate and reformist Iranian element that exists and is active."
"In this regard the financial resources from the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights could be used to support all of the victims of the current oppression."
"No political intervention can be effective, however, without all of the countries of Europe uniting and acting as one."
"Mr President, as a human rights lawyer with 20 years' experience internationally, let me ask this Parliament, in order to have legitimacy and credibility, to scrutinise the human rights situation in the Third World and other non-EU countries, but also, please, to take a much closer look at the situation of democracy, the rule of law and human rights within the EU, in particular in my own country, Hungary."
"Let me share with you a couple of facts."
"On 23 October 2006, there was a major demonstration with about 100 000 people in commemoration of the 1956 revolution."
"This was organised by the largest opposition party, Fidesz, which is well represented here in the EPP, and basically they won the elections this year in Hungary."
"It was a middle-class crowd of families, elderly people, children, and the brutal Hungarian police brutally attacked this crowd with tear gas, with rubber bullets, with policemen on horseback, causing severe injuries to several hundred people."
"On the same occasion several hundred people were illegally detained and tortured in prison."
"Ever since that date, throughout the last three years right up to the most recent days, when 216 peaceful demonstrators were illegally detained and brutalised by the police, on every single occasion when there was an anti-government protest, not in Iran, not in China, not in Honduras, but in an EU country, Hungary, the same things happened: mass police brutalities, illegal detentions."
"May I ask you to please join forces with me and, regardless of political affiliations, help to find out what happened, to find who was responsible, to try to do justice to the victims and please, as the European Union, to try to put an end to these mass violations of human rights within the EU, in order to have the credibility and legitimacy to scrutinise the human rights situation in Iran or whichever country outside the Union."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I am here to talk about Iran, and I would first like to join in expressing my condolences for the victims of this morning's plane crash."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the ideas that have already been expressed regarding the situation in Iran following the electoral process."
"This process was neither free nor fair, and has allowed President Ahmadinejad and the most radical sectors of the regime to remain in power, violently repressing demonstrators, preventing journalists from doing their job and seeking to hold a supposed external conspiracy responsible for internal disorder, while using misinformation to conceal the truth."
"What is certain is that the Iranian regime has been seriously damaged, both internally and in terms of its external image."
"Moreover, the oligarchy that has enjoyed power in recent decades is now divided, which will affect the stability of the regime."
"At the same time, discontent among the people will continue to grow, especially if oil prices do not rise again and consequently the economic situation does not improve."
"The European Union needs to maintain a united front and continue to condemn the abuses committed in Iran."
"It should demand greater respect for human rights, and we also need to look at how we can help civil society, in particular those sectors that want democratic pluralism and respect for human rights for their country."
"We should not disappoint those sectors that are looking to the West, including the European Union."
"However, with regard to Iran we must also not forget the threat that its nuclear programme represents, as it is having a destabilising effect on the region and on non-proliferation in general."
"It is essential that the European Union and the United States continue to cooperate on this matter, and I am sure that this will be a priority for the Swedish Presidency."
"We need to fully involve Russia and China, which are permanent members of the Security Council."
"Their support is essential in order for a negotiated solution to be found to this grave threat, which requires unity and firmness from the international community."
"I therefore welcome the resolution adopted in this respect last week at the G8."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the events of the last few weeks have openly demonstrated the extremism and radical nature of the current Iranian leaders; it is clear that the international community cannot afford for them to obtain nuclear weapons."
"(ES) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I was going to start my first speech to this plenary by welcoming the fact that the debate on the situation in Iran was not brought on by Iran's prominence in the media, which has been superseded in turn by China, Honduras, the G20, etc."
"Unfortunately, the recent executions of Sunni militants in Iran have brought the country and its human rights violations back to the front page of the newspapers."
"However, I do not think that it should be what is in the news that inspires what is on Parliament's agenda in terms of external policy, but rather Parliament's own sense of responsibility and its considered and coherent response, in line with its growing role in the European Union's external policy, especially in the field of human rights."
"This role, Mr President, involves monitoring the consistent use of all the instruments that the European Union has in this field and, in the case of Iran, we should not keep the dialogue on nuclear weapons entirely separate from the complete absence of political dialogue on human rights."
"Structured dialogue on human rights has been suspended since 2004."
"We do not have a cooperation and trade agreement on which to hang a democratic clause, we have not managed to send an electoral observation mission, and the funds of the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights are minute."
"In Parliament and in the whole of the European Union we need to be more effective in using the instruments that we have available to us and that we have equipped ourselves with. Some in this very House and in the Iranian opposition have called for relations with the Iranian regime to be completely broken off and for the new government not to be recognised."
"We strongly condemn the political repression and the stifling of freedom of expression in Iran, but we do not think that we should relinquish being a force in the defence and protection of human rights, democracy and the fight against poverty in the world."
"In order to do this, Mr President, we need dialogue, negotiation and diplomacy, and we need to seek out common interests and build an alliance of civilisations."
"I call on the Presidency of the Council to do this."
"(DA) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has discussed the violations of human rights by Iran on many occasions and we are, in fact, doing so again today."
"We will not change the appalling behaviour of the dictators by words alone."
"It is time for tangible action."
"The brutal slaughter of a people who hunger after freedom and who have courageously taken to the streets must cause us to take on some of the responsibility for bringing down this criminal regime."
"This regime has no place in the 21st century."
"European governments must report the Iranian regime to the UN Security Council and demand that the perpetrators, primarily Ali Khamenei and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, be brought before an international court."
"The Iranian people want freedom and we must support the call for free elections under UN supervision."
"Parliament cannot maintain its delegation with Iran, which, at its last meeting, was turned into a tool by the dictatorial regime to influence our parliament."
"We must demonstrate that we do not cooperate with dictatorships."
"Mr President, last year I served as a monitor at commemorations for the 1956 revolution in Budapest."
"I can confirm that Dr Morvai is right to criticise those who fret about Iran while ignoring human rights abuses here in Europe."
"I trust that no ECR Group members here will be hypocritical enough to condemn Iran for the use of violence in elections when David Cameron is among the sponsors of Unite Against Fascism, an organisation of far-left criminals which routinely deploys intimidation and violence against nationalist dissidents in Britain."
"The same is true of five current Labour, Lib Dem and Tory MEPs, marked with the shame of supporting the use of British taxpayers' money to support their own militia, which breaks up opposition meetings and attacks their opponents with bricks, darts and claw hammers."
"But my main point is this: however well meaning, and even justified, criticisms of Iran made here may be, they will be exploited as war propaganda by the powerful vested interests that stand to gain from a military attack on that country."
"Neocons, oil companies, construction corporations and the Wahabi mullahs of Saudi Arabia all want to see the sovereign state of Iran destroyed by an aggressive war."
"Not even European liberals are naive enough to fall for lies about weapons of mass destruction again, so human rights are being drafted in as a new casus belli."
"Do not add the voice of this place to the warmongers' chorus for a third illegal and counterproductive attack by the West on the Muslim world."
"Or, if you must, do not leave the war - which hypocritical rhetoric will help to justify and unleash - to the usual brave British cannon fodder: 18-year-old boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne."
"Instead, send your own sons to come home in boxes or without their legs, their arms and their sanity - or mind your own business."
"(PL) Mr President, the death of innocent people is always a tragedy."
"If, however, they die in defence of values such as freedom or truth, we can say that their suffering is not in vain - as is the case with the recent victims in Iran."
"Things have become very bad, when a regime shoots at demonstrators, puts opponents in prison, and tortures and kills them."
"The only source of hope and optimism is that these events may make politicians and public opinion across the world aware of the true nature of the Iranian regime, which is capable of actions which are very far removed from the minimum standards of the modern world."
"This regime has blood on its hands."
"We should remember this, and we should work towards changing a state of affairs which we cannot accept."
"In situations like this the same question always comes up: what can we do?"
"Well, we can support the demands and proposals which have already been expressed."
"Firstly, the Iranian authorities must stop using violence towards those who have a different opinion than the regime."
"In the case of countries like Iran the observance of basic human rights should be monitored and guaranteed by the international community."
"Secondly, a free and fair election should be held in Iran, in which all candidates should be allowed to stand, and not just those who have obtained permission to stand."
"Incidentally, those who are making these decisions about the right to stand in elections do not themselves have a democratic mandate."
"The fairness of the election should be verified by independent external observers - otherwise the election will be pointless."
"Thirdly, we should do everything to ensure that the solutions for Iran are peaceful and political, and that means that we should support those Iranians who want fundamental changes in their country, changes which will mean that Iran will be governed by those who win fair elections, and Iran itself will cease to be a threat to world security."
"The leader of the Iranian opposition in exile, Mrs Rajavi, has said that what has happened in Iran is the beginning of the end of the regime."
"I sincerely hope that Mrs Rajavi is right."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Swedish Presidency for its observations before our debate, which I feel were balanced and also able to make us understand the responsibility that we are being asked to fulfil."
"I should like, in this sense, to make an observation that stems from my having seen, as so many others have, on television screens everywhere, the crowds that in some way stirred up the protest of the last few days."
"However, while it is true that Iran is a theocracy in which fundamentalism has shaped its plan to wield power by pretending that it is in the name of God, in recent days we have also seen people take to the streets and actually cry out 'God is great'."
"What a difference!"
"This difference in looks, in the will that these people have expressed, and in the determination not to be violent, makes us realise that, in Iran, the love of freedom and of truth, the love for one's own people, and the love and regard for everyone is not dead."
"Thirty years of theocracy, thirty years of systematic human destruction have not been enough to wipe out this memory that is in the hearts of each of us."
"It is to this that we owe loyalty."
"It is to this fact, to this love of truth and to this love of freedom that we owe our unconditional devotion, and it is this that should heighten the responsibility of everyone, because asking the European institutions to be strong, to be determined and to make their voices heard is, first and foremost, not a demand by Parliament for geopolitical prominence, it is pointing out that, insofar as it represents this political project that we call united Europe, the love of freedom and of truth that exists in all of those who demonstrated in recent days must not be forsaken by Europe's institutions."
"Mr President, a crucial change has taken place in Iran."
"Our first conclusions, therefore, should be that Iran is not and will not be the same again."
"It is because millions of Iranians have refused to be hostages of their clerical rulers."
"They have demonstrated an amazing courage in challenging the dictatorship."
"The issue, therefore, is not about rigging so-called elections more than usual."
"This time, blatantly rigged votes provided an outlet for a popular protest the experts outside Iran could not or were not willing to expect."
"This reminds me of the situation 20 years ago in Eastern Europe: while the Western governments were prepared for a long-term accommodation and pragmatic coexistence with the Soviet totalitarian system, suddenly millions of hostages of the Communist regime became active: they challenged the system, which was brought to a sudden end."
"Therefore, it is important to realise that the European approach to Iran cannot remain the same - just turning a blind eye to routinely rigged elections and systematic repression."
"It is estimated that during 30 years of dictatorship more than five million people have been imprisoned, more than 200 000 tortured to death and recently more than 200 killed."
"The EU governments have been too hesitant in condemning these atrocious crimes and to make the regime bear responsibility for its behaviour."
"If we are serious about protecting the rights of Iranian citizens, we need to be prepared to cause the dictators real pain."
"What does this mean?"
"We should, for example, ban any of the leaders of the regime from travelling to the EU; we should recall our ambassadors from Iran as a gesture of our indignation; and free elections can take place in Iran only under UN supervision."
"Mr President, as the situation in Iran escalates and the violation of democracy also presents a danger to the stability of the whole region, we have to express our concern and condemnation - but declarations must not only be symbolic and empty."
"Some European leaders are talking about new sanctions to be imposed on Iran, but a discussion is needed right now on the promotion of democracy at grass-root level in this country."
"I am Polish, and we in Eastern Europe know how important these types of actions are for the establishment of democracy."
"A promotion should be adapted to the political and economic situation in a given country, but previous EU experience in the promotion of democracy in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe has to be reviewed and evaluated in order to see what should be done in Iran, what can be done in Iran and what is effective under given circumstances in this country."
"I also want to remind you that, if the EU wants to be credible, it also has to undertake some measures in Moldova."
"Soon we will face a new test - on 29 July - with the elections in Moldova."
"The EU has to do everything it can to ensure free and fair democratic elections in this country."
"It is not enough to talk about support for democracy: we in the European Parliament and European institutions have to be more active in that respect."
"(PL) Mr President, it certainly is necessary to monitor the progress of the electoral process in Iran, although the beginning of a solution to the conflict should be a declaration by the authorities in Iran that they will stop using force, and that they will free the imprisoned opposition activists, defenders of human rights, journalists, demonstrators and citizens of other countries who are currently being blamed for the situation which exists in Iran."
"We should, of course, uphold absolute respect for the sovereignty of Iran, but we should also remind Tehran that it is obliged to observe the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"I would also like to express concern at Iran's nuclear programme."
"Tehran is entitled to a nuclear programme used for peaceful purposes, but it is also obliged to restore the confidence of the international community that Iranian nuclear activity is exclusively peaceful in nature."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to express my deep regret about the tragic aircraft accident which occurred today in the province of Qazvin in Iran."
"The debate here today is a necessity following the events which ensued after the elections on 12 June."
"However, I think that we must hold it within the right framework."
"We must not send out the wrong message."
"Any direct or indirect link between these events and the question of the nuclear programme is misleading."
"We must be clear that our subject today is the situation of democracy and human rights in Iran."
"Talk about new sanctions will not under any circumstances help to resolve the serious problems of the Iranian people."
"Democracy cannot be imposed by such means."
"In the European Union we need to step up efforts for democratisation and respect for fundamental freedoms, but by setting this issue within the framework of a substantial political dialogue and by strengthening our contacts with civil society."
"We also need to call for further investigation into complaints of fraud in the election process and to emphasise once again that the right of peaceful protest is an inalienable right of the people of every country."
"We must therefore roundly condemn the violence from this tribune here today and call for respect for freedom of speech and expression to be applied in practice in Iran, as in every other country in the world."
"(DE) Mr President, I think it is good that we are having this debate in the first week of the new Parliament."
"Unfortunately, our group chairmen have rejected a motion for a resolution."
"I ask myself who we are actually paying attention to here."
"A resolution would have been helpful to the dissidents in Iran if we had confirmed to them in a tangible statement that what was officially described as a presidential election did not in any way meet international standards of democracy because most of the candidates were rejected by the Guardian Council and because even those who were permitted to stand cannot be considered to have been given equal conditions."
"From a political perspective we can therefore conclude without reservation that the results of the election as announced did not represent the will of the Iranian people."
"Let us, as the EU, actively use our instruments for democracy and human rights, support the living civil society or even lawyers like Shirin Ebadi, for example, who is standing up for the Bahai detainees there."
"I believe this is the policy that can be successful at the moment, even in the short term."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, last week - to my great pleasure as a new Member - in a meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee we heard a talk by Mr Makhmalbaf, an Iranian film director, who told us very plainly that before this election Iran had 20% democracy, but after the election, which in his opinion was a sham, there was absolutely no democracy left."
"I also agree with this description - it most certainly was a sham election, which, with large-scale electoral fraud, robbed the majority of Iranian people, who had called for change, of this right."
"President-in-Office of the Council there is one thing in particular that interests me: in the middle of August the inauguration of the 're-elected' Mr Ahmadinejad will take place."
"What is currently being discussed in the Council and also in the Member States?"
"Will the European Union and the Member States be officially represented at this inauguration?"
"I certainly hope not, as I do not think that there should be any official representation of the European Union or the Member States after this election sham, and as much as I would advocate further dialogue, no one should officially represent the European Union at this inauguration."
"What is your position on this?"
"How is it currently being dealt with?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when debating foreign policy issues, such as today's issue involving Iran, there is always the risk, as we know, of lagging slightly behind the events taking place."
"However, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, if it wants to, can play an important role in urging Europe and the international community to take the current events seriously and to implement all of the initiatives needed to ensure that the process of introducing a democratic system in Iran can actually take place."
"Following the close attention paid by the international public to the post-election period in Iran and the street demonstrations that the Iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence, it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country."
"Being realistic about things does not mean taking the Iran issue off the agenda."
"It is also up to us to keep this level of attention high, and it is also up to the Swedish Presidency - which I thank for the points it has made today - to promote a strong initiative, together with the United States, Russia and other countries, in order to change the way in which issues in Iran, from democratic rights to the nuclear issue itself, develop."
"(ES) Mr President, in the last few weeks we have been moved by the repeated demonstrations of heroism and the bravery of the people of Iran, who have confronted the machine guns and truncheons of their tyrants with their bare hands."
"The large numbers of women leading the demonstrations is an unmistakeable expression of the Iranians' determination to live in a true democracy."
"President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union's response has been too weak and too fainthearted."
"We need to send out a very strong political signal to express our absolute rejection of this intolerable theocratic dictatorship."
"The solution has been voiced very well by the leader of the resistance in exile, Massoud Rajavi: the Supreme Leader needs to be deposed, and a temporary assembly of experts needs to call free elections under international supervision."
"Anything else will be a waste of time and will prolong this disgrace."
"(NL) May I start by warmly welcoming the new President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Bildt."
"I am aware, of course, that he is about to face a number of very busy months, as the problems of the world are going to be resting, more than anywhere, on his big, broad shoulders."
"Mr President, when it comes to Iran I have the following points to make."
"First of all, the Iranian regime is unpredictable."
"Secondly, I note that there are, in fact, hairline cracks beginning to appear in the regime, specifically in religious circles."
"Thirdly, it is my observation that the regime supports everything that is bad or involves corruption in this world - be it in the Middle East or in Pakistan."
"Fourthly, I would point out that dialogue really does not provide any help and, finally, I note the citizens rightly want more freedom and that they must have our - Europeans' - support in this regard."
"I would then like to ask you, Mr Bildt, why has the Council been unable to produce a tougher statement and why have we only listened to a couple of countries that always want to act in defiance of the human rights situation?"
"(ES) Mr President, I would of course like to start by condemning the events in Iran and the repression by the Iranian Government, but I want to join with those who have advocated that we should combine pressure from the European institutions with maintaining dialogue and the negotiation process."
"History and experience have shown us that breaking off all relations with authoritarian regimes does nothing to improve living conditions for the people who are suffering under such regimes and, at the same time, it weakens the position of those of us who are defending respect for democracy and human rights in such countries."
"I therefore think that we should use all the tools that the European Union has to put pressure on the Iranian regime, starting with this Parliament, but at the same time that we should also maintain negotiations and dialogue - dialogue that puts pressure on the regime - especially through the High Representative, Mr Solana."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Iran today represents the principal threat to international security and stability: on the one hand, by violating the United Nations resolutions it is pursuing its objective of equipping itself with atomic weapons and, on the other, it is repeating its desire to physically destroy the State of Israel."
"I hope that Europe, with the Swedish Presidency, can send out a clear message to Iran in general, indicating that the non-negotiable values of the right to life, human dignity and the freedom of choice cannot be separated from the development of bilateral relations and that, in particular, it can make it clear that the State of Israel's right to exist is non-negotiable and that Europe, which has lived through the Holocaust on its own territory, will not allow a second holocaust of the State and the people of Israel."
"(FR) Mr President, I wish to take the floor to call on our Parliament to declare itself clearly in favour of financial and technical sanctions against Iran."
"Of course, there are a great many arguments against sanctions, since they will have consequences for the lives of Iranian citizens."
"However, the worst thing for Iranian citizens, Mr President, would not be the shortages caused by these sanctions; the worst thing would be our silence, our failure to act."
"Sanctions, Mr President, would show that we are not indifferent, and I believe that that is crucial."
"That is why, Mr President, our Parliament must demand financial sanctions against Iran."
"Mr President, the appalling Iranian theocratic dictatorship is already guilty of many crimes against its own people: from hanging Baha'is to hanging homosexuals and now apparently hanging 50 innocent protestors."
"So we should hardly be surprised by the mere stealing of an election through wholesale electoral fraud."
"I believe this crack in the regime and the courage of its protesting youth - whom I salute - will eventually bring the whole rotten government down."
"Mr Howitt recently, in another meeting, suggested that we should have sent EU electoral observers from this House to confirm whether fraud had actually taken place."
"No, we must never legitimise any sham election which restricts candidates on the basis of their religious purity and conducts its count behind closed doors."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I have listened very attentively to the different assessments and views expressed."
"This is, as has been pointed out, a most important debate on a most important subject."
"I think it can fairly be said that we stand united in our assessment of what has been happening, what we have seen on the television screens and, more importantly, what we have heard from the people who know even more than what can be seen on the television screens."
"I would like to take issue with someone who said we have not been clear enough."
"If you make a comparison with what the European Union has said, and what every other significant world body of actors has said, there is no question that we are the ones that have been the most clear, the most consistent, the strongest in the words that we have used."
"We would have wished those words to have more of an effect than they already have, but that is often the case."
"But, while words are, nevertheless, important - no question about that - we are discussing primarily what has been happening in Iran since the election on 12 June."
"I think it is important also to focus on what we saw on the television screens before 12 June, because that was suddenly a somewhat different Iran from the one we were used to."
"There was an element within the boundaries of the regime, certainly, of vitality, an element of plurality, an obvious desire for change, for openness, for reform."
"Whether that represented the majority of Iranians or not is very difficult to judge from the outside, but that it was significant is testified not least by the force of the crackdown that we saw after 12 June."
"So in condemning what we have seen after, we should not forget what we saw before and the long-term significance of that."
"I think we are united in what we say and what we think."
"Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Mauro: virtually the same, if we look at what we are assessing."
"But the most difficult thing is not what we say; the most difficult thing is what we do faced with this situation."
"I think we must then operate along two lines."
"The first one is fairly obvious."
"The European Union must be the clear voice for human rights and democracy wherever and under whatever circumstances."
"There might be other factors coming into consideration of policy as well, but it should not dilute in any way from the consistency of our defence for human rights."
"So we must condemn the killings, the use of the death sentence."
"We must call for the release of those detained."
"We must be clear in our call for full respect for the freedom and the rights that are there for every human being in our world."
"Secondly - and I think here there might be some dissent - we must also be prepared to engage."
"I say that, recognising that that is a far more difficult policy than just to stand back, do nothing or try to isolate: that is easy; to engage is difficult."
"Mr Kelam alluded to some of the historical experience we have, with the balancing act that that entails."
"But the fact that we have a certain amount of historical experience in Europe - reflected not the least here - perhaps makes it possible for us to venture along that particular road."
"We should never believe that just a diplomatic dialogue can sort out every issue that has been addressed here: it cannot."
"Other factors will come in to that particular equation."
"But neither should we forget that there are some issues that we have a duty to seek to resolve through diplomatic dialogue."
"I am thinking of the individuals employed at the British Embassy, or the French student and others, that we must deal with now in a dialogue."
"I come from a country where 1% of our citizens have a background in Iran."
"They move back and forth."
"We have consular issues that are of a multitude that is difficult to fathom."
"We need to be prepared to engage, to help individuals in different cases, without believing that that is going to sort out everything at once."
"We have the nuclear dossier that has been alluded to."
"There might be others who believe there are far more simple solutions to that."
"I do not think there is any solution if we do not engage in a true diplomatic dialogue on that."
"Those are other issues that we need to engage on."
"This is obviously going to be more demanding and more difficult in the circumstances that we now have, there is no question about that, and I think the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week highlighted some of the difficult choices and some of the difficult judgements that we have to make in not only the coming weeks, but months - but not very much longer than that."
"Here we must engage - you, us in the Council and us as Europeans - with other significant international actors, not only with Americans with a new and good approach by the Obama Administration, but also engage with others - the UN Security Council, Russia, China, and with the wider world community."
"It is only then that we can hope to be able to start resolving not only the immediate issues, but also the other issues that need to be addressed."
"I am grateful for this debate."
"I think it has highlighted the clear unanimity that we have when it comes to defending our values, but it has also highlighted some of the difficult choices and balancing acts that we have to engage in in the months and years ahead."
"We know what we want to achieve; we must also seek to achieve it."
"But do not think it is going to be easy."
"I can assure you that the Council will continue to be very much engaged with all aspects of this particular dossier."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Mr President, please excuse me, but I have just been given a piece of information, and I should like to share it with the Council and with all my fellow Members."
"Natalia Estemirova, who was a candidate for the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, was kidnapped this morning in Grozny and is being held by unknown kidnappers."
"I call on the Council, the Commission and the MEPs to protest so that Moscow is aware that we are thinking of Natalia Estemirova."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, this is just to put the record straight, as my name was cited by my colleague, Mr Tannock."
"I did not call for EU observers last week and, indeed, earlier in the debate I was very clear in saying that, should the circumstances have justified it, the European Union would have been able to send an observer mission to the Iranian elections."
"However, it was precisely because the Commission did not have the confidence to do this that causes us proper, justified and objective concerns about the conduct of those elections."
"I am sorry that Mr Tannock was not in the Chamber to hear that earlier in the debate, and I hope that I have been able to put the record straight."
"The debate is closed."
"China (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the Council and Commission statements on China."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, another debate of, needless to say, some importance."
"And, although the subject is China, it of course takes place against the background of some significant developments in Xinjiang in the western part of China."
"I know that these events have been followed by many Members of this Parliament as well as our respective national parliaments throughout Europe."
"We have also, as a Council, expressed our concern over the reports on the unrest there and called for restraint on all sides and for the situation to be resolved peacefully."
"I think it is time for us to say that we attach great importance to human rights."
"We also profoundly regret not only the loss of life but the destruction of property and everything else that we have seen happening and we can only condemn those that are responsible for it, whoever they are."
"But let me also take this opportunity to take stock somewhat more widely of our relationship with China, a country with which we have an extraordinary range of complex relationships."
"In fact, when we decided in 2003 to set up those relationships within the framework of a comprehensive strategic partnership, we were committing ourselves to an extremely ambitious enterprise, and this is very much reflected in the broad and wide-ranging relationship which we have with China today."
"Complexity of course brings opportunities."
"It also brings challenges of different sorts."
"What we have tried to do with this relationship is to open it up to the point where we can discuss frankly and openly any concern that we might have on either side."
"The basis for such an open dialogue is the shared interest that we have in developing our relationship, our shared interest in global peace and stability."
"We pursue this through dialogue and through multilateralism."
"We have the annual summit meetings and we have fairly frequent meetings at the level of foreign ministers."
"We also have an intense biannual human rights dialogue and then of course sectoral dialogues on different issues, trade obviously being one of particular importance."
"We also have the annual high-level dialogue on trade and economic issues."
"As you are aware, in 2007 we also launched negotiations for a partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Negotiations are progressing but still there is a potential to increase efforts on both sides in these negotiations."
"We have a very clear interest in developing the relationship with China in all fields, and that entails, as I said, the possibility for an open and frank dialogue, also on issues where our values might be different, and we know that such issues exist, including human rights, including issues like the use of the death sentence; but also to pursue the common interest that, needless to say, we have these days: issues of global financial stability, issues of how to deal with the climate change challenge are important."
"Also important are foreign policy issues, be that the situation we face over the Korean peninsula with the provocation by the DPIK, or the situation in Burma, where we are concerned, obviously, at what we see happening, but our concern also stretches to the situation in Africa and the need to protect the vital sea routes around the Horn of Africa."
"I will not go further into this question now, but wish only to underline the concern that we have over developments, without being able to assess those in every single detail because they are exceedingly complex, our hope that they could be resolved peacefully and our readiness to engage with the Chinese authorities in a frank dialogue on these issues, as well as on the broad range of other interests that we share together and that we need to have a dialogue on."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is a sign of the importance that this House attaches to our strategic relationship with China that this debate has been scheduled during your inaugural session."
"I yet again welcome the opportunity to contribute with a brief outline of the perspective of the Commission on behalf of my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who, I have indicated, is unfortunately travelling this week and cannot be here."
"I do not need to remind this House of the huge progress we have made in relations with China since our first summit, now 10 years ago."
"Economic and trade relations have been transformed, people-to-people contacts are multiplying and we are engaged in dialogue on an ever-increasing range of issues."
"Following the last EU-China Summit in May, negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement are proceeding well and we are able to take advantage of a growing number of high-level contacts, including Prime Minister Wen's highly successful visit to President Barroso earlier this year and the meeting of the high-level economic and trade dialogue which I co-chaired with Vice-Premier Wang Qishan."
"Today we are naturally focused on global challenges, including the economic and financial crisis and climate change, as well as regional issues."
"At the same time, we have strong interests in the situation inside China, where we witness many spectacular achievements but also developments that cause concern."
"China's policy of opening up its economy has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and helped the world progress towards the important Millennium Development Goals."
"Yet China is a huge country with considerable internal challenges and differences between its regions."
"The strength of our strategic partnership also allows for constructive and open exchange of views on issues where Europe and China diverge."
"This can be on aspects of our trade relationship or human rights - for example over Tibet, which I know is of particular interest in this House."
"Recently we expressed strong concern over the unrest in Xinjiang, deplored the loss of life, and expressed our condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims."
"We have called on all parties to show restraint and bring an immediate end to all acts of violence."
"We hope the situation can be resolved peacefully through dialogue without further bloodshed."
"The EU has tried, over the years, to convey to the Chinese authorities its worries over the situation of ethnic minorities in China and to share its own experience, many times painful, on how to address the causes of marginalisation, exclusion and discrimination that those minorities often face."
"We all share the goal of a more open, transparent China adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to address global challenges."
"To achieve this, we must continue to integrate China deeper into the international community and work on the development of our strategic partnership in the spirit of constructive engagement."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the basic substance of what was said by the previous speakers from the Council and Commission."
"I too am of the opinion that we should continue the One China policy to achieve the cohesion of China as a unified state, and that we do not want to jeopardise any of this."
"Of course, we do not permit violence - be it violence by demonstrators under particular circumstances or violence by the state against demonstrators, as was actually the case."
"I wanted to mention this first."
"However, we also need to understand that, in China, the violence of the central government which, in this multi-ethnic state with many cultural differences, does not show a sufficient degree of understanding, will always be a recurring problem."
"This is why greater cultural autonomy, greater opportunities for mobility and opportunities relating to the preservation of identity and language are all prerequisites for all the citizens of a multi-ethnic state to be able to live together under one roof."
"China's history has consisted of a series of break-aways and reunifications with massive campaigns of violence."
"This can be seen again and again throughout China's history."
"China needs to realise that this cannot go on and that it needs to introduce this autonomy."
"The Uighurs are a moderate Sunni minority."
"They pose no direct terrorist threat."
"There is therefore the same danger as we see in Tibet and that is that if China does not enter into agreements with the moderates, there are always young radicals who cannot and do not want to wait any longer."
"Therefore, delaying a solution with regard to identity delays a solution in the long term."
"The Chinese Government is extremely ill advised to talk only of terrorists, to claim that these people want to destroy the unity of the state and to say that outside forces like Al-Qaeda and others are behind this."
"I do not believe that this is a solution for this country and therefore we should make it clear that we do not accept such a policy."
"All this should be understood under the premise that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the Chinese people are completely right to ask us why the European Parliament has put the situation in China on the agenda of the first part-session of its new mandate."
"Our answer must be clear: this is because China is very important to us and not because we think that our role is to teach China or to impose our views on how sensitive internal problems of this country should be solved."
"It is precisely because China is so important to us that we should pay close attention to any event affecting its internal stability and any event that could become a threat to its security."
"This time the context was given by the multi-ethnic realities in the Xinjiang region and the aspirations of the Uighur predominant ethnic group to autonomy."
"Such contexts are always sensitive and, therefore, respect for human and minority rights leading towards the sense of dignity and security for both minority and majority is important."
"Minority rights, however, should not be an excuse for, and they could not excuse, the separatist policies, the extremist means to promote those policies and certainly not the killing of peaceful civilians belonging to a minority or to an ethnic community."
"While asking for full respect for human rights and minority rights, while expressing compassion for all victims of these rights, while asking for clarification concerning terrorist, religious, extremist and separatist dimensions of these events, the European Parliament should offer its assistance to the Chinese Government and society in order to cope with these difficult realities, which are also a problem in some of our countries."
"While asking the Chinese Government to refrain from the excessive use of power, we have also to ask everybody in the world to refrain from using minority rights as a means for promoting geopolitical goals."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this House has long been critical of the People's Republic of China for its treatment of ethnic minorities."
"The Uighurs of Xinjiang Province have suffered more than most, particularly since the occupation of East Turkestan by the People's Republic of China in 1949."
"The People's Republic claims that it does not seek territorial expansion."
"History shows that in East Turkestan, Tibet and Taiwan, under Communist rule it has sought to rule and to subjugate."
"That is the reason why the European Union must not lift the arms embargo on China."
"For a European Prime Minister to refer to the reaction to the latest unrest as 'genocide' is perhaps an exaggeration, but for the People's Republic to complain of interference in internal affairs betrays a world view which is touchingly antiquated."
"If the contours of the world economy are drawn in the computer campuses of West Coast America, in the call centres of India, in the factories of China, if major decisions can be communicated from Beijing to Brussels in a nanosecond, we have become truly one global community, and there is no room in this community for repression or subjugation on the basis of race or religion or ethnicity; no room for Islamophobia or for anti-Semitism or any other kind of hatred."
"China's problems stem in this instance from the greying of the middle kingdom."
"They need more young people to work elsewhere, similar to the problems we face here in the European Union."
"I saw this when I visited Urumqi four years ago."
"But the People's Republic will find that it needs policies to protect economic migrants, policies to recognise the legitimate demands of ethnic minorities, just as we do."
"Here, Mr Bildt, is a role for the European Union."
"We know that as democracies mature, so they become more willing to allow people self-government and self-determination."
"Indeed, the biggest problems in Europe are found in the younger democracies, like Spain and Hungary."
"We need to help the Chinese people, who are quite capable of living in democracy - as Taiwan and Hong Kong show - to match their growing economic strength with a growing political maturity in developing democracy and help them develop the policies to match, policies like Erasmus Mundus, policies of which the Commissioner has spoken to increase people-to-people exchange."
"I am convinced that the European Union can play an important role in working with China to these ends."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I condemn the violence on both sides, both on the part of the Han Chinese and on the part of the Uighurs, and I mourn for all the innocent victims."
"However, this is not a conflict where the two sides are equal."
"The Uighurs are a suppressed people numbering only nine million."
"I believe that the minorities policy in the People's Republic of China has failed."
"The society is also not harmonious as the Communist Party of China claims."
"In Xinjiang, the region of the Uighurs, there is just as little cultural autonomy as in Tibet."
"There is no real self-government, even if these regions are referred to as being autonomous and above all - and this is crucial for the younger generation in particular - the Uighurs do not have the same social and economic rights as the rest of the population."
"However, the Communist Party of China recognises only one charge, only one monotonously repeated charge, and that is of criminal separatism."
"Anyone who promotes human rights and democracy in China runs the risk of being declared a criminal and a separatist."
"However, the People's Republic of China needs to understand that it is only with the guarantee of minority rights that there will be any real chance of internal peace."
"Only by granting equal rights will China have peaceful internal development and acceptance of this country."
"I have one last very important comment to make to the Swedish Presidency."
"Yes, it is true that we have an interest in a strategic partnership with China on account of climate policy and general foreign policy matters."
"However, we cannot sacrifice human rights and our criticism of the situation regarding human rights in China for the sake of a strategic interest."
"Our strategic policy with regard to China must instead include a clear statement regarding the minorities policy and the violation of human rights in China."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, for centuries the Uighurs have eked out a perilous living in an inhospitable part of a vast country."
"Most of them are peaceful followers of Islam."
"However, sadly some of the local population in recent years have become increasingly radicalised by terrorists in league with Al-Qaida."
"China has never been tolerant of dissent or its own minorities, but I do share its concern about the threat of Uighur Islamist terrorism."
"I actually helped convince the Council to ban the Uighur East Turkestan Liberation Front three years ago."
"China's authoritarianism and Han dominance must not be used as an excuse by Uighur terrorists, some of whom are found as far afield as Guantánamo Bay, to spread fear and violence, as most victims of the recent violence were in fact Han Chinese."
"Many of us are naturally concerned about human rights in China and I am also committed as a friend of Taiwan."
"However, the EU remains wedded to a one-China policy and, given that the EU officially considers Taiwan and Tibet part of the People's Republic of China, we should certainly not support in any way the secession of Xinjiang province."
"One interesting aspect of this issue is whether this controversy will cause China's Muslim partners in Africa like Sudan to reassess their links to the country."
"Finally, I note that Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan has labelled this violence as a genocide: a bit rich coming from him when his own country fails to recognise the Armenian genocide."
"His efforts to appeal to pan-Turkic nationalism are also hypocritical, given Turkey's treatment of its own minorities and in particular the Kurds in eastern Turkey."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) The call to jihad has already gone out both inside and outside Xinjiang, and now the bloody clashes between Han Chinese and Uighurs on Chinese territory threaten to escalate dramatically, both in China and beyond."
"The local Christian community is straining absolutely every sinew against the dangerous religious dimension of the ethnic divisions in Xinjiang."
"The community prays specifically for peace, stability and justice for all the citizens of Xinjiang."
"Irrationally enough, the Chinese Government does not take hold of this helping hand, but strikes it down repressively."
"This can be seen from a blatant campaign by government agencies against peaceful protestant house churches of late."
"Thus, on 3 July, eight Christians were arrested in Xinjiang during a service."
"Four of them are still being held in a secret location, while two Chinese-American missionaries have simply gone missing."
"I ask the Council and the Commission to intervene with the Chinese authorities as a matter of urgency in order to ensure freedom of religious practice for all in this critical situation in Xinjiang."
"This would be the only effective antidote to the call to jihad and would also provide proof to Chinese house churches that they are part of Beijing's plans to create a harmonious society."
"Mr President, 'violence', 'a high number of casualties', 'hundreds dead and wounded in China in the uprising in Xinjiang province': those were the alarming reports we received 10 days ago."
"In Xinjiang, the internet was blocked completely, limiting communications into and out of the desert region."
"Taking into account what happened in Tibet last year, recent developments in Eastern Turkestan, also known as Xinjiang, should be a wake-up call to the Chinese Government on its overall policies towards ethnic minorities in China."
"The message sent by the Uighur people is that those policies have failed and that the Chinese Government has to understand this and look for the solution."
"The eight-million-strong Uighur population in the region has long complained about the treatment they receive from the Chinese Central Government and recently during the racist mob attacks the Chinese Government failed to protect the Uighurs from perpetrators of violence."
"It has nothing to do with the war on terror, the controversial concept used by the Chinese Government as a justification for their repressive treatment of the Uighurs in East Turkestan."
"The fact that President Hu Jintao had to shorten his participation in the G8 Summit in Italy to return to China indicates that the Chinese Government realises that events in the province are not just an isolated incident."
"Rather than seeking solutions through repression and crackdown, the Chinese leadership needs positive action addressing the basic grievances of the Uighur people, especially if China wants to show maturity and create a sincerely harmonious society."
"I fully support the EU position expressed by the President-in-Office to urge restraint on all sides and call on the Government of China to respect freedom of speech and information, as well as the right to peaceful protest."
"(FR) Mr President, the outbreak of violence in the autonomous region of Xinjiang is being severely repressed by the Chinese Government."
"The clashes between Uighurs and Hans have taken the official death toll to 186, but the bloodshed continues."
"This violence is being presented by China as a mere interethnic conflict between Hans and Uighurs, when it is in fact the almost inevitable result of its repressive policy in the Xinjiang region."
"The region is strategic but difficult to control."
"As a key transit route and with its wealth of natural resources - gold, oil and gas - it is crucial to the future of China's energy supply."
"However, its population includes many non-Chinese ethnic groups, the largest of which is the Uighurs."
"The latter, which make up almost half of the population, are for the most part Sunni Muslims of Turkish-speaking origin."
"For a decade, they have been systematically discriminated against and threatened with assimilation and death, and their identity is in danger."
"In fact, China's policy towards these ethnic minorities was liberal in the 1980s but it has gradually become tougher, and the Chinese authorities seized upon 11 September 2001 in order to publicise their fight against - and note how they are all merged - terrorism, separatism and religious extremism."
"In April 2009 Amnesty International issued a stark warning: after Tibet, there will be Xinjiang."
"The policy of non-violence having failed, the Uighur separatists would seek other ways of having their demands for recognition of their identity met, and this has indeed happened."
"However, China cannot continue to maintain its cohesion through repeated acts of bloodshed."
"As a signatory to international agreements, it is bound to protect its ethnic minorities."
"Moreover, its constitution, together with its 1984 law on regional autonomy, also oblige it to protect these minorities."
"Is Europe going to continue to shut its eyes and merely condemn the repression and unsuccessfully beg for the release of the political prisoners?"
"No."
"Human rights in China are a political problem, and we must dare to remind that country of its commitments to its people and of the risk that it would run with regard to the international community should it fail to fulfil them."
"We shall expect strong action from the Swedish Presidency in this regard."
"(PL) Mr President, the way in which protests have been dealt with in Xinjiang province has provided further confirmation of the authoritarian nature of the Communist authorities in Beijing."
"At least 180 people are now dead and 1600 injured as a result of the most significant ethnic conflict to take place in China in recent decades."
"The European Parliament is duty bound to condemn violence arising from discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds."
"Such should also be our response in this case, when the might of an authoritarian state has been unleashed against the Uighur minority."
"The latter is not the only victim of totalitarian governments, however."
"The citizens of a Europe based on Christian values have a special duty towards Christian minorities that are persecuted in other parts of the world."
"Unofficial sources indicate that where China is concerned, this minority consists of over 30 million people."
"This means that the representatives of a population the same size as that of a large European country are being harassed, persecuted, prevented from seeking employment, tortured and murdered by the Chinese Communist authorities."
"The Chinese regime is aware that a longing for freedom and the rule of law are concomitant with Christianity, and that is why it is trying to halt the spread of that religion."
"Its attempts to overcome the Church are proving unsuccessful, however, as the number of believers is steadily increasing year on year."
"The Chinese authorities have to understand that the so-called Central State cannot become a truly modern state unless and until it begins to respect the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom of religion."
"(DE) Mr President, today's debate proves once again that the Council is the weak point of the EU."
"This House has adopted a very clear position on human rights and Lady Ashton has given an impressively clear speech on behalf of the Commission."
"However, from the Council I have heard only that they condemn both sides for the violence."
"Of course violence by the Uighurs should be condemned too."
"But can we really compare it to what a communist dictatorship that has learnt nothing from the massacre in Tiananmen Square is doing in suppressing an entire people in a brutal and bloody fashion and threatening this people with ethnocide by means of a targeted settlement policy?"
"Can we compare this to incidents which are quite simply an expression of Chinese propaganda and which are not being investigated by anyone at an international level?"
"I do not think so."
"The Uighurs are currently being accused of separatism."
"However, is it separatism if a house is on fire and I try to escape from this house?"
"Is it separatism if I am wrongfully imprisoned and I try to escape?"
"That is not separatism, that is an expression of the will to live."
"If the Uighurs in China were given space to live in their homeland in freedom and with dignity and independence there would be no more separatism."
"That is the only way to prevent separatism."
"The Uighurs are not a minority, they are a people just like the Swedes, who happen to be smaller in number than the Han Chinese."
"However, is a people in the wrong simply because it is smaller in number?"
"Do we have to bow to a power simply because it is larger?"
"I do not think so."
"We, as the European Union, therefore have an important obligation."
"I represent Munich, and the headquarters of the World Uighur Congress is in Munich."
"Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe were also previously based in Munich."
"We are still proud to have been the voice of freedom at that time."
"I am sure that one day we will be just as proud to have been the centre for the free Uighurs and I hope that one day all Uighurs will enjoy this freedom."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one thing needs to be stated very clearly: there is a unified system in China and we do not want to allow this system to break up."
"We respect the Chinese system."
"However, that does not mean ..."
"(Interruption by Mr Posselt)"
"We respect China's unified system."
"However, that does not mean that the diversity of peoples in China must not also be respected."
"That is what we Social Democrats are calling for."
"We want citizens' rights, human rights and people's freedom to be respected in China."
"We want freedom of expression to be respected."
"We want journalists to be able to move around freely so that the situation as it really is can indeed be reported."
"That is what we want and there is one thing that we would say very clearly to our colleagues in China: what for us is a basic principle we would also expect to be a basic principle for you in China, namely that human rights are universal."
"What the politicians always say to us - let us first solve the social problems and then we can talk about human rights - is the wrong way to go about things."
"It must be the other way round."
"Human rights come first and then social rights, which are quite simply part and parcel of human rights and cannot be separated from them."
"I was therefore very disappointed by what you said, Mr Bildt."
"You seemed to be saying: let us work together on an economic level, that is our main concern and all of the other things are of no particular interest to us."
"That is not the approach that we need."
"We need to take the approach presented to us by the European Commission, namely to say that we first want a common basis for our work on which we can then build our cooperation, because we do want cooperation, that much is clear, but not on any basis, only on a correct basis that respects human dignity."
"Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Bildt on a very balanced speech just now."
"I believe in the borders of the nation state as recognised by the United Nations and so oppose separatist-related violence everywhere in the world, be it in Kashmir, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, where I was born, Northern Ireland, where I got bombed, Spain or even in China."
"I regret that in China, a country very important for the EU, some 1 680 people have been injured and 184 killed."
"The problem started in a toy factory in Guangdong and spread."
"Among those killed in the riots in Urumqi were 137 Han Chinese and 46 Uighur Chinese."
"This is deplorable."
"We must condemn it."
"If these acts were encouraged and perpetrated by outside forces, particularly separatist fundamentalist forces, then they should be indicted in the International Criminal Court."
"If they were home-grown, then it is a matter for the police in China and we must support them."
"We live in a small world."
"We must live together."
"The EU is a clear example of this."
"Supporting separatism anywhere in the world is against the spirit of the EU."
"We cannot work to unite Europe at home and encourage the break-up of China abroad."
"That is the road to chaos and conflict."
"(HU) The question is where do we stand on this issue?"
"Are we on the side of China or Tiananmen Square?"
"Are we on the side of China or Tibet?"
"Are we on the side of China or the Uighur region?"
"Are we on the side of 1.2 billion Chinese or 8 million Uighurs?"
"Are we on the side of repression, the introduction of an alien way of life, a comfortable life, good health and money, or of a peasant, nomad past, which admittedly entails poverty and widespread disease, but preserves one's own culture, and of freedom?"
"The speeches made by one or two of my fellow Members echo the language of the dictatorship of the former Eastern European regimes."
"Can a mother of 11 really be a terrorist?"
"A woman who served time in prison, and two of whose children are still in prison?"
"Where do we stand then?"
"That is the question."
"Are we on the side of token autonomy or real autonomy?"
"Are we on the side of repression, an alien way of life, the exploitation of the Uighur region's natural assets, or of the preservation of cultures, freedom and peoples' right of self-determination?"
"It is obvious to me whose side I am on."
"I hope that it is clear to my fellow Members too."
"We must make friends with China so that it can learn from us."
"However, we must do this by showing an example in the areas of human rights, freedoms, self-determination and autonomy."
"We still have a huge amount of work to do."
"On this point, I am thinking about the countries which have recently joined."
"(NL) I have listened to the introductions from both the Council and the Commission and maybe it is to do with the interpreting, but I have not heard the word Uighurs once, and it is, of course, the Uighurs that we are discussing today."
"There are hundreds of dead whose passing we regret, and many more wounded besides."
"The European Union stands firmly for fundamental rights, human rights, civil rights and peaceful demonstration."
"We are seeing all of these seriously repressed."
"Needless to say, I heard in the introductions about the need for dialogue."
"That need is something that I, too, very much want to stress."
"That dialogue is tremendously important."
"I would really like to find out from the Council and the Commission, however, what tangible measures they are going to put in place in the short term."
"(DE) Mr President, we are having this debate on the basis of the universal nature of human rights, but also on the basis of the need for a global partnership."
"A harmonious society has been mentioned."
"That is one of the slogans of the Communist Party of China, but it is also something more: it reflects a deep hope of the Chinese people."
"A harmonious society is not simply the same as masking authoritarian relations."
"I believe it could be our job to support the Chinese people in their realisation of a harmonious society."
"A partnership involves speaking out clearly."
"When we talk about Xinjiang the word 'Uighurs' should also be mentioned."
"However, clear speaking is not the same as being confrontational - we should avoid that."
"I would like to say one last thing to Mr Posselt."
"He spoke of separatism."
"Now, I know Mr Posselt that your Bavarian party knows something about this, but I think that we should instead follow Mr Brok and talk about continuing with the One China policy."
"Mr President, it would be a great mistake to place China in the same category in this debate today as we discussed Iran."
"The EU enjoys a very good relationship with China and I think we have to take care that our discussions on the recent events in Urumqi are accurate and based on fact."
"The incident that took place on 5 July involved a premeditated attack on the Han Chinese population of that city by the Uighurs."
"As we know, certain militants among the Uighur population of Xinjiang are Islamic fundamentalists who demand a separate state."
"They mounted a violent attack that led to the deaths of 137 Han Chinese."
"So the vast majority of those killed were Han Chinese."
"The Chinese Government quite properly deployed police and military personnel to quell the violence and stop the retaliatory attacks by the Han population on the Uighurs."
"What else would anyone expect them to do?"
"So let us base our criticism on facts and not take unfair records against the Chinese."
"(DE) Mr President, I think that this conflict is very often presented in a very one-sided manner."
"I agree with the previous speaker that in the present case it is frequently a matter of attacks on Han Chinese by Uighurs and indeed that some of these attacks are racially motivated."
"(Heckling)"
"I read an interview with a Uighur woman, for example, who said: Would you like to be governed by yellow communists?"
"The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region, for example they are allowed to have more children, they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples."
"Many of the local Han Chinese are also envious of them."
"We ought therefore to be very discriminating in our observation of this situation and investigate the causes and effects."
"Sometimes problems do not lie where they seem to at first glance."
"We should be careful not to take a one-sided position."
"We ought to support the Chinese in solving their problems."
"The one-sided view that is so often presented in this House is, in my opinion, dangerous."
"The Chinese Government certainly has shortcomings in its policy towards minority groups and it has its failures too."
"However, it is also showing the will to improve in many areas."
"We should therefore help it in this regard through cooperation - and indeed also critical cooperation - based on trust."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I think this debate has really reflected the complexities of the issues that we face."
"What has been addressed here are issues ranging from the different system that China has and the evolution of that particular system, the importance that we attach to human rights and the need to help China develop in the direction of a more open society, better respecting those human rights, as well as the problems attached to minority rights, problems that are there in China."
"But China is unfortunately not unique in the world in facing these issues and the violence, the ethnic violence, that has been seen in the last few days on the streets of Urumqi."
"Ethnic violence is always evil."
"It should be condemned and we can only support those who try to bring reconciliation in this particular situation based on respect for human rights, knowing from our own history the complexity of those issues."
"Mr Bütikofer referred to the concept of a harmonious society."
"We all want to develop and live in harmonious societies and clearly we need to see what we can do in order to help China develop in the direction of a society that is seen as harmonious by each and every one of the citizens of China."
"They are not there yet."
"Few societies as a matter of fact are, but it has been fairly obvious."
"Otherwise let me note that in the initial statements from Mr Brok, Mr Severin and Mr Watson, I found lots of wisdom that could guide our further deliberations as we move on with the important relationship that we seek with China, understanding the complexity of that relationship in all its dimensions."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (DE) Conflict resolution for millions of Uighurs in China - dialogue not condemnation."
"We lament the bloody clashes, the dead and wounded in Xinjiang-Uighur."
"The actions of the police and security forces were excessive and harm the Chinese Government's goals of growth and stability."
"At the same time it is wrong to accuse China of cultural genocide."
"The Government is striving to obtain a balance between the autonomy of minority groups and modernisation in a multi-ethnic state."
"It is also up to us as a partner to support China's development in terms of democracy and the rule of law, without neglecting the special historical, geographic and cultural aspects of this state."
"Biased information will prevent dialogue, and it will not compensate for a policy with an inadequate guarantee of human rights."
"China is an important partner for Europe, alongside the US and Russia."
"Combating the financial crisis, fighting poverty, stopping climate change, providing energy security and guaranteeing the water supply - none of these things can be achieved without the efforts of the People's Republic of China."
"The majority of Uighurs are dismayed over the events of the past week and above all want to live in peace once again."
"The Chinese Government knows that this conflict cannot be solved with violence."
"We can support the dialogue between the Han Chinese and the Uighurs and other minority groups instead of continuing our decade-long interference from the outside with our inapt methods."
"Establishing a structured dialogue aimed at developing the rule of law in China is a more important task for the European Parliament."
"Honduras (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Honduras."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, the world is a big place."
"I am grateful for this opportunity to focus somewhat on the situation in Honduras and the seriousness of the developments that we see there, not only for Honduras but for the entire region."
"I will try to be reasonably brief."
"Since the beginning of this particular crisis last month, the Presidency has condemned the military action that was directed against President Zelaya, who was democratically elected, in spite of everything else that can be said."
"That action was in violation of the constitutional order of Honduras."
"We have called for the restoration of this constitutional order, in full, and urged all parties and institutions to refrain from violence or talks about violence and to strive to find a swift and peaceful solution."
"I think in much the same way as we expect, when we have problems in different parts of Europe, that it is the European Union that should take the lead and we would hope that the rest of the world would support our efforts, our policy has now been guided by giving support to the Organisation of American States in their efforts to find a solution through dialogue and compromise to the problems that they are facing."
"We have a situation where none of our ambassadors at the moment are present in Honduras."
"We do not have any diplomatic contacts at the moment either."
"We very much welcome the recent effort by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, to try to reconcile the differences that exist."
"So far that has proved to be - hardly surprising, one might say - a somewhat difficult enterprise."
"But I am encouraged by the news that there will be new meetings under the chairmanship of President Arias this Saturday."
"We can only encourage him to move forward with those efforts and we can only continue to urge both sides to be ready to compromise, fully respecting every part of the constitution of Honduras."
"Let me conclude by underlining the importance that we attach, beyond the immediate crisis, to the holding of fair, timely and transparent presidential elections in Honduras later this year."
"The rule of law and respect for human rights must remain the cornerstone of democratic government throughout the world; Central America, Latin America, all of America are certainly not excluded."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, again I am pleased to contribute briefly to this debate on behalf of my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, as we look at the political crisis in Honduras."
"After many years, Latin America is again experiencing an institutional rupture."
"The crisis in Honduras shows us how fragile is the rule of law and the institutional framework for the resolution of conflicts in some Latin American countries and, indeed, how these countries can plunge into crisis, especially now that they are going through a period of strong political polarisation."
"The Commission reacted promptly."
"We expressed our deep concern about the events in Honduras and we stressed the great importance we attach to the respect for the rule of law, democracy and democratically elected institutions."
"We have urged all parties involved to resolve their differences peacefully in full respect of the country's legal framework and to promptly engage in a dialogue in the interests of peace and stability in the country."
"We deplored the violent confrontations, even more so as they have resulted in the loss of human lives, and we called upon all parties involved to show the utmost moderation and restraint."
"The Commission declared it would be ready to support all initiatives aimed at a peaceful solution of the crisis and at restoring the constitutional order."
"As the Presidency has said, we supported the initiative by the Organisation of American States and its Secretary-General, Mr Insulza, which unfortunately did not bear fruit."
"We strongly welcomed the mediation efforts of the Costa Rican President and trust that they will result in a peaceful settlement of the crisis."
"Following the events in Honduras and after consulting the Central American governments and EU Member States, it was decided to postpone the next round of negotiations with a view to an association agreement with Central America, negotiations that were due between 6 and 10 July in Brussels."
"But we trust that these negotiations can resume as soon as possible."
"Again, as the Presidency has said, in response to the gravity of the situation the local ambassador of the EU Presidency has been recalled for consultations and all other EU ambassadors have also left the country."
"In close cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States, we continue to explore the ways in which we can best contribute to the solution of this crisis."
"For the time being, suspending our cooperation has not been decided, but disbursement of our financial commitments related to budgetary support has been put on hold."
"We are very much aware that the events in Honduras could create a dangerous precedent, a step back in terms of democracy, and could destabilise the region."
"Therefore, we continue to follow the situation closely and we support all efforts to find a peaceful solution."
"We will continue to keep Parliament informed about any further development."
"Mr President, the fact that an elected President has been removed from his home manu militari, put on a plane and dropped in a foreign country is something that should, from a democratic point of view, be categorically and unreservedly condemned."
"Mr President, on this basis I have to say that the observation made by a number of esteemed analysts, such as Mario Vargas Llosa, is in any case highly significant: the most conspicuous defenders of the deposed President Zelaya - who, by the way, has won support from all the various political parties, including his own, and the Supreme Court of Justice against the National Congress of the Republic - have in fact been representatives of regimes characterised by a systematic violation of human rights and by a progressive decline in individual freedoms, as this Parliament recognised in the last report on the human rights situation in the world."
"We now have to find a way out of this situation."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has said so: the European Union must facilitate a return to democratic normality by supporting the efforts of a man who has been working to stabilise the situation in the region, namely the President of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias."
"Secondly, with regard to the upcoming presidential elections, the European Union needs to make all its election observation experience available to Honduras and should prepare to send an EU election observation mission."
"Lastly, President-in-Office of the Council, it is important that the European Union acts consistently, without double standards."
"It is unacceptable that, on the one hand, the European Union facilitates and intensifies its political dialogue with the only undemocratic country in the region and, on the other hand, makes the citizens of one of the poorest countries in Latin America pay for their leaders' mistakes, to which Mr Zelaya is not exactly oblivious."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I also believe that the European Union needs to be actively present in the region, as Mr Bildt has said."
"That active presence is currently manifesting itself in the negotiations over the association agreement, which are about to come to a head."
"Mr President, we cannot make the innocent suffer for the guilty and, therefore, I believe we need to reconsider a swift return to the negotiating table once the conflict is resolved."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (ES) Mr President, we join in the international community's unanimous condemnation, not only because of the seriousness of the situation itself and of the breakdown in constitutional order - as the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner have highlighted - but also on account of the extremely serious precedent this sets in a region which, with a great deal of work and effort, has managed to restore democracy throughout the continent, with rare exceptions."
"Therefore, we cannot accept this situation."
"The European Union and the Member States have done the right thing in recalling their ambassadors, cancelling all forms of cooperation and suspending negotiations with the region."
"I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission that we must now support a negotiated settlement led by the Social Democrat President of Costa Rica, Óscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and not provoke any repressive or insurrectional violence."
"This is not the time to analyse the real or presumed mistakes that might have been made by President Zelaya, who has six months left in office; for that is not the matter at hand."
"This is a time to analyse the very serious breakdown in constitutional order in Honduras brought on by the armed forces (with the support of Congress and the judiciary, certainly, but in an entirely illegitimate and illegal manner)."
"There will be time enough to consider his future, but today we must demand President Zelaya's restoration without the slightest hesitation; he is the country's constitutional President until January 2010."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) (Speaks briefly in Basque.)"
"Mr President, I am speaking in Basque, a minority language which is not yet official in this House: Basque."
"I hope that it will be so in the future, as other languages are, and that we will, therefore, be able to speak in my mother tongue and in the language of the Basque Country."
"That said, I agree, and my group agrees, with the need for an outright rejection of the coup - for we should call it by its real name - that has taken place in Honduras."
"Some may consider it a mistake to have tried to consult the will of the people, perhaps above all else; but we are not here to analyse that."
"I also agree that both the Commission and the Council have to work to facilitate the restoration of the constitutional and institutional order that has been overturned and to ensure the return of the Honduran President, who was legitimately elected by all the people."
"I, too, am concerned about the attacks endured by some members of the government, even in official diplomatic missions in Honduras, which, as we have heard, have been recalled."
"Naturally, as the representative of the Commission has done, my group also supports all the action that the Organization of American States has taken to address and resolve this conflict."
"My group believes that we in Europe need to help to strengthen democracy in Honduras, to ensure fundamental rights are developed and, therefore, to ensure that political dialogue is the only tool used to bring us closer to a solution to the problem we are now experiencing."
"It goes without saying that we also support all the work being done by the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Óscar Arias, and accordingly we also hope that, once the aforementioned measures are in place, elections can be held in November 2009 with full transparency and with total respect for the democratic system and for human rights."
"I hope, too, that the current situation will also allow us to continue the negotiations in order to conclude the association agreement with the European Union."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to use this opportunity to strongly condemn and to express our dismay at the recent events in Honduras."
"I have been following the situation in the country and the region in the last few years in my role as Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America; it is particularly significant for me and of the utmost importance that we are discussing this matter on the first day of political debate in this House."
"That fact shows that this is a fundamental issue: the event has the sad and regrettable honour of being considered the first coup d'état in a Central American country in the 21st century, and that is something we should not forget."
"Therefore, I not only strongly condemn the coup d'état against President Zelaya, but I also urge the European Union not to recognise the coup leader, Roberto Micheletti."
"Furthermore, I believe it is vital that the European Union insists, as it is in fact already doing, that constitutional order be restored."
"It is crucial that the November 2009 elections should be prepared in a serious, responsible and credible manner and, with that in mind, I am also pleased that talks aimed at forming an association agreement with the region have been suspended, at least for the time being."
"I also ask that we suspend aid in the form of trade support, as others such as the World Bank or the United States have done, with the exception of humanitarian aid."
"Beyond these measures, I think it is important to remember the need to carry out a clear and concise investigation into who should be held accountable in this coup d'état."
"It is clear that many people are responsible, that there are many other interests behind this coup and, in some cases, we do not even know their names."
"I believe the European Union should press for such an investigation and, for that to happen, we need to send permanent, on-site international delegations who can support the movements that are emerging in the country, in order to demand, reclaim and call for the democracy that has been taken from them."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, four days after the coup, my parliamentary group decided to send me to Tegucigalpa to observe in situ the consequences of this military coup, this coup d'état."
"In Tegucigalpa, I was able to witness the consequences of any military coup, namely: repression; a lack of freedom; arrest warrants issued against members of parliament who did not support the coup; leaders of social groups imprisoned; and hospitals, with many injured people, taking advantage of the curfew."
"That was the detailed picture I gained there."
"I welcome the response issued by the Council and the European Commission, for that is the only possible response."
"Firstly, all the requirements issued by the Organization of American States must be met."
"May I state here that, in the meeting I had with the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, I found that they are very clear on this matter: any action carried out by the illegitimate government of the coup leader, Roberto Micheletti, will be declared null and void and, therefore, the Organization of American States has already decided that it is not going to observe any kind of election held by that government."
"I hope that the European Union will also follow the same code of conduct - the same road map - so that any action carried out by that government will not be considered legitimate."
"As a result, under those circumstances we would not be able to observe elections rigged by a government that had seized power in a coup."
"It seems to me that this is going to be a decisive week."
"President Zelaya, the only President of Honduras, has made things very clear: he has made it very clear that he is giving the situation one more week and, if it is not decided within a week at the Costa Rica talks that he should return, he will return anyway."
"Therefore, given the decision made by the only legitimate President, I hope that Parliament, the Institutions, the Council and the Commission will support his decision as the Organization of American States is doing, as the United Nations is doing and, by the way, as the United States is doing."
"Consequently, I believe that it is very important that such a tone, a tone demanding the restoration of constitutional power and the restoration of President Zelaya, serves as Parliament's identifying feature."
"My fellow Members, I hope we come to the firm decision that this House condemns the coup d'état unreservedly and supports the restoration of President Zelaya."
"I also hope that we will, therefore, endorse all of the international organisations' initiatives."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by joining with the previous speakers in condemning in the harshest possible terms the coup d'état staged against the government of President Zelaya in Honduras."
"His arbitrary detention and his expulsion from the country are in breach of the constitutional order, which must be restored as quickly as possible."
"The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known, and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view."
"I therefore welcome the Organization of American States' decision to suspend Honduras' involvement in the organisation, and the acceptance of President Oscar Arias as a mediator helping to find a solution."
"However, I am also very concerned, Commissioner, about the commercial relations that the European Union maintains with this country."
"For several months negotiations have been taking place between the European Commission and Central America on a new-generation association agreement."
"Following the coup d'état, meetings planned last week have been cancelled."
"We should be glad about that."
"I thought I understood you, but I should like to have more details."
"Is the Commission determined to suspend the negotiations until the institutional political situation in Honduras has returned to normal?"
"That is what I and my political group are asking, but I should like to have more details concerning the Commission's position on this point."
"Another issue that I wish to raise, Commissioner, is that of the Generalised System of Preferences Plus, from which Honduras benefits."
"Several organisations from civil society have reported arbitrary decisions and human rights violations since the coup d'état, particularly as regards freedom of movement, association and expression."
"The European Commission has to be very firm on this issue."
"The GSP+ is an incentive, the benefits of which are dependent on clear commitments."
"The testimonies are more than enough to cast doubt on whether the State of Honduras is fulfilling its commitments under its self-proclaimed president."
"I therefore call on the Commission to launch an investigation into the possibility of temporarily withholding the preferences granted to Honduras under the GSP+."
"(FR) Mr President, our peace-loving principles must not lead us to give the impression that, by appealing to both parties of the current conflict to show restraint, we believe that the perpetrators of the coup d'état in Honduras and the constitutional government are as guilty as each other."
"In a case such as this, the violence of the insurgents who are fighting for the return of President Zelaya is legitimate and that of the putschists is criminal."
"The personal involvement of the Heads of State or Government of Central and South America to secure the unconditional return to power of the Constitutional President, Manuel Zelaya, shows that the entire continent wants an end once and for all to the period of coups d'états and dictatorships."
"Following the unanimous decisions of the UN and of all the regional cooperation organisations, Europe must play its part in this fight, since it is a fight, not an arrangement."
"It is a historic fight."
"Europe must break off all relations of all kinds - political, commercial - and all negotiations with the factious regime until the time of President Zelaya's unconditional and non-negotiable return to power, since there is nothing to negotiate where democracy is concerned."
"Europe must call on the Obama Administration and on the United States to break off their commercial and military relations with the factious regime, too."
"This is the price at which we will prove equal to the principles that we so often claim to observe in order to criticise those of others."
"(PL) Mr President, the situation in Honduras requires that the European Union continue specific and resolute action which will lead to stabilisation, restore constitutional order and prevent a growth in the conflict between supporters and opponents of ousted President Zelaya."
"Therefore I support the initiative proposed by Mr Salafranca to say as soon as possible that a mission endorsed by the European Parliament can be sent to Honduras."
"The disputing parties should be led as soon as possible to begin talks, which will enable an agreement to be made allowing President Zelaya to return to his position and serve to the end of the current term of office, but without the possibility of altering the constitution to make possible his re-election."
"A solution like this would provide hope for stabilisation of the situation, although it may not be acceptable to both..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, I believe that, as the European Parliament and as the European Union, we must make the necessary changes so that the coup in Honduras is as short as possible, President Zelaya returns to his country and the circle of military coups in Latin and Central America is finally closed."
"We must consider the enormous progress and democratic changes made over recent years in a series of countries, changes which strengthen constitutional and democratic freedoms, which defend the concept and essence of policy against the uncontrolled position of the market trying to oust it and which break the long-standing bonds of neo-colonialism."
"That is why I believe that we should consider the huge responsibility of Europe for peaceful action at international level and restore democratic ties and ties of solidarity with the peoples and countries on the other side of the Atlantic."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I think all of those who have spoken have spoken very much in strong terms in favour of the defence of democracy and constitutional order throughout Latin America."
"In that, of course, there is a condemnation of what happened."
"Whatever the background, we do not send in the military to arrest the elected president of a country and send him abroad."
"Irrespective of the background, we must be very clear on this; we are very clear on this."
"But then, in order to resolve the situation, there must be some sort of accommodation, some sort of compromise."
"Judging from what I have heard from Mr Salafranca and others, everyone agrees that President Arias is probably the man best suited to achieve that particular compromise."
"He will probably have to spend quite some time in negotiating with representatives of both the parties but I think it is important that he has our support as well as the support of the other American states for these particular efforts."
"As to the nature of the particular solution, that is for him to judge and for them to agree."
"But clearly, on the basis of what I said initially, the restoration of constitutional order is what we seek."
"The return of President Zelaya is a necessity when it comes to the restoration of constitutional order."
"It is probably not sufficient and in all probability there are going to be other elements in bringing about a full restoration of constitutional order."
"So what we are calling for in the form of the restoration and return of President Zelaya is a necessary but in all probability not sufficient part of the restoration of constitutional order, which is of key importance for our relationship with Honduras, for the development of Honduras and for the credibility of constitutional order and democracy in that part of the world."

"(DE) Mr President, yesterday we received very sad news from Grozny in Chechnya."
"The journalist Natalia Estemirova, who was well known to everyone in our group, was murdered there."
"She was found dead just beyond the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia after being kidnapped in Grozny."
"Natalia Estemirova was extremely committed to her work for Memorial in Chechnya."
"We would ask you to agree to our request to remember this very committed journalist and pioneering fighter for freedom and human rights in Chechnya by observing a minute's silence."
"(Applause)"

"Announcement by the President"
"(After the speech by Mrs Harms, see item 4.1)."
"Yes, Mrs Harms."
"Regarding the matter that you have just mentioned, I must inform the House that President Buzek has made a public statement, which I will read to you."
"It is with great sadness that I have learned of the tragic death of Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted earlier today in Grozny."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of the deceased."
"Natalia Estemirova was a human rights activist and a leading researcher, with Memorial, on Chechnya."
"In 2005 she was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal by the EPP Group in the European Parliament."
"We in the European Parliament have appreciated her work in the fields of human rights, promoting democratic accountability and the implementation of the rule of law."
"We strongly call on the authorities of the Russian Federation to start a fully fledged inquiry into her death and to do their utmost to bring those responsible for this tragic death to justice."
"The European Parliament is at the forefront of promoting democracy, implementing the rule of law and defending human rights."
"It is, therefore, our obligation to support and show our solidarity with all those who struggle everywhere in the world for the same values, as was the case with Natalia Estemirova."
"(Applause)"

"Statements by the President"
"Just over a fortnight ago, I took part in the ceremonies at Westerplatte to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the outbreak of the Second World War."
"That war plunged Europe into terror, claimed millions of victims and divided our continent for nearly half a century."
"We should never forget that war and violence could once again return to this Europe of ours."
"I must refer to another act of violence that took place this summer."
"Two officers of the Spanish Civil Guard were killed by ETA whilst performing their duties."
"I am sorry to have to inform Parliament of the death of Mr Ernest Gline, a former Belgian Member of this House, who passed away on 10 August at the age of 78."
"Mr Gline was a Member of the European Parliament between 1968 and 1994."
"He also served as Chairman of the Socialist Group between 1979 and 1984."
"I regret to have to inform you also of the death of Sir Christopher Prout, a former British Member of this House, who passed away on 12 July at the age of 67."
"Sir Christopher Prout, who subsequently became Lord Kingsland, was a Member of the European Parliament between 1979 and 1994. He also served as Chairman of the Group of European Democrats between 1987 and 1994."
"Before we move on to our discussions, I invite you to join with me in honouring the memory of those who laid down their lives in the defence of Europe, and of those others who devoted their lives to its service, working to transform it into what it now is."

"Monday and Tuesday"
"No changes."
"(FR) Mr President, I shall be extremely brief."
"I should like in fact to invoke the Rules of Procedure relating to the Conference of Presidents which, as you pointed out, Mr President, sets the agenda."
"Our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Conference of Presidents shall consist of yourself, obviously, of the group chairmen, and also of a representative of the non-attached Members."
"To date, the representative of the non-attached Members has still not been appointed."
"A number of non-attached Members have written to you on this issue and are more than willing to meet with you."
"It would be good, Mr President, if you could convene a meeting of all the non-attached Members so that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, they can elect their delegate to the Conference of Presidents and the Conference can take its decisions with a full complement of members."
"Thank you for your comment."
"I shall contact you and other Members during this sitting in order to make the necessary arrangements."
"Wednesday"
"I have received a motion by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for Wednesday."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference of Presidents has voted to place the election - the appointment - of the President of the Commission on Wednesday's agenda."
"On Tuesday afternoon we will hold a debate on the President of the Commission's proposals."
"We propose postponing the vote on his appointment, for the simple reason that the referendum in Ireland is due to be held in 22 days' time."
"This referendum is crucial to the acceptance, or rejection, of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"An opinion poll published today tells us that 62% of Irish people are ready to vote in favour."
"I believe that we must respect the people of Ireland's vote, whether we are for or against the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, it seems absurd to us, for the sake of 21 days, to bring forward a vote and appoint a president under the Treaty of Nice, when we - at least, those who are for the Treaty of Lisbon - have the possibility of having a Commission and its President appointed under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In October, we will know what we are bound by."
"The Polish President has solemnly declared that he will sign the Treaty of Lisbon after the Irish referendum."
"The Czech Constitutional Court has solemnly declared that it will speed up decision making on the two complaints against the Treaty of Lisbon since, last time, it was unanimous in saying that the Treaty of Lisbon was constitutional."
"There is therefore no option for the Czech President to say 'No' once the Treaty has been ratified in Poland and Ireland."
"I have nearly finished, but this is very important, Mr President."
"It is Parliament's identity that is at stake on this issue, and if we do not have two minutes to reflect on it then we have not done our job as MEPs."
"That is an important point."
"That is why I am asking you not to vote for or against Mr Barroso, but to vote after the people of Ireland and to postpone the vote today and to vote next month if necessary."
"Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit discussed a motion put forward by my group in the Conference of Presidents last week."
"We put forward the motion in question as we believe that it is not really the issue of the Irish referendum, nor the issue of the Constitutional Court in Prague, but the issue of the lack of cohesion in the opinions of the Council that is responsible for the confusion currently prevalent."
"It is abundantly clear that a community based on law - and the European Union claims to be just that - must act in accordance with applicable law."
"The applicable law is the Treaty of Nice."
"There is therefore no alternative to working with the Treaty of Nice, and that means working with the President of the Commission and all the Commissioners."
"The Council wants to elect the President on the basis of the Treaty of Nice but to then do what Mr Cohn-Bendit referred to, namely to apply the Treaty of Lisbon to Commissioners, which would mean that we would have a President of the Commission elected on a different legal basis than his Commissioners - which, by the way, is something the President of the Commission himself thinks is very regrettable."
"That is why he is going around talking of the Lisbon majority that he needs but will not get."
"That, on its own, shows the confusion that the Council has given rise to, something that is in no way beneficial to the EU or to the President of the Commission himself."
"For this reason, we were of the opinion that the vote should be delayed until the Council has managed to agree what it wants."
"We therefore support this ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"We believe that this postponement is necessary for reasons that differ little from those enunciated by Mr Cohn-Bendit, and for the reasons we have mentioned, we support the motion."
"I should now like a Member to speak against the motion."
"Mr Daul has asked for the floor."
"You have the floor, Mr Daul."
"Mr President, I always keep to my speaking time, as you know."
"Firstly, I do not understand Mr Cohn-Bendit: he should have already asked for the election of the European Parliament to be postponed until such time as we had the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Since, today, we have the Treaty of Nice in the European Parliament, we call for that Treaty to be applied until the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force."
"I would also ask that, until we are able to vote again on Mr Barroso, we abide by the rules to the very end."
"Parliament must be ready to function under the Treaty of Lisbon and, then, we will be able to vote on Mr Barroso and the Treaty of Lisbon, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"Otherwise, we will not be consistent."
"That is what I wished to say to you."
"In order to have a Commission - and I am going to request this tomorrow - I would ask that, after the referendum of 2 October, we put in place a Commission on the basis of the Treaty that exists, that is, Nice."
"We will debate the Treaty of Lisbon when the time comes, when Mr Cohn-Bendit has convinced Mr Klaus to sign - and as he is willing to do so, he will do so very quickly."
"We will place Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon, and then we will elect our President of the Commission under the Treaty of Lisbon, because, if we want to be consistent, we have to be so from start to finish."
"What we need now is a Commission that functions in the recession, a Commission that functions under Copenhagen."
"However, as you know, there is still a long way to go before all of the commissioners and the Commission are up and running."
"That is why I, together with my equally competent group members, ask that we vote on Wednesday for the President of the Commission."

"Explanations of vote"
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Algirdas Šemeta as a member of the European Commission."
"I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision."
"Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner."
"As I see it, the European Parliament does not have any power in this particular case, and its Rules of Procedure, paragraph 2(2) of Annex XVII of which stipulates a vote by secret ballot, are not in line with the Treaty."
"This stipulation of the Rules of Procedure is certainly imperative for the European Parliament, but not for a properly appointed commissioner."
"Article 214(2) of the EC Treaty, curiously mentioned as the legal basis of the resolution, concerns not the nomination of a commissioner in the event of a resignation, but the vote to approve the entire Commission as a college."
"It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner."
"I voted in favour of Mr Šemeta, whom I would like to congratulate on the appointment he has been given, and I wish him every success."
"However, I cannot but express my concern - yet again, because I have also done this in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - about the suggestion made by him that part of the funds required to finance the European economic recovery plan should be obtained through reducing the funds earmarked for direct aid to the agricultural sector."
"I hope that this was just a simple misunderstanding and that such a measure, which would be impossible to accept, will not be implemented."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution approving the nomination of Mr Paweł Samecki as a member of the European Commission."
"I question, however, the legal aspects of this decision."
"Indeed, pursuant to Article 215(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which lays down the rules in the event of a commissioner resigning, it is the Council which, acting by qualified majority, appoints the substitute commissioner."

"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"We shall now proceed to the speeches, which must not last longer than one minute."
"There is a very long list of requests."
"This shows a great desire to participate, which is to the credit of this House."
"However, I will be unable to give the floor to all those who wish to speak, because 100 requests would take an hour and a half, whereas we have only 30 minutes available."
"(GA) Mr President, since this is my first opportunity to speak in Parliament, I would like to begin in my native language."
"As you know, the campaign for the Lisbon referendum is well underway in Ireland at the moment, and we are hopeful that there will be a positive result on 2 October."
"One of the things that is making a big difference this time round is the guarantees the European Union gave to the Irish Government in relation to tax, abortion and defence."
"The new capacity for sports included in the Treaty of Lisbon, something which was not mentioned at all last time round, is also very important."
"As one who has been involved in sport all my life at different levels of playing and administration, I believe that the possibility under Lisbon of the EU taking sports seriously and supporting both indigenous and international sports has struck a chord with the Irish sporting public."
"For that reason, and for the other more obvious reasons such as the health, social and physical benefits of sport, it is imperative that substantial funding is provided post-Lisbon to ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Mr President, I believe that there are certain disparities within Romania's agriculture sector in terms of structural problems, compared with other Member States."
"I must emphasise that the European Union should use the political and economic leverage it has to focus more attention on the management of the funds allocated for agriculture to those Member States who have joined later."
"I wish to express my view that supporting a sustainable agricultural sector with an appropriate budget after 2013 as well would solve this problem, offering farmers medium and long-term prospects, along with sufficient funds so that Romanian agriculture can come into line with European standards and create an opportunity for a united Europe."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, Hungary and the Hungarian minorities are constantly bringing up the issue of national minorities."
"Through recourse to half-truths and sometimes even lies, they try to manipulate European public opinion in their favour."
"What is the truth?"
"Over the past eighty years, national minorities in Hungary have been all but wiped out, while Europe looked on in silence."
"The Slovak minority has also been cut down from 300 000 to 10 000 members."
"The size of the Hungarian minorities in surrounding countries, including Slovakia, has remained constant."
"Over the past two years, six Roma citizens have been murdered in Hungary and dozens have been seriously wounded."
"There are fears of attacks against Jews, while other forms of extremism are on the increase and are spilling across Hungary's borders."
"This aggression is not being handled properly in Hungary and it must be condemned."
"European institutions should take a stronger approach to these manifestations of extremism."
"(PT) The coup that took place in Honduras on 28 June was an outrage against the Honduran people's freedom of political expression and most basic democratic rights."
"Since then, the de facto government has adopted repressive measures against the grassroots movement that has been demonstrating in the streets and has introduced a regime of media blackout, restriction of freedoms, persecution, illegal detentions, disappearances and even murders of members of the organised resistance to the coup."
"We were able to witness all that during the recent visit of a delegation from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left to Honduras and Nicaragua, where we met the legitimate president of the country, Manuel Zelaya."
"The European institutions' reaction to these circumstances is ambiguous to say the least."
"While some are unacceptably silent, others are appealing to both sides to do everything in their power to reach a political solution as swiftly as possible, treating things that are different as if they were the same and ignoring who is to blame, as if there were not a democratically elected president on one side and an illegal government on the other, which detained him and expelled him from the country when it unlawfully seized power."
"The most basic respect for democracy requires the European institutions to issue a firm and forceful condemnation of the coup and to implement measures at an international level to increase pressure on the illegal government in power and isolate it."
"They must also not recognise or support any elections that are held before democratic legality is restored in the country."
"Mr President, as a new Member of this Parliament, I believe that one of the major issues facing farmers in Wales and the rest of the UK is the proposed electronic identification of sheep, which will come into effect on 1 January 2010."
"The fact is that the scanning equipment to be used is not accurate. My understanding is that it is only 79% accurate, which will cause major problems for farmers throughout the UK."
"I urge the Commission to rethink this policy and only bring it in on a voluntary basis."
"My fear is that many farmers will be penalised due to inaccurate equipment and that their single farm payments will be reduced."
"In the worst case scenarios, the reduction could be 100%."
"The concessions that have already been made are helpful but are not enough."
"I find it quite astonishing that the Commission wants to bring in electronic identification (EID) with such huge flaws in the equipment."
"The sensible way forward would be for EID to be introduced only on a voluntary basis from next January."
"I urge Members of this Parliament to support me on this vital issue for the farming industry throughout Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to call on this Parliament to take immediate and effective steps to save the small and family farmers in new Member States, especially eastern and central European Member States, and, in particular, my own country, Hungary."
"What has happened to these farmers?"
"As a result of joining the European Union we had to 'offer', so to speak, 100% of our markets and, in exchange, we received 25% of subsidies."
"This is not just unfair and unjust, but also illegal: this was a clear violation of the Treaty of Rome."
"Now, as these farmers have been trying to compete in these unjust and illegal circumstances, they had to take loans - huge loans - to be competitive."
"Now they have become bankrupt, and they have to sell their lands under circumstances of colonialisation where we have to open our lands for countries that have 10 times more GDP than we do."
"I call for immediate reconsideration of the Copenhagen Agreement."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Mr President, just like other fellow Members, I would have liked to raise a problem from the agricultural sector."
"However, a recent article published in the Wall Street Journal attracted my attention in particular, and this is why I am making it a duty of honour to present this article to Parliament and to put forward the requests made by its authors."
"The title of the article, which I feel is sufficient to be able to understand what it is about, was: 'Mr Barroso, Take Down Small Business Walls'."
"This article is nothing other than an appeal to the future European Commission to focus, at the heart of its actions, on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, which are very vulnerable during a crisis, and not to compromise in any way on implementing the 2008 Small Business Act."
"The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that these measures are implemented properly and efficiently because they are needed by the 20 million plus small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union."
"(BG) Mr President, in early August, an incredible drama unfolded in the Republic of Macedonia which shocked Bulgarian public opinion."
"Spaska Mitrova, a 23-year-old Macedonian citizen and mother of a small child still being breast-fed, was forcibly taken to a police station and then transferred to the infamous Idrizovo prison, while her child was taken away from her."
"The police had to drag her by the hair from the top to the bottom floor of the building because she did not want to be separated from her child."
"She was sentenced to three months' imprisonment because she was unable to provide her ex-husband with a bed in their child's bedroom."
"You can imagine the implications of this."
"Mrs Mitrova was also given Bulgarian citizenship early this year."
"This seems to be the main reason for her inhumane treatment, and hers is not an isolated case."
"About two years ago, I asked the present Macedonian Foreign Minister: 'Why is so much hatred shown towards Macedonians who have taken Bulgarian citizenship?', to which he replied: 'They are vestiges of the past'."
"As the efforts made by the Bulgarian President and Government have not yielded any result, I appeal to Commissioner Olli Rehn to familiarise himself personally with this blatant case of injustice in a country wishing to start accession negotiations."
"(SL) Italy wishes to impose an onshore gas terminal on the border with Slovenia without consultation."
"However, the European Union was founded on mutual trust and good neighbourly relations."
"The supply of environmentally-harmful energy sources requires special conservation of the environment but, in essence, it also requires basic honesty."
"By seeking to conceal from Slovenia the harmful consequences which its actions will have on the cross-border environment, Italy is harming everyone concerned, including itself but, above all, the people who live in the vicinity of the disputed installation."
"The Slovenian public and the Slovenian Government are firmly opposed to this terminal."
"Lying to the cameras may well be Mr Berlusconi's means of political survival in Italy."
"However, such behaviour cannot and should not be tolerated as a deliberate practice within the European Union."
"This is unacceptable."
"This is a flagrant breach of the principles of the European Union and Italy is being manipulative to the detriment of human life and the environment."
"It is using international deception to attempt to build an onshore terminal at Žavlje (Aquilinia) in the Gulf of Trieste, which is already extremely narrow."
"It is degrading the environment, destroying the prospect of communal coexistence on the border and setting a very poor example to future Member States."
"(PT) Mr President, what is happening to the former German footwear factory, Rhode, in Santa Maria da Feira, now called Sociedade Luso-Alemã de Calçado, is very worrying."
"This company once employed some 3 000 workers but, after the problems in Germany, it shed jobs and currently has roughly 1 000 workers."
"The majority of them are women, most of whom have had their hours and wages cut."
"It is now feared that when the elections in Portugal are over, the company may close."
"Unemployment in this municipality is continuing to rise and now affects many thousands of workers, particularly in the footwear and cork processing industries."
"In view of that, we appeal for special emergency intervention measures so as to prevent yet another serious blow to production and jobs in an area that has been so badly blighted by unemployment."
"Mr President, I do not accept the validity of this Parliament or any other EU institution to make laws for the United Kingdom."
"My electors have sent me here to tell you that they do not want GBP 45 million of their money every single day spent in the European Union."
"We want that money spent in the UK on our schools, on our hospitals and our infrastructure, not wasted on corruption with your accounts in auditing for 14 years."
"Simply, I have this message from the people who elected me to the Commission: go back to your bureaucracy and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the corrupt and doomed mess that is the European Union."
"Mr President, this Parliament has united in recent times in the face of a global terrorist threat."
"In my constituency of Northern Ireland, we know the pain of terrorism."
"Yes, we have witnessed a transformation in Northern Ireland in recent years, but there are still those who would seek to cause bloodshed."
"Last week, in the latest of a series of incidents, a 600 lb bomb was planted by dissident republicans and was discovered in South Armagh."
"Had it not been discovered, multiple loss of life would have occurred."
"In Northern Ireland, we have not forgotten the victims of our past and of terrorism and that is why I would ask this Parliament to back the campaign for compensation from Libya."
"Libya supplied weapons to the IRA."
"Those weapons took many lives and left others destroyed."
"For this they must be held accountable."
"(SK) At the start of a new term in office, we should bear in mind our joint responsibility for the peaceful development of the continent of Europe in such a way as to ensure a peaceful and prosperous life for our citizens."
"We must also show our citizens that we are here for them, that we are here to serve them."
"We must constantly bear this in mind, even when there are problems between two members of our family."
"The European way of sorting things out is through proper partnership dialogue aimed at a sensible solution, not through ignoring the other side and presenting issues directly to European institutions such as this one."
"Rational mutual dialogue on a constant basis is also the way to deny sustenance to extremists on both sides of the border and thereby nip in the bud or severely restrict potentially dangerous activities they might undertake in the future."
"(RO) The fight against racism is being waged through strong European policies, but in less than a week, German and British politicians have been engaged in mudslinging at Romanian workers, whether out of ignorance or because they are motivated by winning sympathy and votes from the population."
"Grim statements such as 'Romanians would stick a knife in you as quick as look at you', made during a public meeting in the UK, or comments made by a German politician stating that Romanians do not come to work for 07.00 and they do not know what they have to do, are a major sign of concern."
"We are devising European policies to combat racism."
"This is our common objective."
"However, what do we do when these statements are made by fellow politicians from large European Union Member States?"
"(ES) Mr President, last week, three Basque tuna boats from Bermeo were threatened once again by Somalian pirates."
"We are concerned about the repeated attacks on fishing boats in the area, the fact that the victims feel unsafe and that the Spanish Government is failing to act."
"These attacks could get worse with the arrival of the monsoons, as the fishermen are saying."
"Therefore, before it is too late, I want to say to the House that we urgently need armed military escorts on these boats."
"There are European governments such as France and Italy that have done this, and it has succeeded."
"The Commission should therefore recommend that all Member States take immediate, effective measures such as this."
"We urgently need to extend the protection criteria that have been established for merchant navy routes to fishing areas."
"This House has a problem, which it stated in the Resolution on piracy on 23 October last year."
"Finally, I would like to reiterate our conviction that Europe needs a common foreign and security policy that makes the European institutions more effective and credible in response to this type of crisis."
"(EL) Mr President, the deadly attacks by the German troops which form part of the occupying army in Afghanistan, together with the United States of America, the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ, during the attack in the region of Kunduz on 4 September 2009, turned into a massacre, with victims numbering over 135 civilians dead and dozens injured, including many children, and are war crimes against the Afghan people."
"This attack was not, of course, against the Taliban; it was against 500 civilians."
"The daily bloodbath, the organisation of violent and corrupt elections to put puppets of the Afghan occupation in place and the poverty and misery which are the scourge of the Afghan people reveal that the imperialist attacks by the United States of America, the European Union and ΝΑΤΟ in this occupied country - and in a series of other countries - on the pretext of combating terrorism have disastrous consequences for the people."
"Both the statements made by the new NATO Secretary General, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and those made by European Union foreign ministers have just one objective: to continue the interventions against the people."
"The people in each country and in each Member State of the European Union must demand and insist that the troops leave their countries and return to their own country."
"Mr President, on 2 October, the Irish will have a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Lisbon Treaty is almost identical to the European Constitution, which was rejected outright by the French and the Dutch."
"The Lisbon Treaty has already been rejected by the Irish once, but 'no' is always the wrong answer, as far as the European Union is concerned, when it comes to further political integration."
"And so the Irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the European Union - which is 'yes'."
"The European Union is destroying democracy in its Member States."
"The EU is founded on misrepresentation, deceit and lies."
"The British are denied a referendum by our contemptible government and political class precisely because they know that the result would be a resounding 'no'."
"But whatever the result in Ireland, Britain will one day leave the European Union and restore its national independence."
"I am proud to use my position of office to campaign for Britain's unconditional withdrawal from the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr Batten."
"I gave you an extra 14 seconds even though you said something incorrect, namely that the Treaty of Lisbon is the same thing as the Constitution."
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to talk to you today about a European project, 'Voices of Youth', of which I have the honour of being asked to be a patron."
"The goal of this project, which young people from every Member State participate in, is for them to identify and offer solutions to social problems they face."
"I ask not only you, Mr President, but also the President of the European Commission, to ensure that we pay more attention to the suggestions they make to us."
"It is our responsibility during these difficult times to guarantee Europe and, above all, young European citizens, a clear opportunity."
"My generation has been fortunate enough to be involved in the reconstruction of a united Europe."
"Young people have the right, representing the Europe of today, but particularly the Europe of tomorrow, to turn it into how they imagine it will be."
"Thank you and may God's help be with us."
"Thank you, and thank you also for being concise."
"(HU) The spectre of extreme left-wing and extreme right-wing ideology, reflecting the two dictatorships that dominated Europe in the 20th century, is returning to haunt the European Union in the 21st century."
"We have an EU citizen being banned from travelling to another country."
"This person's freedom of movement is being restricted."
"A state would lock up 15 citizens, accuse them of treason and ban them from leaving the country because they are going to discuss minority-related concerns with like-minded compatriots at the Forum of Hungarian MPs from the Carpathian Basin."
"In the country in question, people are punished for not speaking the official language properly in hospitals, at police stations, in homes for the elderly and maternity units."
"Not even immigrants are treated like this within the European Union, let alone people who have lived on this territory for a thousand years, where a new state has been formed for only 17 years."
"This is why it is important to implement within the European Union a single law for the protection of minorities which is binding on every country."
"Mr President, I wish to inform Parliament that last week, the UK Justice Minister gave Michael Shields, my constituent, a pardon, and he was freed from prison having served four and a half years for a crime he did not commit."
"Michael was given a pardon on the basis of evidence clearly showing that he was morally and technically innocent of the crime."
"He was arrested, charged and convicted of a brutal attack on Martin Georgiev, a Bulgarian waiter, in 2005 in less than eight weeks, despite the lack of forensic evidence, a flawed identification process and a signed confession to the attack by another man, Graham Sankey."
"Today I want to thank Presidents Borrell and Pöttering and Parliament's Committee on Petitions for supporting Michael's campaign for justice."
"But this is not the end of the process, and I ask the President and the Committee on Petitions to continue to support Michael's campaign for justice and to intervene with the Bulgarian authorities immediately to review the dossier of evidence."
"This is vital if we are to give every one of our citizens trust and confidence in judicial and police cooperation in Europe."
"(ET) Banking requires supervision."
"That is the position of the European Council and the European Commission."
"The European Commission consumer protection study published in February revealed several negative trends in banking."
"As an elected representative from Estonia, I would like to present some examples from Estonia concerning two Swedish banks that are operating in Estonia."
"The problem is that these banks treat consumers in Estonia differently from consumers in their home country."
"Both the prices of banking services and interest rates are considerably higher for Estonian consumers."
"Interest rates, for instance, vary from 0.21% in Sweden to 12.2% in Estonia - that is a 600-fold difference."
"Using the financial crisis as a justification for unequal treatment is not in keeping with European Union values."
"And I would like to ask Sweden, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union, what it has to say about this, and how long this situation with their banks will continue in Estonia."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a democratic revolution, I said, and now we face a situation that represents an untenable state of affairs for all those of us who, of our own free will, are not represented in a political group in this Parliament."
"I would like to ask the Bureau to find an amicable solution to the issue of coordinators."
"In this respect, we are discriminated against, as we are not permitted to take part in coordinators' meetings in various committees and be duly active."
"I would be glad to help avoid a situation where proceedings before the European Court of Justice - as previously in the wake of the discrimination case from 2001 - resulted in a finding that all the coordination decisions made thus far are unlawful."
"That would not only harm Parliament tremendously, but it is also unnecessary from a political point of view."
"I therefore ask the Bureau, in urgent terms, to put in place appropriate measures to end this discrimination against non-attached Members and return to the sound working methods of the last ten years."
"(ES) Mr President, this summer, the terrorist group ETA murdered three people in Spain, three people who defended law and freedom: an officer of the national police and two officers of the civil guard."
"I would like to express our solidarity, support and care to their families."
"ETA is a criminal group that has no place in Europe, because in the European Union there is no room for radicalism, totalitarianism or terrorist murders."
"The European Parliament and all the European institutions should therefore continue to condemn the ETA terrorists and continue to work to remove and eradicate the cancer of terrorist attacks by ETA and its accomplices from our continent"
"I therefore want my first speech in this first ordinary plenary sitting of the European Parliament of this legislature to remember and pay tribute to all the victims of ETA terrorism, to condemn the terrorist organisation ETA in this House and to ask that, as Europeans, we all work together, with the law on our side, to smoke out ETA and its supporters, for the good of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe."
"Mr President, personally I think that the time has come to make a shift in our approach to energy problems, namely by gradually shifting the emphasis from 'energy security' - that is, trying to secure our current deliveries from volatile suppliers - to 'secure energy', meaning the full exploitation of the energy sources firmly under EU control."
"Of course, this will require parallel action in both directions for some time until the scales tip in the direction of the latter because, indeed, if Europe really wants to become a truly credible international actor as such, it should first achieve control over its energy supply."
"Otherwise, it will continue to be a collection of national actors, each pursuing its own national interests, and thus vulnerable to the divide-and-control tactics of ruthless external suppliers."
"Mr President, six months ago the world was shocked by the death and destruction visited by Israel upon Gaza."
"Now the cameras have gone away, yet the economic siege continues."
"Less than one quarter of the materials and supplies needed by the people there are getting through the checkpoints - just 18 items in all."
"Nothing for reconstruction, nothing for business, nothing that creates jobs or offers hope."
"Israel is, in effect, keeping one and a half million people in a form of prison camp, surrounded by walls, patrolled by armed guards."
"Mr President, I ask you to convey to the President that he should visit Gaza at the earliest opportunity to judge the situation for himself."
"If he believes that such collective punishment cannot be acceptable, he should speak out on behalf of the innocent."
"(DE) Mr President, the economic crisis has hit agricultural production hard."
"The situation in dairy farming, in particular, has deteriorated drastically over the last 20 months."
"With prices below EUR 0.21, farmers have to sell their milk at a price that is less than their production costs."
"The survival of many family-run farms in the EU is in grave danger, and at present many of them are only able to survive by relying on their personal savings, something that is clearly not sustainable."
"The Commission's figures provide a dramatic picture of the fall in prices for milk and milk products."
"The support measures for dairy farming are vital in order to prevent a collapse in agriculture."
"Quality has a price, but this principle no longer seems to apply in the agricultural sector."
"At present, the producer price bears no relation to the consumer price."
"Our family-run farms urgently need market support measures."
"This is about ensuring the security of Europe's food supply."
"Above all, we must not forget that hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe depend on agriculture functioning."
"(PL) Mr President, tomorrow, Mr Barroso is going to seek our support in his bid to secure a second term in office."
"I would like to remind the House that Polish shipyard workers appealed repeatedly to the Commission, calling for a decision that would save their workplaces."
"No help was forthcoming, because under Mr Barroso's leadership, the Commission has demonstrated a total lack of concern for the problems affecting working people."
"Thousands of Polish shipyard workers are still suffering the painful consequences of the Commission's antisocial policy for their communities."
"We would do well to remember that we have been elected to this House to represent the citizens, yet this is neither the kind of policy nor the kind of Union our constituents expect."
"If we support Mr Barroso, nothing will change."
"The Commission's activities and its legislative initiatives will become further and further removed from Europe's needs."
"We need to appoint a President and Commissioners who will ensure that social aims take precedence over economic ones."
"We need to opt for a social Europe in which the fate of working people is deemed to be just as important as profit."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not allow ourselves to be seduced by sweet talk used as a smokescreen to conceal ruthless and inhumane right-wing policies."
"Mr President, I want to raise the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos, who is in prison in Greece."
"His family, who are my constituents, are convinced of his innocence."
"At the beginning of this year, I wrote to the Minister of Justice in Athens raising the case."
"I did not get a reply, so in a one-minute speech here in May in this Hemicycle I raised the question."
"Immediately after I had spoken, the Greek Permanent Representation rushed to my office and promised me an immediate reply from the Minister in person."
"Four months later: nothing."
"If the Greek Permanent Representation is listening to us now in the Hemicycle, I would like to express my surprise and dismay that nothing has happened."
"Would they please get me a reply from the Minister and look at the case of Mr John Zafiropoulos again?"
"Mr President, during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, a Turkish journalist photographed 14 Cypriot soldiers surrendering to the Turkish army."
"This photograph became the symbol of the search for the fate of the missing persons."
"The soldiers' bodies were identified through DNA a few weeks ago after they were killed 35 years ago and thrown down a well in the occupied northern part of the island."
"This demonstrates the blatant violation of the Geneva Convention by the Turkish Army, who were responsible for prisoners who surrendered to them."
"I urge this Parliament to call on Turkey to cooperate with the UN Committee on Missing Persons by providing its records and by opening two recently designated plots in Lapithos, called 'restricted military areas', where another 800 prisoners are believed to be buried."
"Mr President, this Parliament will have many important discussions, and decisions to make, on budget matters."
"Currently we are, of course, looking at the 2010 budget, and there are still a lot of issues to be resolved before we can agree that."
"This Parliament will also soon start discussing the new financial perspective for the period post 2013."
"But there is also the mid-term budget review, and it seems to me we have almost forgotten about that."
"We should not forget about it, because this will give us great opportunities in the future."
"It will give us the opportunity to look again at what our priorities are."
"It will give us the opportunity, for example, to put more funds into a new economic regeneration plan for Europe."
"It will also, perhaps, give us the opportunity to put extra funding into the measures which come out of Copenhagen at the end of this year."
"I believe that this Parliament should not take its eye off the ball."
"This Parliament should continue to press the Council and the Commission to make sure it looks again at that mid-term review and to give us the opportunity to put forward our priorities."
"(HU) Freedom of speech, Mr President, including the freedom to choose the language you wish to speak, is a fundamental human right."
"A language is a symbol of paramount importance to the people who speak it, the basis for their self-identity."
"Anyone who thinks this of their own language must respect the language of every other community."
"However, one of the EU's official languages, Hungarian, has recently come under attack in Slovakia, in a way which goes completely against the European mindset."
"Its language law blatantly discriminates against the right of the half a million-strong Hungarian community to use its own language."
"In some cases, a fine of EUR 5 000 may also be imposed."
"The European Union is committed to cultural and linguistic diversity, and a commissioner for multilingualism was even appointed with this in mind."
"The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which has also been ratified by Slovakia, guarantees the right of citizens to use their mother tongue at every education level, for administrative matters, in public institutions and official documents."
"The only mainstay of the EU institutions cannot allow one of the Member States to blatantly contravene fundamental EU norms and launch an attack against minority rights without speaking out."
"(PL) The House debated the situation of the Polish shipbuilding industry a few months ago."
"Agreement was reached."
"Mr Schulz, the chairman of our political group, confirmed on behalf of the group that Parliament did not consent to doing away with tens of thousands of jobs in shipyards and at the undertakings supplying them."
"Mr Schulz confirmed that the House did not agree with closing down this industry in Poland, or with the consequent reduction in Europe's industrial capacity."
"Six months have elapsed and the situation is as follows. The government has been unable to privatise the shipyards, the Commission has taken no account whatsoever of Parliament's position, the yards are not producing, the future is uncertain, people have lost their jobs and have been left in limbo."
"We must surely all agree that this Commission lacks any concept of a European industrial policy, and has failed to understand that ships were needed in the past, that they are needed now and that they will continue to be needed in the years to come."
"Mr President, 23 August 2009 marked the 70th anniversary of the infamous Nazi-Soviet Pact which divided Europe."
"I think that this is a shocking example of how close seemingly opposite political extremes can become."
"Both Moscow and Berlin then agreed that the first task was to bring down the democratic political order in Europe; both Moscow and Berlin sought to achieve the domination of the world."
"Therefore, we should never forget that it took two dictators to launch World War Two."
"Stalin, four days before signing this pact, explained the point of it to his comrades: 'It is in the interests of the Soviet Union that war breaks out between the Reich and the capitalist Anglo-French bloc."
"Everything must be done so that the war lasts as long as possible in order that both sides become exhausted."
"Then we would have a large arena to develop the world revolution.'"
"I would like to remind Members of the European Parliament resolution of last April to mark 23 August as a joint day of commemoration for victims of all totalitarian regimes."
"(SK) Both in the last session of parliament and in the current one, we have heard speeches by many Hungarian MEPs criticising the Slovak language law."
"I would like to mention at the same time that you have all been sent documents containing various arguments, the majority of which, to put it plainly, amount to misinterpretations, fabrications and even deliberate lies."
"The Slovak language law fully complies with all the human rights issues and with the rights protecting minority languages."
"In my opinion, the Hungarian MEPs are pursuing a very dangerous policy of pointedly and directly provoking extremism, both in Hungary and in its neighbouring states."
"In my opinion, they ought to realise that this is a highly dangerous policy and, as we have heard today, they should call a halt to these fabrications."
"(SL) I have received requests from a large number of Slovenian and Italian citizens asking me to draw this House's attention to Italy's intention to build a gas terminal in the Gulf of Trieste."
"I share the concern of Slovenian and Italian environmental organisations that this gas terminal could place a major burden on what is already a very environmentally vulnerable area."
"I refer here to the seas of the Gulf of Trieste and its large urban hinterland."
"These organisations have also expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the documents used in the environmental impact assessment."
"I also call on the governments of Italy and Slovenia to work together on this project in the spirit of the memorandum they signed in September last year."
"In other words, I call on them to work together on environmental impact assessments in the northern Adriatic, and the Gulf of Trieste respectively."
"I also expect that, as a result of carrying out such an assessment, the governments will be able to agree on a more appropriate site for this gas terminal than the Gulf of Trieste."
"(FI) Mr President, I agree with my Estonian colleague, Mrs Oviir, that the economic crisis is far from over."
"A peculiar kind of optimism is emerging everywhere in Europe, even though unemployment is on the increase, national economies are running into debt, the population is ageing, and a sort of triple guillotine is hanging over Europe, and despite all that, the recession has been declared over."
"An exit strategy is being planned, as is how we need not bother to continue with the recovery strategy."
"Europe began the recovery strategy and dealing with the economic crisis very well and in an exemplary fashion, to the extent that the United States of America learned a lesson from Europe and followed its example, but after that, Europe slowed down completely."
"Furthermore, this false optimism is also leading to the wrong solutions."
"The economic crisis has not been beaten."
"(RO) The formation of the Alliance for European Integration, in the wake of the early elections held in July 2009, reconfirms the pro-European commitment of the Republic of Moldova's citizens."
"An extremely important step has been taken, which Moldova and the European Union cannot afford to mishandle."
"The political situation is still fragile."
"This is why the success of the alliance and, by implication, of a democratic Moldova, depends hugely on the support of its European partners."
"Moldova has assumed the responsibility of committing to a pro-European course."
"The European Union's responsibility is to facilitate its course on this path."
"The Moldovan people's choice of the European option is now also shown at a political level."
"This is why we must give our unconditional support to the Alliance for European Integration in the Republic of Moldova, as it represents the only chance for integrating it gradually, yet quickly, into the European family."
"I call on the European Commission to negotiate the signing of a new agreement with the Republic of Moldova as a matter of urgency and to use all the necessary resources to help this republic emerge from the difficult financial situation it is in."
"(HU) The European Union's credibility is completely undermined if it only speaks out in the case of human rights violations happening outside the EU, but makes no protest in the case of a serious human rights violation like the one which has just taken place in Slovakia as a consequence of the national language law and has also triggered unparalleled tension in relations between the majority and minority communities."
"The minority language has been subordinated to the majority language, as Mr Vollebaek, the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, also put it."
"I would like to point out to my colleague, Boris Zala, that we would be very happy not to have to raise the issue here in the European Parliament."
"I have done so only as a consequence of the fact that a law has come into force in Slovakia which severely restricts the use of minority languages and discriminates against the Hungarian community living there."
"This is why it will be the responsibility of the next Commission and Mr Barroso to set up forums where these cases can be examined, as Leonard Orban has also stated in his letter."
"Slovakia must honour its international commitments, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
"(PL) Mr President, I asked for the floor in order to refer to the mission to Afghanistan."
"This subject is fraught with difficulties for all concerned."
"NATO and the European Union are both affected."
"In particular, I wanted to highlight the need to place greater emphasis on the requirement for humanitarian, social and economic aid for the Afghan people, who have unfortunately been subjected to the effects of war for 30 years."
"I raise this matter against the background of an escalation of actions involving attacks on soldiers in the context of the presidential election."
"As we are all aware, these attacks have become increasingly frequent and violent in the run up to the election."
"Such aid is particularly important in the context of developing trust and reconstructing the country."
"Captain Daniel Ambroziński of the Polish Armed Forces lost his life recently in Afghanistan."
"It appears that his death was due essentially to the weakness of the Afghan Army and police, who succumbed to bribery."
"It is well known that the Afghan Army and police force are in a difficult financial situation."
"According to the media, Afghan soldiers are lucky if they earn USD 20."
"It is important for the military effort to be accompanied by social, humanitarian and economic aid."
"Twenty seconds for Mr Kelly, for a very brief rejoinder."
"Mr President, I just want to say very briefly that an erroneous and somewhat condescending statement was made this evening about the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland by a British colleague."
"Ireland has not been forced by anybody to vote a second time on Lisbon."
"It was a decision taken independently by the Irish Parliament and will be carried out independently by the Irish people."
"In fact, we have not been forced to do anything since we gained our independence from Britain in 1922."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have had 39 speeches in 45 minutes."
"I believe that is a fine performance - this has been a good debate - and I offer my best wishes above all to all those who have made their first speech."
"I would like to stress, in particular, the need for the Commission to take account of the comments that were made in the debate, or else our Parliament will just be a place to let off steam."
"The Commission has been attentive."
"I noted that our Commissioners were very attentive, and so they will doubtless follow up the comments made by all of our fellow Members."
"Restructuring of the European car industry, in particular the Opel case (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the restructuring of the European car industry, in particular the Opel case."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am very grateful that you have given me the opportunity today to comment on the situation in the European car industry in order to inform you of a number of aspects of our European response to the crisis and of the developments in relation to the General Motors Group."
"In so doing, I will comment on the industrial policy and social aspects, while my fellow Commissioner, Neelie Kroes, will take over when it comes to State aid law."
"Twelve million workers have a job that is directly or indirectly dependent on Europe's car makers."
"That is why, back in October 2008, the Commission met with all the parties involved - including both the Member States and the social partners - as part of the CARS-21 process, to discuss a common way to manage the crisis."
"The scrapping premiums and additional financial aid from the European Investment Bank (EIB) were discussed at the meeting, so as to prevent this important sector, from an employment policy point of view, from foundering in the maelstrom of the crisis."
"We also need to act in order to ensure that the crisis does not jeopardise the achievement of our statutory requirements to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars by 2012. I will come back to this later on."
"Out of concern about developments relating to General Motors, the Commission called a political meeting of all the Member States back in January this year in order to provide transparency and to guarantee compliance with European legislation."
"Three such meetings have since taken place."
"Joint political arrangements were reached amongst the 27 Member States at these meetings, and these were also made public."
"The first policy agreed was that a trusteeship solution coordinated by Germany was the right way to go in order to protect General Motors Europe from the insolvency of the US-based parent company."
"We are now in a position to say that this trusteeship solution prevented GM's European car factories from being dragged into insolvency with the parent company."
"The next point agreed was that the trusteeship solution did not mean any prejudging of which bidder was to take over the company."
"As concerns the range of bidders, the Commission declared from the very start that it would be neutral as it would otherwise be unable to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties."
"It was also agreed that all national protective measures would have to be fully in compliance with the provisions of the EC Treaty on State aid and the internal market."
"Furthermore, State aid must not be made contingent upon political conditions such as the site of investment."
"The EU Treaty leaves no room for economic nationalism."
"Public money may only be used on an exceptional basis and only where future-oriented economic structures with future-safeguarded jobs result."
"All decisions must follow economic logic alone but, as I said earlier, when it comes to issues of State aid, Commissioner Kroes will go into detail later on."
"The fact that GM will retain 35% of the shares is a clear indication that it is counting on the economic comeback of its former European subsidiary."
"I also welcome the fact that 10% of the shares will remain in the hands of the employees."
"The Commission has been talking to all those involved, both at the working level and the political level, since January 2009."
"All the Member States - and today the Flemish Minister-President, too - welcome and support the Commission's position on the future of General Motors Europe."
"The Commission has all the tools to ensure that all the agreements are observed."
"I will stress one more time that we will not allow taxpayers' money to be used according to short-term political considerations rather than the long-term interests of sites and jobs."
"In times of crisis, it is natural that many people would say that charity begins at home."
"As the Commissioner responsible for social affairs, I do hope, however, that Magna, along with GM and New Opel, will find a European solution."
"The debate about the future of General Motors Europe must not prevent us from seeing that the situation facing the European car market overall is a drastic one."
"Even before the crisis, there were overcapacities."
"This situation has been exacerbated by the crisis."
"In the last quarter of 2008, the number of registrations fell by nearly 20%, and we are expecting a fall of 11% for 2009 as a whole."
"The scrapping premium, which 12 Member States have adopted, has ended the freefall, but only on the passenger car market."
"We pointed out the extremely difficult situation in the entire goods vehicle sector back in January 2009."
"The sales figures are catastrophic."
"There are no figures in sight showing a recovery."
"There are serious consequences for the entire supply industry."
"The primary responsibility for managing the crisis obviously lies with the automotive industry itself."
"In order to protect the workers affected, the EIB, Member States and the Commission have provided financial means so as to soften the social consequences in the sector."
"The European Globalisation Fund adopted by the Commission two years before the crisis has received seven applications from six countries from the automotive sector over the last two years."
"With around EUR 40 million, we are helping around 7 000 workers back into the labour market."
"We have also provided a forum to discuss the necessary next restructuring steps, which must be implemented in a socially responsible manner."
"We welcome the fact that many car makers have been able to prevent dramatic job cuts by implementing short-time working and other forms of flexible working - mostly agreed between the social partners."
"There is agreement between all those involved about the long-term prospects of the European car industry - namely that we must build the most advanced vehicles in the world in Europe, in other words, the cleanest, the most energy-efficient and the safest."
"This strategy means that it is necessary to take a leap forward in terms of automotive technology."
"We are helping bring this about through the EIB and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"The Commission will also continue to do all it can to provide reliable basic conditions for this key European industry and those employed in it."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the public financing of Opel/Vauxhall by one or more European governments is the issue that I will address."
"As you know, last Thursday, the Opel Trust, in which General Motors (GM) and the German authorities have equal representation, announced that it has approved the sale by GM of a majority stake in its European Opel/Vauxhall operations to the consortium of Magna International and Sberbank."
"This decision by the owners of Opel has been supported by the German Government."
"The German Government promised to grant public funds of up to EUR 4.5 billion to the new Opel, with the possible participation of other European governments."
"Mr President, the Commission has kept in touch with all the Member States concerned throughout the process which led to this transaction and the Commission is also aware of the controversies regarding the respective merits of the restructuring plans presented by different bidders, including the doubt publicly expressed by certain members of the Opel Trust."
"Concerning the public financing of the GM/Magna transaction, we have been informed that the German Government intends to avail itself of a pre-existing approved scheme under the Commission's temporary framework for State aid measures to support access to finance in the current financial and economic crisis."
"Mr President, I intend to verify carefully whether this scheme can be used in this case and you will certainly understand that I cannot take a position at this stage since the deal is not yet finalised and, by the way, a number of aspects are still being negotiated."
"However, at this moment, it is quite important that I should outline to you the most relevant considerations."
"In particular, I have to underline that State aid granted under the temporary framework cannot be subject, de jure or de facto, to additional conditions concerning location of investments or the geographic distribution of restructuring efforts."
"Such conditions would create - and I am quite clear on this - unacceptable distortions in the internal markets and could trigger a subsidy race which would significantly damage the European economy at the present, very delicate moment."
"Moreover, if the restructuring of a European company was determined by non-commercial conditions attached to public financing, there would be a risk that a company would not be able to restore its long-term viability, and that risk to viability is all the greater due to the current weakened state of the entire European car industry."
"The European car industry, as we are all aware, suffers from considerable overcapacity."
"So a failed restructuring would result in great damage for the company and for its workers, in negative spillovers for the whole sector, and in a waste of taxpayer's money."
"And those principles will be my guidance in my assessment in the Opel case."
"I will verify whether non-commercial protectionist conditions are attached to public funding, de jure or de facto, and the Commission will examine not only the legal conditions that may be attached to a final aid package, but also the entire context in which the aid is granted."
"And I will be particularly interested to find out whether the German authorities have effectively linked the provision of aid to a single bidder and, if so, to find out why they regarded that bidder's business plan as preferable from an industrial and commercial point of view."
"In the short term, it is a sad fact that, because of the current state of overcapacity in the car industry, any plan to restore the profitability of Opel/Vauxhall will require job losses across the company as a whole and planned closures; all the plans to save Opel/Vauxhall presented by different potential investors have foreseen both plant closures and job cuts."
"However, a social restructuring is the only way to ensure viable and stable jobs for the future, and the Commission cannot, and should not, try to dictate where such cuts will fall, nor can it try to prevent them."
"We will, however, be scrutinising the process very carefully to ensure that it is based on commercial considerations designed to sustain viable jobs and not protectionist motives."
"Mr President, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) very warmly welcome the fact that Commissioner Špidla has confirmed that the European authorities were involved in three areas of this long, drawn-out change of ownership process of a car company."
"As a second point, I agree with Commissioner Kroes that there is a need to check carefully whether there are any non-commercial considerations."
"I would ask the Commission, however, to proceed with the necessary speed."
"It need not necessarily be as quick as in the take-over of Dutch and Belgian banks within 24 hours, while the same process requires 24 months for German banks, but I would still ask that this checking process be carried out rapidly and purposefully."
"My third point is that it is true that there are overcapacities in the market, and indeed that these are on a stupendous scale."
"In 2007, 58 million cars were sold worldwide, while capacities were 72 million. That means that the restructuring of the industry - including with regard to environmentally-friendly vehicles - is in full swing and the parties most affected are the manufacturers of large vehicles."
"Opel is clearly not a manufacturer of large vehicles, but of energy-efficient vehicles."
"Opel has had problems."
"It has made losses."
"Its vehicles perform well, they are technologically sophisticated and I am sure that this company - even if it will not enjoy the market presence of the giants in the marketplace as an independent company - has a chance of surviving if it can succeed in implementing this restructuring plan."
"As far as restructuring is concerned, I have read in the press that only one site would be affected."
"According to my information ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Langen, I am sorry but Mr Méndez de Vigo would like to take advantage of the Blue Card procedure to put a question to you, to challenge you."
"If you agree we can give the floor to Mr Méndez de Vigo, otherwise you may continue."
"Obviously your speaking time will be made up."
"You will have an extra 30 seconds."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Langen said that the Commission study on Opel should be completed within a reasonable time."
"Mr Langen, what do you consider to be a reasonable time?"
"As I said, the process must be allowed to go ahead."
"It must not be obstructed."
"That is, ultimately, the question."
"When I look at examples from the banking sector, where this process has taken years, then a shorter period than we had in some cases in Germany would certainly be appropriate."
"I would, however, like to conclude by saying the following: in total, the plan - if my information is correct - envisages 10 500 out of the total of 50 000 jobs being lost, 4 500 of which would be in Germany, with the remainder across Opel's other sites."
"I believe it is justified to ask the Commission to check whether this is accurate and that it does not take place according to political criteria and, in that regard, we look forward, along with the workers, to what will hopefully be a bright future."
"I would like to thank Mr Langen and Mr Méndez de Vigo because I believe that this was the first test, the first trial of this procedure."
"It is a good thing; it livens up our debates, which have been a little dull at times."
"With interruptions such as this, however, the debate becomes more interesting."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, in this situation, where, after a struggle that has gone on for months, the way is finally open to a solution in which, of the in excess of 50 000 directly-affected jobs, probably - at least according to what the new investors are telling us - around 40 000 can be saved, not counting the many jobs amongst suppliers and in dependent local businesses, it is now time to address the workforce of General Motors in Europe."
"It was their dispute, they - Klaus Franz as the Chairman of the Full Works Council and all the others - became the face of Opel Europe, from a new technology group that has earned its opportunity, and in such a situation, our policy must help."
"What is it that we are discussing?"
"We are discussing how General Motors in the US staggered on for months."
"It came within a whisker - and we know this for certain, ladies and gentlemen - of failing."
"What, then, could have been more reasonable than to have seized the initiative, moved forwards and said, 'OK then."
"We have to jump in here and give people a chance."
"We must give not just the production sites, but also the future technologies, a chance so that Europe can remain a good place to produce cars.'"
"I can fully identify with the outlook that Commissioner Špidla set out for the European car industry."
"Let us make it real!"
"Let us create an industrial policy framework with world-leading environmental standards so that employees and car makers in Europe can develop within them right here."
"We managed it before with coal and steel."
"Why should we not also now succeed in doing it for the industry of mobility and the future?"
"Grab the ball!"
"The Commission has a lot of room to act here, and it can launch a lot of initiatives."
"Commissioner Kroes, according to my information, of the 4.5 billion that form part of the deal that has to be reached, you have already approved 1.5 billion so that the wheels keep turning."
"Naturally, you must check the law and the legislation - what is the alternative?"
"Of course, all necessary steps must be taken to bring about a fair distribution of burdens in the future negotiations."
"I implore you, however, to conduct your checks quickly, to consistently come to a conclusion but, given what is at stake, it is absolutely vital that this opportunity not be destroyed."
"It must not fail on trivialities."
"Instead, we must also note the significance of the situation and we must achieve a European solution, in the public interest, that benefits everyone."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the two Commissioners and the Commission for their statements today."
"It was not self-evident."
"On 3 August, I wrote a letter, as the announcement that has now been made was already in the offing then, and received a reply from the President of the Commission."
"It contained nothing new."
"Today, I have at least heard some clear words from the Commission, through Commissioner Kroes, who states that, no matter what, an in-depth investigation is to be carried out into all the details of this matter."
"Commissioner Kroes, I should also like to request that this investigation be carried out on the basis not only of State aid but also on the basis of the rules on competition and of mergers and acquisitions."
"After all, we are dealing here not only with State aid by the German Government - to the tune of EUR 4.5 billion - but also something that is both merger and acquisition."
"In this field, the rules on competition are stricter than those on State aid."
"Since you mainly talked about State aid in your speech, I would ask you to cover both elements in your investigation."
"After all, with mergers and acquisitions, internal competition between the various plants of the company concerned also plays an extremely important role, of course, whilst State aid mainly concerns the competitive conditions between companies."
"I must say, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that a dossier involving EUR 4.5 billion in State aid and a private contribution of just EUR 500 million is indeed an eye-opener."
"Is this still a rescue operation, or is it what I would almost call a nationalisation operation?"
"Be that as it may, there are indications - and it would be good to gather the information on this as quickly as possible - that not only economic but also political motives were decisive in the plan drawn up by Magna together with the German Government."
"In any case, this should emerge clearly from the investigation."
"Commissioner Kroes, I would also ask that, at all events, this investigation start quickly - I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Langen on this - and that the information not originate solely from the acquiring party, as a dossier submitted by Magna to the Commission is likely to demonstrate what Magna wants it to demonstrate."
"It is hard to imagine such a dossier laying bare, as it were, that the competition rules have been breached."
"Therefore, I think that the Commission must use its competences to obtain information itself from the various Member States concerned - the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Belgium, and of course Germany - so as to enable an objective investigation."
"I also believe that the investigation now to be carried out is exceptionally important, as it will set a precedent for the great many other restructuring operations that will be seen in the coming years during this economic and financial crisis and will have to be made subject to the same conditions."
"That was my first point."
"My second point is that, in my personal opinion, the Commission failed to act properly by not immediately taking ownership of the dossier."
"I think this should actually have happened months ago - incidentally, the first Commission communication dates from February."
"Where transnational restructuring is concerned, I think that the Commission can take direct action and that it was not such a good idea to leave it to a single country."
"European solutions are not developed by a single Member State; they must be developed by Community institutions."
"Therefore, I think that, in the field of industrial policy, the Commission should have played its role better and more quickly."
"Thirdly, I think that it must lose no time in presenting an overall restructuring plan for the car industry, as 35% overcapacity cannot simply be eliminated unless we adopt an overall European approach."
"Mr President, Commissioners Špidla and Kroes, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, we should try to keep in mind, once again, that we in the European Parliament, even if we are arguing in the Opel case at the moment and this perhaps represents a wider disagreement about the future of the European car industry, are actually all united by our concern for the future of jobs in this sector in the European Union."
"Germany's actions should not be attacked so strongly at this point - much as they need to be examined."
"Instead, the governments of the other Member States of the European Union whose production sites are affected by the GM crisis - in other words, the governments of Poland, Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and so on - should get together and consider, along with the Germans, how to make something out of this worst of situations and how it is possible to secure the future of the jobs of the affected people in the factories."
"I think that would be a better approach to take."
"As I say, I believe that we are all united by anxiety concerning the future of jobs in the car industry and I have to say that Commissioner Špidla is absolutely right to say that, despite months of discussions in Brussels and again and again here in Strasbourg and back home in the Member States, the debate is still not where it needs to be."
"We talk, repeatedly, about how we have major structural overcapacities in the industry, yet we do not truly have the heart to actually set the course and put our backing behind how we want to lead this sector politically away from these structural overcapacities."
"We have beginnings, which is a very good thing, I think."
"In many contexts, including in the context of State interventions, we talk about future-ready cars, which is to say, cars that should be climate-friendly and efficient and which should have different, future-ready engines."
"If I am honest, however, I do not believe, in view of the trends in the market, that this will be enough to secure as many jobs in the car industry in the future as we have in the industry today."
"For that reason, the future must at least be discussed in terms of the future of the mobility sector and we must be bold enough to actually now, in these times of crisis, discuss transformations and also act more consistently."
"It is very much right to point out, however, that there really has been no thought put into making the sector future-ready as part of the support scheme for Opel in Germany."
"In theory, that means modern, future-ready cars."
"What about the public transport sector, though?"
"How do we get to a position where, in future, we have better, climate-friendly public transport systems?"
"Who will build better buses, better trains and better lorries in future?"
"Who will ensure that there is a conceptual link between this sector and the information technologies and renewable energies sector?"
"These issues have been raised again and again, but never thought through to the end, let alone moulded into political concepts."
"I would like to use this debate, right now, as the new Parliament begins its work, as the occasion to say that we really must tackle this."
"We really must dare to do much more in this regard, or else we will make ourselves jointly responsible for unparalleled job losses that we will be completely unable to repair with public funds later on."
"Brussels cannot just criticise Germany or other governments."
"We have to have the courage at this point to appraise our own investment policies."
"At least EUR 4.4 billion has flowed into the car industry over recent months via favourable loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"Not a single euro that has been pumped into the car industry from this pot, Commissioner Špidla, was linked to requirements for such a transformation of the car industry or the mobility sector to make them future-ready."
"Madam President, Commissioner Kroes, Commissioner Špidla, in my speech here in the European Parliament, I would like, as a member of the ECR group, to talk very briefly about the current situation in the car industry, particularly from the perspective of the future competitiveness of European producers."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Kroes for her approach to the highly complex issue we are debating today, which will create an enormously complex environment for solving such economic situations in the future."
"The global economic crisis has affected many areas of the economy."
"Car production is among the areas worst affected."
"This may be due to the fact that the car industry is a point of convergence for many different areas, exerting huge demands for quality and incredible competitive pressures, together with pressure for technological progress and innovation."
"Anyone who cannot manage the dizzying pace of modern technology is in serious trouble and that is precisely what we are seeing today."
"US car makers are a case in point."
"I would go so far as to say that the crisis has clearly identified those that failed to predict how cars would develop as well as those that invested wisely in the development of new competitive models when times were good."
"I remain fundamentally opposed to targeted government intervention, which can only solve the short-term financial problems of individual domestic producers."
"I understand politicians' fears regarding rising unemployment levels in certain areas but I am sure that it would be very unwise to rely solely on injections of funding into a single sector, as this simply postpones the day of reckoning, often at the expense of those that are operating in a sensible way."
"The global crisis can also be a major stimulus for the creation of new technologies and the use of new fuels such as compressed natural gas, hydrogen or, for example, electricity."
"If the EU wants to stimulate and support European producers, it should therefore support research and simplify innovation procedures which - we must acknowledge - really are very lengthy in Europe."
"I am delighted that EU Member States have headed off protectionist tendencies for now."
"Financial protectionism on its own would simply extend the life of uncompetitive activities."
"Just as catastrophic floods on the Nile brought fertility in ancient Egypt, the global crisis should be an impulse for the development of new European cars that are more environmentally-friendly and highly competitive on world markets."
"I am truly delighted that Commissioner Kroes has taken such a serious approach to this issue, as it will have a very serious impact on all of us in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I share much of what the Commission has put forward here on the causes and the prospects for the car industry - overcapacities, the need to change strategy, new technologies."
"However, I would like to point out that there are a number of things that we do not share."
"Opel will probably not be the last case in the car industry, where there is 30% overcapacity across the globe."
"We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry's economic output."
"In this situation, the Commission shares responsibility for ensuring that the European car industry is able to master this challenge."
"The Commission also shares responsibility for ensuring that Opel does not now become the sacrificial pawn of a free-market clean-up of the crisis."
"The necessary re-alignment of the management of free market forces in this Union will not automatically balance the anticipated job losses with new jobs."
"On the contrary, indeed, those in jobs and European national economies will pay the price."
"The general prevention of State aid will lead to the advent not only of distortions of competition but also social distortions."
"These will then take a much bigger toll on the coffers of the affected countries than they can afford and, above all, much more than those coffers would be burdened by the aid currently being offered, when you include the dismantlement of social services."
"The restructuring of the European car industry needs strong initiatives from the Commission, but also from the relevant national governments."
"We therefore propose a European industry council on the future of mobility involving politicians, businesses, trade unions and academics."
"It would have to develop possible courses of action for the necessary technical changes and define political measures and the associated funding."
"Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens."
"That applied years ago to the steel industry, and it must now apply to Opel and to the car industry in Europe as a whole."
"State aid can and, in my view, must also be linked to achieving an institutionalised employee participation with extended rights of codecision."
"All affected employees in Europe need security for their sites, they need new work and new, secure future prospects across Europe."
"(NL) Madam President, this afternoon - a couple of hours ago - a Magna senior executive reaffirmed what we had already feared, or known: that the Antwerp plant is to be closed down permanently."
"It is true that there is talk of a quest for alternatives, for alternative employment, for a different future for the plant, but no one knows what that actually means."
"It is idle chatter, in a way, and it seems to be a tactic to appease the workers and the many others concerned in Antwerp for the time being: to keep them quiet and compliant."
"I think that, for this whole dossier, the European Commission must not do what it has announced its intention to do, which is to wait a bit more, to spectate and count the blows a bit longer."
"I think that the time for action is now, and that the Commission must state now, more clearly than it has just done, that its approval of this acquisition dossier will be conditional upon the acquiring party applying only objective economic criteria as and when reorganisation operations are required."
"There must also be complete clarity and complete openness as to the competitiveness reports that may or may not exist for the various plants, and as to whether or not the Commission had access to such reports."
"After all, it is common knowledge that the Antwerp plant is very competitive, and it would be unacceptable, in my view, for what may well be the most competitive of the plants to be hit as a result of the massive aid from the German Government."
"With this dossier, the fate of very many thousands of workers in my country is at stake, as is, once again, I fear, the credibility of the European Commission - and I am not optimistic in this regard."
"After all, often enough it is the same old story."
"As Commissioner Špidla pointed out, European professions of faith are many and loud but, when it comes to the crunch, political leaders look after their own country's interests first."
"This was the case in the recent banking crisis and, I fear, is also the case now in the Opel crisis, with German authorities serving German interests first."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the announcement by Magna, Opel's new owner, that it is most probably going to close the Antwerp plant is odd, to say the least."
"After all, we now know that this Opel plant is one of the most profitable, one of the most efficient plants within the General Motors group - and yet they want to close it."
"There is a good deal to indicate, therefore, that this decision was not based solely on purely economic criteria."
"Therefore, Commissioners Špidla and Kroes, we have two requests of you today."
"The first is that you might still use your rock solid competence in the field of competition to ascertain whether the massive State aid promised by some Member States is really compatible with the European rules."
"Commissioner Kroes, you have rightly promised an investigation."
"I hope you are given chance both to carry it out thoroughly and, in the short term, to ensure that we are not soon to be presented with a fait accompli."
"I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that the credibility of the European Commission is at stake here."
"Economic nationalism and protectionism have no place in 21st century Europe, and this is a very good dossier to demonstrate that."
"Commissioner Kroes, you have a reputation as a woman of steel."
"We are counting on you to live up to your reputation in this dossier, too, and ensure that the authority of the European Commission is not undermined."
"I say this entirely without irony."
"Secondly, it is essential that Europe comes up with a new industrial project for the automobile sector."
"We must not look back or focus on missed opportunities, but rather look ahead and focus on the new technology of the new electric car."
"It is not yet too late."
"By doing this now, we can ensure that this new electric car is produced using European technology and that we are not all driving Chinese-made electric cars in the future."
"That is a scenario which it is still perfectly possible to avert."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is actually about finding a common European solution, rather than about national egotism."
"Opel Europe has a significant role to play in industrial policy in Europe and this is not only about jobs at Opel, but also about jobs in many automotive supply companies in a number of European countries."
"The decision in favour of Magna - and the European Works Council has confirmed this for me - achieved a consensus in the European Works Council, too, and its members are working flat out on European solutions."
"The workers are ready to make sacrifices for this cause, and we expect the same from all the decision makers."
"Everyone needs to work together, and to do so quickly."
"Previous speakers have already talked about this."
"In the interests of the workers, it also makes sense, of course, for thousands of jobs truly to be temporarily stabilised with State aid."
"We will not grant validity to any competition arguments that have been put forward."
"We are dealing with people and with jobs, but also with whole regions."
"The path that we were put on under Germany's auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all European workers, across all European sites."
"(DE) Madam President, I'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you."
"I am very pleased, in fact!"
"Most of all, however, I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for having spoken German, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to Commissioner Kroes."
"Many people believe that the Opel-Vauxhall case is a German issue."
"It is not - it is a European issue!"
"It relates to jobs all across Europe, and special treatment here for Germany would not be right."
"I am therefore particularly pleased to see that the Commission is willing to examine this case."
"The issues at hand are questions under European law in relation to competition law and State aid."
"We do want to save every job, but at what price?"
"As counsel for the citizens and taxpayers, it is unclear in the Opel-Magna deal what long-term commitments will be laid at taxpayers' doors."
"The Opel case is also questionable from an industrial policy point of view."
"It is always only the biggest who receive help."
"The smallest and those in the middle are left to look after themselves, yet they are the backbone of the economy."
"The fixation on one investor was clearly a wrong move."
"Better and more favourable offers were turned down early on - and by politicians, in fact."
"The Opel case has more to do with electioneering than with economic and industrial policy that is pure and above board from the point of view of EU law."
"To restate the point, it is important the Commission now plays an active role, even if the German Government does not approve."
"The Opel deal is a sham."
"That is becoming ever more obvious."
"It could mark the most expensive election campaign in the history of Germany."
"We want Opel to survive, we want it to be healthy and we want to fight for every job, but we do not want there to be costs involved, nor do we want a solution at the expense of our European partners, on whom Germany, as the biggest exporter in the world, is also dependent."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today I am somewhat seized by the emotions of satisfaction and fear."
"Satisfaction with the statements by Commissioners Špidla and Kroes, which provide a little reassurance, but also fear, as the statements by the acquiring party, Magna, are not really conducive to any real peace of mind."
"I should like to discuss a number of things that have been said in this debate."
"Commissioner Kroes, Commissioner Špidla, I entreat you: do be men and women of steel, do ensure that all the rules are properly observed."
"Indeed, on the subject of State aid, I must agree with Mr Verhofstadt when he says that the investigation must be extended to all aspects of competition law, to the whole body of law on mergers and acquisitions."
"I think he is right about that."
"I also agree with Mr Langen when he states most emphatically that this must happen quickly."
"What could be done quickly for the banks must also be done quickly in the matter of this acquisition dossier, a dossier that is so important for many thousands of workers."
"I should just like to take up what Commissioner Špidla said about there being overcapacity in the sector - which is true of course."
"He said that a number of methods have been used to set this to rights."
"He mentioned the Globalisation Fund, to which there have been seven applications."
"We should also be aware, however, that this Globalisation Fund is not working very well."
"Tomorrow, we shall be discussing a dossier, a report by Mr Böge, which clearly shows that, of the EUR 500 million that was at our disposal for 2009, barely EUR 8 million has been used."
"We should use such resources to help these workers, therefore, in the form of training, reorganisation and real development towards a new, green economy, one that is low-carbon and relies less heavily on fossil fuels."
"(NL) Madam President, your party leader, Mr Westerwelle, said that one of the intentions with this aid package to Opel was that it form part of the election campaign."
"I hope this is not the case, of course, and I hope that the restructuring of Opel is subjected to normal rules of business conduct and that we do not end up in a situation where everyone puts their own car plant first."
"I have complete confidence in Commissioner Kroes, who is going to examine every aspect of this deal."
"She is known for her ability to stand firm, which she has proved time and again in the Netherlands, and she will not be afraid to make clear statements."
"I do have a question for her concerning the role of Sberbank, the Russian savings bank."
"I am wondering what kind of role this is and whether it will ultimately lead to the relocation of some of Opel's production activities to the Russian Federation, since Sberbank is actually an extension of the government's economic policy by other means."
"Finally, I should like to point out to Mr Staes that he is surprised that this company is under threat, whilst advocating a vehemently anti-car policy."
"Cars are becoming safer and cleaner but are still blamed for everything."
"Cars are the bogeyman, and drivers are squeezed dry as taxpayers - often as a result of policies championed in this House."
"Ladies and gentlemen, cars represent freedom."
"For many people of modest means, Opel represents an affordable brand."
"It is an unfortunate fact that, at present, these people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford a car such as an Opel, and the result is the collapse of car manufacturing."
"This is why I do not think we can express surprise at these developments whilst conducting an anti-car policy in this House."
"My party is in favour of cars, as Mr Verhofstadt, too, is aware."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I have three points to make."
"The first is that the car industry is a key industry for Europe and - this has already been said - when you include all the upstream and downstream businesses and the whole supply industry, 12 million jobs depend on it."
"I just want to emphasise this one more time as Mr Chatzimarkakis is sitting there in front of me, having just said that the German Government's efforts were electioneering bluster."
"I can only refute this definitively."
"It is a mocking affront to the workers employed in this sector across numerous European countries who have to fear for their jobs day in and day out."
"Secondly, rescuing Opel is in the common interests of Europe as a whole."
"I think it is particularly important to stress this, irrespective of the debate today."
"There are sites in the UK, Belgium, Poland, Spain, Germany and other European countries."
"If Opel is rescued by the fact that there is an investor, namely Magna, that there are bridging loans, for which the German Government fought, it is not only in Germany's interests but those of Europe as a whole."
"We must all take steps to retain jobs in our home countries."
"I am pleased."
"Where would we be today if we had not taken steps to bring about the trusteeship solution?"
"There would not be any need for further debate today in that case, as the debate would have been done and dusted in any case when General Motors drew GM Europe along with it into the mess surrounding its insolvency."
"My third point is that there are strict rules for State aid."
"I am confident that the Commission will examine this matter in a proper manner doing justice to the interests involved."
"The crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term."
"I am confident that the solution that has now been produced and on which Magna, too, is working, and which involves many other European States, can be implemented."
"I ask the Commission to also provide the relevant authorisation and I would like to conclude by re-stating that, in this case, we have achieved something positive for the car industry in Europe as a whole!"
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the Commission for its statement."
"Unfortunately, I do not share the optimism of many of my fellow Members - and this goes for the Commission statement, too."
"It is true that we have had some more bad news about the Antwerp plant today, and the fact that a highly productive plant, with a particularly good workforce, is the one earmarked for closure must raise many questions - hopefully also within the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, could it have anything to do with the fact that this plant is situated in one of the smaller Member States and in a region that, though economically strong, is particularly small?"
"The Commission is now congratulating itself on the work it has done over recent months."
"Unfortunately, I disagree."
"You, the Commission, play a role - a necessary role, and one I support - a very formalistic role as protector of the interests of the European Union in terms of its treaties and its rules on competition and State aid."
"I emphasise the necessity of this, and reiterate my support for you in the investigation you must carry out in this regard, as it will be a crucial one."
"Yet why did you not do more?"
"Why did you not assume a strong political role - for example, by also cooperating on ideas relating to restructuring during the talks you held with the Member States?"
"The European trade unions, for example, have been working on, and still support, restructuring, which also incorporates the concept of solidarity, namely ensuring that the suffering is shared among the various plants."
"For the time being, I wish to ask - and this is my most important question to the Commission - what are you going to do right now, following the worst possible news about Opel Antwerp: what steps will you be taking to ensure that the people, the workers in Antwerp, also have a future?"
"Mr President, all of us with car factories in our countries or regions want to see their success, but that should not blind us to the problems and the reality of overcapacity that curbs profits and investment."
"I am hugely impressed by the engineering excellence I see at plants in my region - at Ellesmere Port and at Halewood - and on that basis alone they should prosper, but I am deeply depressed by the attitude of the car industry as a whole over the 10 years that I have seen it work while I have been in this Parliament."
"Judged against the potential for environmental improvement, its record has been shameful."
"Of course, there are positive stories to be told."
"We see examples of innovation in our newspapers each day, but the industry as a whole fought against the introduction of catalytic converters, wildly exaggerating their cost."
"It made an agreement with us to reduce its CO2 emissions and then reneged on it."
"Currently it is trying to wriggle out of legal requirements that it uses air-conditioning coolants with a much lower global warming potential than those used at present, and already it is lobbying to try and weaken the Commission's proposals on CO2 emissions from vans and light commercial vehicles."
"Huge sums of money have been put into propping up this industry."
"I think we, the public, deserve a bit better."
"We hear from the component manufacturers that the car assemblers are too low in their ambitions."
"What we need is for the industry now to take a new attitude, and the industry's representatives - ACEA - in particular."
"We need the industry to recognise that it has obligations to society as a whole and that its future is inextricably linked to environmental improvement."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is clear that even the European car industry cannot escape reality and must be reorganised as a matter of urgency to eliminate overcapacity."
"Yet, of course, the question arises about the credibility of Opel's economy drive if it has pledged to retain its most expensive plant - the German one - whilst an economically well performing plant such as Opel Antwerp is to close."
"Sure enough, this scenario was formally confirmed this afternoon by Magna co-CEO, Siegfried Wolf, at the Frankfurt Motor Show. As various speakers have already stated, there are serious indications that, in exchange for State aid, Magna has made concessions to the German authorities that are not exactly in the interests of the industrial plan."
"I think that the European Commission must put a stop to this before it is too late."
"Commissioner Kroes has already expressed her concern, but I think that more is needed."
"In particular, the Commission must lose no time in stating how it intends to ensure that Germany, too, respects the European competition rules in this dossier."
"As I see it, failure by the Commission to do this would set a bad precedent for all future cross-border restructuring operations, with the smaller Member States repeatedly being driven out."
"Why is the Commission itself not also at the helm of the negotiations with GM and Magna instead of just Germany?"
"I have also heard that, tomorrow, the German Government is to sit down at the table with the other European countries to work out how to coordinate the State aid."
"This does look very cynical as far as Flanders is concerned and clearly comes too late in the day, and I should like to ask whether the Commission is also involved."
"(ES) Madam President, first of all, I would like to express, on behalf of the European Parliament, our solidarity and support for all the workers in all the Opel plants across Europe, especially for those at the Figueruelas plant, the workers and their families and those that are dependent on them in the auxiliary companies."
"I would like to assure them that we are with them in this new adventure that is beginning with the creation of an independent European producer, GM Europe."
"However, in order for this adventure, which stemmed from the bad news of the collapse of GM in the United States, to be an opportunity to build a solvent, modern, competitive business with a clear future from a company, economic and technological point of view, the Commission and the Commissioners themselves need to take the lead again in the current negotiations in order to ensure that we achieve a truly European solution with all possible guarantees."
"We have been criticising the absence of the Commission in the preliminary negotiations and the way that it gave in to bilateral negotiations when every Member State with Opel plants was calling for unilateral solutions."
"In this respect, it should be pointed out that there have even been regional governments, such as my government in Aragon, which was pioneering a year ago when it proposed a guarantee for the Figueruelas plant."
"However, this shift, due to the Commission surrendering its responsibilities, has resulted in the current situation of confusion and a serious risk that election outcomes, which have no bearing on the criteria for industrial viability, will lead the new European company down a dead end in which competitiveness criteria are not a priority and a high cost in terms of jobs is inevitable."
"In order to prevent this from happening, we need the solution to be a European one that is economically viable now, and in the medium and long term, in which employment is prioritised in the form of the competitiveness and productivity of emblematic plants such as Figueruelas."
"We will not allow the Commission to remain neutral for another second longer."
"It needs to act and ensure both employment and the future of GM Europe."
"Parliament is going to demand this on behalf of all the workers of Opel Europe."
"(ES) Madam President, I thank the Commissioners for their explanations."
"Throughout this entire debate, I have been concerned about the link that is being made between the elections in Germany and the situation of this company, which is affecting many plants in Europe."
"I am going to focus on three of the aspects mentioned by the Commissioner."
"I believe that this situation requires complete and absolute transparency in all the negotiations that are being conducted."
"I agree that there needs to be monitoring of all the aspects, both from a legal point of view and from the point of view of aid."
"However, the Commissioner said that she sees restructuring as inevitable, along with job losses and the closure of plants."
"In response to this, which I believe is due to the business model that has been put forward so far and the level of greed that we have in Europe, I think that with this future in mind, we need to put people first."
"We and the Commission need to consider and apply innovative policies, to protect people and ensure they can live with dignity and are given standard training across all European countries, in order to adapt to the future labour market and to the requirements of the new companies."
"Secondly, with regard to aid to businesses, I would like to say that it needs to be aid that makes the remaining plants viable."
"There also needs to be a definite commitment to innovation, especially, as other Members have mentioned, to hybrid technologies, so that motoring does not depend solely on fossil fuels."
"This is therefore what we require of the Commission for the future."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to make a number of comments."
"The first is that, until now, State aid for the car industry and the action taken by the Member States and the Commission have been marked, on the one hand, by what I would call a defensive approach and, on the other, by a short-term approach."
"I believe, for example, that the huge scrapping premiums that we have seen have in fact anticipated and artificially inflated demand, and I believe that it is now that these premiums are coming to an end, or are going to come to an end, that we will see just how much of a false impression they create."
"Demand cannot keep up with supply."
"That is why we would like to encourage the Commission to be far more ambitious in its way of working."
"Where State aid in particular is concerned, I believe that we need to prioritise two areas of action."
"The first is that implementing sustainable mobility solutions in Europe requires the talents and skills of workers - from engineers to manual workers - from the car industry."
"Thus, a first area of action is obviously to help maintain and develop these skills, in the car industry or in related industries."
"Moreover, I believe that far greater conditions should be attached to State aid than is currently the case."
"In other words, it is not enough to say, 'we are going to continue in the same way as before'."
"I believe that State aid should be made subject to the speeding up of change within the industry."
"In this respect, I fully agree with what Mr Davies said."
"I should like to conclude by responding to Mr Eppink, who is obviously claiming that we are against freedom."
"What is, in fact, happening on the market is that fewer and fewer of our fellow citizens are falling into the 'my car equals my freedom' bracket."
"One need only go for a drive on the roads of Belgium or the Netherlands to realise that the system has reached its limits."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe, we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner, Sberbank, on Thursday."
"After months of uncertainty, a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which, for some, is grounds for hope, while for others, grounds for concern."
"We want the conditions of the final contract, which will be signed in the next few months, to be positive for the future of the company, and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company."
"However, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon, where the Figueruelas factory, which is currently one of the most productive plants, is located, I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers."
"There is talk that in its restructuring plan, Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant - currently 1 700 at the Aragon plant - to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added."
"We are aware that in order to save the company, there needs to be major restructuring, and that this will affect our workers, but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria, seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone."
"We trust that, in the coming months, the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe."
"This will mean that together, using economic criteria, we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants."
"Mr Luhan, you had a question for Mrs Lope Fontagné."
"That is why you were holding up your blue card, is it not?"
"(DE) Madam President, I think it is very important that we discuss this issue."
"What has not been addressed so far, however, is dealing with this subject in the context of European and regional development."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"That is not a question for Mrs Lope Fontagné."
"If you want to speak under the catch-the-eye procedure, you will have that opportunity at the end of the debate."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent events concerning Opel make me think of something more than just the acquisition of an historic European car manufacturer."
"I wonder: what kind of industrial policy do we want for Europe?"
"I would have preferred a European group to have acquired Opel; it would have demonstrated cooperation and solidarity among industries in the sector, as well as a strong sense of belonging to the European Union."
"At the 'Etats Généraux de l'Automobile' conference in January 2009, the European Commissioner for Industry, Mr Verheugen, said that the automotive sector was crucial to the economy, society, employment and research."
"I am worried about the possible repercussions in employment terms that this deal could have and I hope that there will be no cuts."
"I am even more worried about State aid, which must not distort competition in the car market."
"The Commission will have to ensure that the aid is not linked to site closures."
"It is a shame that the proposal made by Fiat was not accepted by either the German Government or the directors of Opel."
"Nowadays, Fiat is the most technically advanced vehicle manufacturer - just look at what it has done to reduce the CO2 emissions of its cars."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner Kroes, we are actually looking to you as an arbitrator in this case."
"If I have understood correctly, Antwerp is soon to lose its Opel plant."
"There may still be a plant that is rented out to one brand or another as a subcontractor, but of course, that is a particularly uncertain future."
"As a citizen of Antwerp, what I find especially hard to take is that we have been convinced for months that the choice would be based not merely on economic arguments but on the ability of Germany, the German Government, to put a very large amount of taxpayers' money on the table."
"Therefore, we are looking to you as an arbitrator to see whether this is true, and to work out whether merely economic and commercial arguments were indeed used in this instance or whether it was a case of the survival of the economically or politically fittest."
"When your investigation is complete, we should be obliged if you would set forth your findings in this House."
"After all, we have yet to hear much, or at least anything clear, from the companies involved."
"That is why we are counting on you to enlighten us on the arguments that were used by those involved."
"I should like you to tell me why Antwerp - my city - has been hit hardest, as very many people back home will see this as a symbol of the confidence they can have in the European Commission and in the European Union itself."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the great concern of many in this House about the fate of Opel and the people who work there or make a living in that area."
"A decision in principle has now been taken on the acquisition of Opel, but in recent days and even hours, statements have been made that have caused a great deal of confusion on several points."
"This is draining for the workers and also the people in the supply sector, and clarity is needed without delay - clarity, but, above all, a serious, honest approach."
"What worries me about this dossier in a European context is Magna's announcement that only the Antwerp plant is to be closed, whilst studies have been published showing that this particular plant holds trump cards in terms of business economics."
"Therefore, I cannot shake off the impression that multinationals are playing Member States off against one another, or the other way round: that Member States are using State aid to influence the selection of plants to be closed or saved, in such a way as to distort competition."
"If this should be the case, on top of the economic crisis and its distressing social consequences, we shall find ourselves dealing with a crisis of the institutions - the credibility of the institutions - which will leave people without any point of reference."
"For this reason, I ask with urgency something I have asked before, in a written question in February, which is that the Commission really make use of all the means at its disposal: the means to ensure the victims of Opel's trials and tribulations are not left to their fate, and the means to really set up a formal investigation into the use of State aid."
"This is in the interests of objective, transparent treatment of each and every plant and the people who depend on it."
"After all, people must be able to rely on the European Union carrying out its core tasks even under difficult circumstances such as we are seeing at present, on it taking matters seriously, and on there being no place in Europe for double standards."
"This is really the litmus test for the credibility of the institutions, Commissioners, and we are counting on you."
"Madam President, I believe we all share the same objective - to ensure the long-term viability and competitiveness of the EU car industry and to maintain jobs in the sector."
"In July, I wrote to Commissioner Verheugen and I was encouraged by receiving his commitment to ensure a level playing field in any restructuring plan for the European arm of GM."
"In my region, the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port is the linchpin of the local economy, employing some 2 200 direct jobs."
"The site has undergone radical restructuring and is considered a lean, efficient and competitive operation, as indeed is the Luton site in the south-east of England."
"Nobody wants job losses, but any decision must be based on the viability and efficiency of plants."
"It must be based on fairness, not favouritism, not because one Member State has pledged more finance than any others."
"And I am pleased that Commissioner Kroes recognises that there is no place for political fixes, political strings or conditions in awarding State aid."
"I urge the Commission to be vigilant and to ensure that any financial support is based on State aid rules and the ability of the European operations to be commercially viable and economically fit for the future."
"Maintaining a strong European car industry means taking a pan-European approach to maintaining vital and efficient infrastructure in all Member States and all regions."
"(PL) The question has arisen as to whether the provision of EUR 4.5 million by the German Government to restructure Opel, which was hailed as a success, was a political act or an economic one."
"The best answer to this question was provided by representatives of the German Government when it came to choosing Magna as the entity to take over Opel."
"One representative did not take part in the decisive vote, and another, Mr Wennemer, voted against, because he considered that it was a political decision."
"The European Commission ought to assess the nature of the State aid granted to Opel and inform the House as to whether this was not perhaps a case of protecting the local market at the expense of factories and jobs in other European Union Member States."
"I was particularly affected by the severity of the European Commission's assessments, because the shipyard workers in Szczecin and Gdynia were not granted any opportunity to continue producing ships."
"Will Commissioner Kroes' assessment of this case of State aid be as severe and as reliable as it was in the case of the Polish shipyards?"
"The citizens of Europe suspect that double standards are being applied in this area."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the global financial crisis is now one year old."
"In these difficult times, the European Commission ought to be ready to assist, assess, advise and to propose solutions that are not tainted by suspicions of being driven by the political or protectionist interests of individual Member States."
"Unfortunately, it is my impression that the Commission has adopted a passive attitude in this case."
"(SV) Madam President, we can only conclude that the crisis that we find ourselves in is unprecedented."
"It is therefore necessary for us to have a cohesive and active policy - not only to save the jobs that it is possible to save, but also to help those who become unemployed to get back into the labour market."
"Training will be hugely important."
"The car industry is the engine of the European economy and it is important for decisions to be taken on the basis of long-term goals for developing a sustainable European car industry."
"Differing ideas have been put forward about how job losses and notice will be distributed."
"If it is the case that every fifth job in the Opel group will disappear, then there will be an unbelievable strain on both the people and the societies affected, irrespective of the country concerned."
"I hope, therefore, that the process has been carried out correctly and that multinational undertakings have not had to play off country against country in the bidding process and so play off the workers against each other as well."
"European efforts to counter the crisis must be coordinated and balanced."
"It is also important for trade unions to be involved and for them to be able to participate in the process in an active and constructive manner."
"Furthermore, it is important for the Commission and Parliament to follow the developments closely."
"Research and development will be crucial to the future of the car industry and that applies not only to Opel, but to all vehicle manufactures throughout Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, I greatly appreciate a subject as important as this being debated here in the European Parliament."
"Personally, I worked for more than three years in the automotive supply sector."
"In my home country, we give top priority to foreign investment in the automotive sector."
"I therefore think that the car industry has an important role to play in connection with regional development."
"As well as supporting innovation, we should also create incentives for automotive suppliers and car makers throughout Europe to restructure and expand, as one of the most important objectives of the European Commission and the European Parliament is to ensure a high degree of economic cohesion."
"The Commission should do more, including with regard to awarding grants to the car industry."
"For the time being, this should be regarded as a measure aimed at combating the financial and economic crisis, although it should also be seen as one of the building blocks of innovation in the car industry."
"In this context, Opel is only one example of how this sector is currently on the rocks, but, of course, many car makers are in the same situation."
"That is why we want the Commission to treat this sector and this area as priorities."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is, of course, not the first time that we have debated the subject of Opel and the car industry."
"I am pleased that the rescue succeeded."
"There were other proposals on the table, such as a structured insolvency."
"In the supply industry - and I have just come from Bavaria, where I visited a supply company - people are very urgently dependent on orders."
"Things have got out of control."
"If Opel, too, had been driven to insolvency, things would have been very, very bad and the consequences would have been devastating."
"We have just heard the Commission's conclusions."
"There was a car industry summit, in which the Commission took part, but we actually heard nothing after the summit."
"Today we have heard where the problem may lie. what is not possible."
"That must change in future - we need to hear from the Commission what is possible, so as to forestall nationalistic debates. The Commission needs to mediate more effectively so that we pursue a common European industrial policy."
"That is also what I hope for from the next Commission."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all, I feel I must state that I am speaking from a doubly biased position."
"My wife works in the management of a car company in Germany, and in Austria people are pleased that Opel appears to have been rescued in this way."
"When we look at the events more closely, however, I have great doubts about whether we are not doing exactly what we in Austria have already experienced in connection with the apparent rescue of the nationalised industry and what already happened in Germany in relation to the Holzmann company before a pivotal election."
"I do not know whether there are Members in the House from Germany who would be prepared to enter into a wager with me about whether presumptive German taxpayers would be supporting Opel in this way if such an important election were not taking place in ten days' time."
"I would like the Commission to consider the sine ira et studio, to really think over whether this is reasonable."
"If we are going to constantly talk of competition, then that is what we should have and it should not result in a downward spiral which takes with it those who have actually kept house better, financially speaking, than Opel!"
"(RO) Madam President, we are actually talking about signs of recovery in Europe, but, unfortunately, the situation in the car industry is still alarming."
"This is why I think that we need to send a clear signal to European countries, encouraging them to continue their programmes for replacing old cars heavy on fuel with new cars, while maintaining the incentive programmes from the budgets of the relevant countries."
"Obviously, we must also be able to attach to these programmes certain restructuring conditions with a view to saving energy."
"(NL) Madam President, the provisional solution to the Opel dossier contains good news for some people but, above all, a great deal of bad news for the thousands of people who are to lose their jobs, and I understand from this afternoon's announcement that these will also be from Antwerp."
"This is not to mention the supply chain, where large numbers of jobs will also be lost."
"These are all social tragedies, and I believe that three things are important in this regard."
"Firstly, the Commission must now use all its competences to guarantee that the negative consequences of the announced restructuring take an honest, objective course."
"This is essential to preserve Europe's credibility and to prevent people from getting the feeling that all workers are not equal."
"Secondly, starting now, the Commission must put all its energy into helping to offer a new future in those places where jobs are being lost."
"Thirdly - and this, I think, is the main lesson to be learnt - we need a more proactive Commission, we need a European industrial policy, a perspective on the challenges, the opportunities and the way problems are tackled from a European point of view - and this for transnational industrial sectors such as the car industry."
"Madam President, I apologise for my ignorance."
"I am a human rights lawyer with very little expertise on economic issues, so I have two very basic questions."
"The first is: is there not a fundamental problem with an economic system in which profit is privatised and the costs and the damages are nationalised and paid by taxpayers, most of whom are poor people - or a lot of them are poor people - who have to pay for the bad decisions of a narrow, rich corporate elite?"
"Is there not something fundamentally wrong with this system, and should we not look at the root causes of all that we are talking about today?"
"The second question is - we were talking about discrimination in providing public funds geographically or between nations and states - how about sectors?"
"Is it fair that these big corporations get public funds out of taxpayers' money while small and family entrepreneurs do not?"
"Is this not a fundamental violation of the principle of equal opportunities between economic players in the European Union?"
"Madam President, as the MEP that represents Luton in the East of England, I would like to join my British colleague, Arlene McCarthy, in expressing our real desire to Mr Špidla and to the Commission that they scrutinise this GM/Opel deal line by line to make sure that a deal which is about a European sell-off is a good deal for Europe as a whole."
"I would also like to appeal to him to look in particular at the issues around van production, which is the production within Luton."
"Firstly, because Magna's partner is a Russian truck company, and there are fears that that company will benefit at the expense of the existing production."
"Secondly, because it is expected that there must be a new model in that van market by 2012, and unless Magna give assurances that that new model will be brought on, it does bring concerns about the future of the plant."
"And finally, there are concerns that the deal will not be compatible with the joint production venture between General Motors and Renault, which is half of the production at Luton."
"I ask him to do everything possible to secure that production and the jobs that are associated with it at the same time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate has clearly shown that the automobile industry is one of the most important areas of the economy in the European Union."
"In my opinion, it has also clearly shown that for the automobile industry - just as for Opel - there can only be a European solution and that it is impossible to find a long-term solution within the framework of individual countries which will stand the test of time in economic and social terms."
"There was also a clear emphasis, in my opinion, on the importance of the Commission ensuring that all of the rules are applied completely consistently and in an entirely impartial manner."
"There was much debate over the rules of economic competition, but I would like to stress that Europe is also equipped with a number of very substantial directives focusing on social issues and the regulation of restructuring, as well as the informing of employees and a whole range of issues which we must take into consideration as a matter of principle because every economic operation is essentially a relationship between people and we must take full account of the social consequences of all decisions."
"I would like to emphasise that the Opel case clearly demonstrates all of the important components for the automobile industry in itself and, in my opinion, we can also tell what sort of future the European automobile industry will have from the way that the various European levels cooperate in solving this problem."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it was suggested rather indirectly in the debate that the Commission has not been sufficiently active."
"I have to say that during the course of the crisis, and particularly when it was first erupting, there were very clear manifestations of protectionist tendencies and economic nationalism."
"Several months later, this was no longer an urgent topic."
"In my opinion, we should acknowledge the enormous efforts made by the Commission over this issue, which brought definite results."
"As far as the issue itself is concerned, my colleague, Mr Verheugen, organised two meetings to address the issue at which he brought individual Member States together and one outcome of which was that the Member States shared information, which has not always been the case in previous restructuring exercises."
"In my view, the debate also clearly showed that the European automobile industry is going through a long-term restructuring process, and that this fact must be taken into consideration."
"Future progress has been a central theme and I am delighted to be able to emphasise once again that support is going into innovation in the automobile industry via the European Investment Bank, in order to ensure that the crisis situation does not weaken the industry's capacity for innovation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although the decision that was taken is very significant for the issue we have been discussing, we are nonetheless in the middle of a process and there can be no doubt that the Commission has mobilised all of its powers and resources to ensure that the process has been conducted correctly and with close attention to the social dimension."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am grateful for nearly all the remarks that have been made, for many reasons."
"This is an excellent opportunity to find out where the role of the Commission is limited and where it is challenged, and what the clear purposes of the Commission's policy are."
"I also want to touch upon the time schedule."
"Mr Langen was quite clear in his approach on that as well as on the role of the Commission."
"We are all aware that we are living on a continent - and not just on the continent - that is not only populated with angels."
"The temptation to use State aid in different situations is there, and we are all aware of that."
"That is exactly why judgments on State aid lie in the hands of the Commission - a decision backed by all the Member States."
"By the way, I am still impressed that the founders of Europe in the 1950s were already aware of the pitfalls of using State aid in the wrong way."
"They were quite clear and that statement is still in the Treaty of Rome."
"Having said that, the Commission's role is to verify that no protectionist conditions are attached to State funding and that is exactly where our challenge lies."
"Some of you ask why we cannot speed up, but we are doing our utmost."
"By the way, nationality was never an issue in cooperation with banks."
"We do have examples in the German banking world where the delivery was quite quick with Sachsen LB, but it depends - and in this case too - on the players."
"We need the facts and figures."
"The need to speed up goes without saying: there is no need even to mention it as we are aware of that."
"We will go as fast as the provision of information allows us."
"Having said that, we were also getting your clear line to be very careful and precise and to enter into an investigation to find proof and come back to Parliament."
"I am always willing - and hopefully able - to come back to explain our results, but we have to verify what we find."
"We need to be sure and be in a position to deliver this."
"If Mr Verhofstadt wants us to go even further - not only State aid but taking in merger rules too - then, if Magna/Sberbank is notifiable to the Commission under the EU Merger Regulation, we will assess it carefully."
"I am aware that is also what the honourable Member wants."
"We need to be very careful about replacing an unhealthy but highly competitive industry with a cartel based on market-sharing and price-fixing, as what we try to rescue will end up in a worse situation."
"We take the points about speed and being very careful but precise and going into great depth."
"It is very important to ensure that State aid leads to a proper restructuring."
"That is fundamental and what the Commission is absolutely engaged in."
"The size of the Member State does not make any difference, nor does nationality or the size of the company's dossier."
"We are objective."
"I assure you that I am looking forward to coming up with a proposal where we can say that we did our job, we did it in a proper way and we can assure you that it is viable and that there are stable jobs for the future."
"That is one of the main things we owe to the people who are currently living in uncertainty."
"The debate is closed."
"Forest fires in the summer of 2009 (debate)"
"The next item is the statement from the Commission on the forest fires in the summer of 2009."
"Madam President, I should like first of all to express my support for those who were affected by the recent forest fires."
"This summer, the Community made an important contribution towards putting out the many difficult forest fires which broke out in various Member States."
"The pilot programme of the EU forest fire tactical reserve played an important role and provided assistance to the Member States affected by the forest fires."
"I should like to extend my special thanks to the European Parliament for approving funding for this pilot programme."
"I must also say that this pilot programme is a small part, a partial implementation of proposals and ideas from the report by Michel Barnier, to whom I also express my thanks."
"This pilot programme substantially reinforced the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and, by extension, the facility to assist countries hit by natural disasters."
"The European Community Mechanism for Civil Protection was used by France, Italy, Spain and other Member States of the European Union to provide aerial fire-fighting resources in Greece, Italy, Portugal and other countries."
"In fact, for the first time, two Community fire-fighting aircraft were involved together with Greek, Portuguese and French aerial resources in fire-fighting efforts under a pilot programme to create an independent Community fire brigade."
"On the occasion of these recent fires, many voices were again raised by politicians, scientists, journalists and simple citizens, calling for the creation at European level of a specialist fire-fighting force able to intervene directly and effectively when national fire-fighting resources are insufficient."
"Huge efforts have been made in this direction to create an independent intervention force to fight forest fires and, as I said, the support of the European Parliament was a decisive factor."
"It allowed us to secure funds to charter fire-fighting aircraft and, for the first time this summer, over the period from 1 June to 30 September, we set up and commissioned an airborne fire-fighting force under the supervision of the European Commission, the EU forest fire tactical reserve, whose aircraft were involved in fire-fighting operations in various countries."
"To be precise it was mobilised in six of the nine incidents in which the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection was called upon for assistance."
"In fact, the national airborne resources, be they Greek, Portuguese or Italian, and those that came from other countries, were joined by the purely Community fire-fighting aircraft, which fly under the flag of the European Union, not under the flag of a Member State."
"The aim of this pilot programme was to fill gaps in the aerial capacity of the Member States, not to replace available national resources."
"The reserve aircraft chartered were used this year, as I said, in Portugal, in the south of France and Corsica, in Italy and in Greece, in the area of Attica, where we had major fires."
"They are based on the island of Corsica, which is equidistant for the purpose of intervention from either side of the Mediterranean."
"I consider that there is now an urgent need to create an independent capacity to deal with natural disasters at Community level."
"We hope that this pilot programme will form the core of a future European rapid response force to fight forest fires and other natural or man-made disasters."
"Of course, there are certain differing points of view here on the question of forest fires, with some people citing the principle of subsidiarity in the forest resource management and protection sector."
"However, there are also reservations about handing over more power to the Commission in the civil protection sector."
"Also, there are arguments that the existence of a European fire-fighting force would give a false sense of security to many national authorities, which might neglect the necessary investment required in human resources, in fire-fighting resources and, more importantly, in the prevention of fires and other natural disasters."
"Apart from these reactions, there are a number of practical problems, problems of coordination, especially on the question of forest fires."
"For example, what criteria and what priorities will be used to determine how European airborne fire-fighting units are to be used where fires break out in several countries at once, for example, in Portugal and Greece at the same time."
"In any event, all these issues will be analysed in a report submitted by the European Commission for debate by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on the operation of the pilot programme this summer."
"The Council, the European Parliament and the Commission will all need to be persuaded and to cooperate in the creation of this mechanism."
"Of course, in the meantime, Member States must not neglect in any way whatsoever their obligations in the information, education and prevention sectors."
"I shall say a few more words about the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection, which was set up in 2001, and which made few interventions in the initial years."
"Since 2005, interventions both inside and outside the European Union, with approximately 50% inside the European Union and 50% outside it, have increased fivefold and we have seriously improved coordination and the assistance which we provide via the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection."
"Everyone knows how important intervention was both in the case of the tsunami and during hurricane Katrina."
"In fact, we were the first to send specialists to the disaster zones in both these cases."
"However, as I said earlier, we have a great deal to do and anyone who reads the Barnier report will see how much we can advance civil protection for the benefit of European citizens and, of course, environmental protection."
"Madam President, every year, 400 000 hectares of forest are destroyed in southern Europe."
"This is a systemic disaster of massive proportions and will worsen over the next few decades."
"For 30 to 40 years at least, we shall live, whatever we do from the point of view of reducing greenhouse gases, with a worsening climate which, especially in the south of Europe, where forests are vulnerable, will be a negative experience."
"We will have to face bigger fires and more serious dangers in the future."
"Under normal circumstances, fire fighting is the responsibility and obligation of the Member States and the Member States in southern Europe successfully deal with tens of thousands of fires a year."
"However, every year, under exceptional circumstances, there are hugely destructive fires for which external assistance and solidarity are needed."
"The decision proposed by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is based on these findings and illustrates, among other things, the urgent need for an effective European rapid response force, as mentioned by Commissioner Dimas and proposed in the Barnier report."
"It illustrates the need for flexible and immediate mobilisation of the resources of the European Solidarity Fund, the need to deal with forest fires in southern Europe as a priority under the EU action plan currently being processed in order to adapt to climate change, and the need for the Commission proposal on a European policy to deal with natural disasters to be submitted as quickly as possible."
"For my country, and especially for the citizens affected, it is important that this decision be approved by the European Parliament."
"It is important for this House to demonstrate its awareness of this crucial issue to southern Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, this year, yet again, the history of forest fires has repeated itself for the worse and every autumn we arrive after the break to debate restoration of the areas affected and relief for the victims."
"Again this year in Greece, we are lamenting the hundreds of thousands of hectares burnt and an incalculable ecological and economic disaster, while Spain, Portugal, Italy and France have suffered disasters on a similar scale."
"Commissioner, one thing is clear, and you hinted at it: we appear to be unable to learn from recent past mistakes."
"For at least six years, we have been talking about a common European civil protection force."
"This has been a constant request by the European Parliament, the importance of which, however, has been devalued by mistakes on the part of certain national governments."
"Mistakes in the design and application of pre-emptive mechanisms and preventative measures, an inability or unwillingness to impose strict legislation making reforestation of destroyed areas compulsory and a failure to make use of all of the available Community resources in order to compensate victims."
"At Community level, over and above the civil protection force, direct activation of Solidarity Fund resources and, more importantly, freeing them from bureaucratic mechanisms, must be the Commission's basic priorities."
"Finally, Commissioner, you know, better than all of us, that we face a new generation of fires, so-called high-intensity fires, which are directly linked to climate change and mainly affect forests in the Mediterranean and southern Europe."
"We therefore need forest protection at national and Community level to be redesigned immediately by adapting fire prevention and fire fighting to the new circumstances and integrating these policies into the framework of measures to be set in motion so that Member States can meet the challenge of climate change."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your explanations."
"Indeed, I think that there needs to be a Community policy, firstly to prevent the fires that are occurring, and we have seen that this has happened throughout the summer."
"I would also like to say that I wanted to begin my speech by remembering the four firemen who died in June in Horta de Sant Joan, Tarragona, and paying my respects to their families and colleagues."
"We need a policy of prevention, but also a policy of coordination."
"We should not forget that there is suspicion surrounding many of the fires that have occurred that they are the result of a speculative policy and development intentions."
"I therefore think that we need to work in Europe as well to promote security by investigating and standardising penalties for environmental crimes."
"We should also consider the possibility of pursuing them using a European arrest warrant."
"The professionals need to be given the necessary resources to be able to develop innovative mechanisms for measuring the weather, winds and temperatures so that they can work under the necessary conditions, because ultimately they are protecting us all."
"Madam President, how interesting that it is mainly the Greeks who are speaking on this highly important issue of concern to the whole of southern Europe, given that huge forest fires regularly destroy massive areas and affect the quality of life, biodiversity, regional development and citizens' futures."
"Often forest fires, as was recently the case in Greece, are due to poorly designed and conflicting forestry and housing policies, which encourage arson and illegal action to obtain forest land."
"Unfortunately, both the main parties have tried to mitigate and reduce the constitutional protection of forests."
"The constant pressure for changes to land use, the expansion of residential areas and, of course, the uncontrolled rubbish dumps which are burned or which combust spontaneously, in conjunction with climate change, and which, for some people, are simple alibis, are now increasing the potential for more natural disasters."
"It is therefore important that we focus more on prevention, protection and on prompt risk management, at European level, through coordinated cooperation."
"Within this framework, we must safeguard the application of a sustainable common European forest policy and ensure that funds from the Cohesion Fund, the Regional Development Fund and the Solidarity Fund which are earmarked for risk prevention and management and for the restoration of affected areas are, in fact, used in a rational and sustainable manner."
"The funds disbursed in order to restore affected areas must be used on the basis of rational reforestation measures and scientific studies and we would emphasise that they must be refunded by the Member States where it is ascertained that the forest areas affected have been reclassified for residential or tourist development."
"In the past, even two years ago, Parliament passed resolutions containing recommendations for the prevention of, and prompt action on, natural risks which, unfortunately, have not been implemented effectively."
"We believe that long-term protection of forests and biodiversity is only feasible if viable risk prevention and management policies are applied at national, regional and local level, by actively involving local communities, by keeping people in the countryside, by creating new 'green' professions, though lifelong learning and training, and by strengthening forestry services with the emphasis on voluntary forest fire-fighting brigades."
"Finally, we need to step up efforts to develop more effective rapid response mechanisms to natural disasters by strengthening the permanent civil protection force which Mr Dimas referred to and by making greater use of the conclusions in the Barnier report."
"Within this framework, we are tabling a resolution today before the European Parliament, in the hope that we shall make headway, in terms of joint action and cooperation by the Member States, towards real prevention and management of natural disasters and more effective use of European Union funds for this purpose."
"We owe it to our children."
"Madam President, my country, Greece, has seen massive areas destroyed by fire for the third year running."
"The fires in 2007, which were one of the worst tragedies of their kind, and the fires this year in northeast Attica, illustrate just how scant the fire safety and environmental protection system is."
"I would remind the House that Athens is the European capital with the smallest ratio of green spaces to inhabitants and with the highest atmospheric pollution, and that the fires in 2007 and 2009 have exacerbated the environmental problem."
"Climate change can be used to explain the disasters which have occurred in southern Europe to a degree."
"However, there are also shortcomings in national policies and in the policy of the European Union, inasmuch as climate change has not been properly integrated into the environmental strategy."
"Greek governments allow burned areas to be developed and for national land to be appropriated and EU funds are inelastic."
"This being so, Commissioner, I should like to ask you if the European Commission intends to contribute towards the institutional safeguarding of the forests in the country by immediately mobilising the procedure for drafting and ratifying forest maps which, had they existed, might perhaps have prevented this arson?"
"Does it intend to directly cofinance anti-flood and anti-erosion works to avoid new disasters in the areas affected?"
"Does it intend to finance appropriate reforestation, because there is too little reforestation to replace the damage?"
"Finally, does the European Commission intend to discuss with whichever new government is returned in the next elections in Greece the creation of a city park at the old Hellenikon Airport, which would bring a breath of fresh air to Attica?"
"Thank you very much, and many happy returns to the Commissioner on his name day, as we say in Greece."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to see you here and hear you speak."
"I consider that what you said also answers the letter which we sent to you on the second day of the fires in which we set out a proposal for common action in southern Europe to prevent and fight fires, together with certain other detailed proposals."
"I should also like to add that I am delighted to see that all the MEPs from the Greek parties and the Spanish party have responded to our call for a joint presence in the European Parliament and joint efforts to plan a European strategy to deal with natural disasters."
"Commissioner, it would appear that climate change results in fires and floods and is now a major structural phenomenon, because the fires and floods we are witnessing are a structural phenomenon."
"We must not think along medium-term and short-term lines."
"We need to lay the foundations for a long-term strategy."
"That is why the governments of the Mediterranean states should unite in efforts to convince our northern partners of the need for the mechanism you referred to, both within the framework of subsidiarity and within the framework of solidarity."
"I understand, Commissioner, that you are having problems from northern Europe as far as subsidiarity is concerned."
"I hope that the phenomenon of natural disasters will only affect southern Europe, but I greatly fear that climate change is proceeding at such a pace that we may have natural disasters - of a different kind - in northern Europe."
"So you were quite right to propose that we plan this strategy to prevent and deal with natural disasters."
"For the time being, we have this small unit based in Corsica."
"It worked well this summer."
"The Commissioner for the Environment urgently needs to develop and support this unit in his recommendation on this matter, both to the Commission and to the Council."
"I would call on MEPs from the southern countries to cooperate with their governments and to support the recommendations made by Mr Dimas to both the Commission and the Council, as this is to the advantage of all the countries in the south."
"I have seen the motion for a resolution by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and I agree with it."
"I am delighted that they have moved this resolution."
"I would add something else to this motion for a resolution by the PPE."
"With climate change as the beginning and fires and floods as the result, the Commission should place particular emphasis at the Copenhagen conference on preparing a strategy to prevent and deal with natural disasters, determine the budget needed to cover the prevention and avoidance of natural disasters and therefore strengthen this exemplary EU forest fire tactical reserve unit."
"We expect to see the European strategy to prevent and deal with natural disasters, as a top priority, very high up on the agenda for the Copenhagen conference."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what took place in Greece this summer should never be allowed to repeat itself in Europe again."
"A total of 75 fires rampaged through Greece alone, six of them completely out of control, the worst of them, as we have heard today, north of Athens, close to the capital."
"It is only thanks to the courageous and selfless efforts of the primarily voluntary fire brigades and other voluntary organisations that the fires in many regions were not able to blaze in an uncontrolled manner and that human tragedies were kept to a minimum."
"I therefore have a very high regard for my comrades, the voluntary fire brigades, whose equipment - put politely - was often not exactly state of the art, as we have heard."
"When I use the words 'colleagues' or 'comrades', I do so because I myself have been a member of a voluntary fire-fighting organisation in Austria for decades and so absolutely do feel sympathy and empathy for the efforts made."
"Let me move on to the Commission's observations."
"I think it is tremendous that European action forces should help where local fire fighters cannot manage alone."
"I am, however, also convinced that the old saying 'Help yourself, and God will help you' is an important axiom, and for that reason, I also think it is very important that civil protection mechanisms be built up."
"All I can do in this regard is recommend and urge that use be made of the know-how that exists, especially in central Europe, in Germany and in Austria, which is to say, the nationwide voluntary systems, voluntary fire brigades that have been tried and tested for over a century."
"As a fireman myself, I would also be happy to create contacts with the regional and national voluntary fire authorities."
"In such cases, it is also interesting to do something yourself and if this is seen as desirable, I can offer to carry out a pilot project with our Greek friends on the establishment of a voluntary fire brigade in a selected region or municipality."
"I would also be more than happy to actively help and be involved in such a project together with my colleagues in the Upper Austrian provincial fire-fighting association."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his presence and his answers and for the attention that he continues to pay to all these disasters."
"We did a great deal of work together when President Barroso asked me to draft a report, which he also mentioned, on the creation of a European civil protection force."
"I presented this report on 9 May 2006."
"When I re-read it, and I see all the disasters that have happened, I realise that it is still topical."
"Mrs Tzavela, obviously, it is not just Greece."
"Every country is affected, and I would add that there are not only natural disasters, there are also human disasters, caused by mankind."
"I am thinking of maritime disasters - Erika and countless others - and of Chernobyl-type industrial accidents."
"There are natural disasters other than fires."
"I am thinking of the tsunami."
"One day we can expect a tsunami in the Mediterranean such as the one at the start of the 20th century that totally destroyed the city of Messina."
"Frankly, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tools we are using are not up to these disasters, which are going to increase under the twin effect of global warming and transport."
"Hence the reason why I think we should be more ambitious."
"I am grateful to the Commission, to Commissioner Dimas and to all his teams from the Directorate-General that are putting the civil protection mechanism into operation."
"I believe that we must go further."
"It is conceivable to have enhanced cooperation with those Member States that want it."
"If there are not 27 of us to make up this civil protection force, let us start with 12 or 15 of us."
"Then you will see that this affects everyone."
"When I compile the list of disasters, I can say that everyone is affected: the floods that hit Germany in 2002, the major pandemics and also terrorism."
"That, Commissioner, is why I would like the Commission to take the initiative to go further, to propose that the Member States go further."
"Our Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, will support you in these proactive initiatives."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, here we are yet again talking about fires, because every year fires destroy part of Europe's forests."
"With climate change and global warming, the future does not look any brighter."
"Natural disasters cannot be avoided, but they should be prevented."
"We can do so straight away by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and drawing up a suitable forestry policy that recognises the multiple environmental services performed by forests, particularly as carbon sinks."
"To be fair, the European civil protection mechanism is working better, and several Member States have made great efforts and invested heavily in fire prevention and rapid response fire fighting."
"For example, in my country, Portugal, a plan has been approved that includes the rezoning of the country, the creation of a specific budget for fire fighting, revision of the legislation, and a programme for the recovery of burnt areas."
"Even so, we still have fires."
"All the Member States affected by fires have to do more and do it better, and the European Commission must also adopt the proposals that the European Parliament has submitted in a number of resolutions."
"There are several documents that point to solutions."
"The Barnier document and others submitted by Parliament have already been mentioned here."
"I myself was the rapporteur for a report on natural disasters in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and I have also tabled some proposals."
"Those Member States that blame financial reasons for not being particularly swift in perfecting the mechanism need to be told that prevention works out cheaper than a cure."
"It is also crucial that an international agreement to fight climate change - an ambitious agreement - be reached at the Copenhagen conference and, Commissioner, we are still waiting for a directive on fires, similar to the one that has been produced on flooding."
"(FR) Madam President, this summer, Corsica also fell victim to some very serious fires, just like Sardinia, Catalonia, Greece, the Canaries and so many other regions of Europe."
"Regarding the stricken populations, first of all, our group would ask that European solidarity be guaranteed through implementation of the Solidarity Fund."
"What is the Commission going to do in this regard?"
"That is the first question that I would like to put to the commissioner."
"On 23 July, in Corsica, the heat was exceptional: 44 degrees, very dry air and a very strong sirocco wind."
"In conditions such as that, which will become ever more frequent as a result of global warming, the local resources were stretched to the limit, despite the fact that, in previous years, the weather was milder and Corsica had been spared."
"For me, the lesson is simple: when weather conditions such as that occur, conditions that can be predicted, that can be forecast, we must be able to rely on the backup of a European civil protection force such as the one recommended by the Barnier report, and which will make it possible, in particular, to fight incipient fires before they get out of hand, because afterwards it is too late."
"When fire enters a forest, it stops only when the entire forest has burned down."
"Therefore, for us it is important to go much further than the pilot project that you mentioned, Commissioner."
"What does the Commission plan to do to implement as quickly as possible this civil protection force that will actually rise to the major challenge facing all Europeans of protecting the environment and, in particular, of fighting fires in the Mediterranean region?"
"Is it right that the 2010 budget provides nothing for this force?"
"We have tabled an amendment along these lines."
"Let us hope that the large groups, and Mr Barnier's Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in particular, will agree to help us secure the adoption of this amendment."
"(EL) Madam President, the fires are a deeply political problem which appears in a very acute form in countries such as Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece, with painful consequences for both the people and the environment."
"As far as our experience in Greece is concerned, the fires which raged across north-east Attica, Kithairona, Evia and other areas in Greece, causing incalculable damage, are the result of the arson policy of the EU and the alternating governments in our country, who desire the land, the forests and the mountain massifs as commodities of the capitalist economy."
"This extremely dangerous policy puts weapons in the hands of the arsonists who, if the outbreaks and complaints by inhabitants of the areas affected by the fires are anything to go by, again acted in a concerted manner."
"Let us be clear about one thing: unless the basic problem of the commercialisation and change in the use of land is addressed, no mechanism, however well equipped with the most up-to-date resources, will be able to stop this serious problem, which is destroying the environment and putting a price on the future of the planet in general."
"The first tragic consequences of this policy were seen in Evia on 12 September 2009 - just a few days ago - with the catastrophic floods which swept through fire-ravaged Evia."
"The inadequate anti-flooding works and the unsound soil as a result of the fires, in conjunction with the intensity of the rain, caused one death and massive damage to villages, roads, bridges and other infrastructure."
"The sudden rainfall does not explain this level of destruction."
"It is no accident that, every time there is a natural disaster, it is the workers who mourn lives and see their wretched lives and the environment destroyed."
"There is an urgent need for financing for direct measures to record the damage and compensate the working-class families and arable and livestock farmers affected, without any change in land use, and for the burned areas to be reforested."
"Ownership of large private estates in mountains and forests should also pass to the government and the forests and the forestry commissions should be restructured and improved..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the budget instrument with which the European Union has equipped itself to tackle such an important issue as this is useful - I am referring to the Solidarity Fund - but it is also true that we have been stressing the issue of flexibility ever since 2007, when we felt it was right to criticise the approach used with this budget instrument."
"It is important that the management of this instrument be as flexible as possible, so that it can address problems that change from one day to the next."
"For instance, it is only right that the Member States be asked to provide documentation relating to the events within a short timescale - 10 weeks and no longer - but why, then, is the same timescale not stipulated for responding to them?"
"At the same time, we realise that, although, in some ways, the extent of the damage is important, it must be considered in proportion to what each individual territory is having to cope with, so that we can understand and work out what the different populations need."
"For precisely this reason, Parliament, together with the Committee on Budgets and other committees, has long been making comments which are, in fact, filed for the attention of the Council, but which the Council pretends not to see."
"If the flexibility aspect can be reviewed, it means that the Solidarity Fund as an instrument can be improved and made even more effective, thus enabling it to resolve the huge problems that we will increasingly have to face."
"The request, then, Commissioner, is for full account to be taken of paragraphs 3 and 11 of this resolution, so that the flexibility aspect is seen not as a request by the Member States to be able to do whatever they like to be more certain of receiving a response, but as a request that reads changes intelligently, thereby ensuring that this instrument really is totally effective."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, indeed there is no doubt that progress has been made in recent times, but despite all the progress that has been made, the southern part of the European Union is burning more and more."
"Therefore, the resolution that Parliament has adopted cannot be one more resolution that serves to demonstrate our grave concern regarding disasters elsewhere."
"Forest fires happen for a variety of reasons, but no one can deny that they are fuelled by climate change."
"Irrespective of the responsibilities that may exist in some Member States or in some autonomous regions, it is certain that Parliament must clearly call on the Commission to act swiftly and make available all the resources at its disposal, which are not insignificant."
"The victims, the damage suffered and the need for reforestation do not have any understanding of bureaucracy or of budget shortages."
"We need to prioritise and we need to act which, in this case, means changing strategies, mobilising resources, increasing them and optimising the preventive policies."
"We need to demand that Member States take responsibility if this is not the case, but assume that this is not the problem of a few Member States in southern Europe and that climate change does not only affect some Member States, it affects them all and it is a common cause."
"Therefore, one of the main tasks that Parliament has is to ensure that the European Union achieves clear, firm commitments at the Copenhagen Summit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible, because they are obviously behind the fires, behind their causes, and, in turn, behind the causes of further climate change."
"Therefore, having adopted this resolution, this is undoubtedly the challenge for Parliament."
"However, this challenge for the Commission needs to be met if the Commissioner truly wants to prevent the southern part of the Union, which does indeed exist, from continuing to burn."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in this first plenary sitting of the legislature, we have to deal with this sad and now customary issue: natural disasters and, in particular, fires."
"Once again we are lamenting the proliferation of fires during the summer of 2009, which have caused human losses."
"Twenty lives have been lost, all in my country."
"Therefore, my first thought and my utmost sympathy is for the human suffering caused by these catastrophes."
"I would like to stress the disastrous impact that this type of disaster has on the lives of the populations that are affected, on their economies, employment, natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism."
"In my region, 22 000 hectares burned this summer, half of which were in areas that are protected due to their environmental importance."
"We must respond to these problems without hesitation, the people are demanding it."
"The European institutions cannot be incapable once more of finding an adequate solution for those who are affected."
"We need to be able to help the victims and to pave the way for restoring the affected areas."
"We need to continue to work hard on prevention and to proceed further with developing the European civil protection service."
"I would like to make two calls: firstly, I would like to call on the European Commission to analyse the situation and adopt the appropriate measures to compensate for the social costs inherent in the loss of jobs and sources of income for the inhabitants of the affected regions."
"Secondly, I would like to call on the Spanish Government, which will hold the Presidency of the Council from January 2010. The Spanish Government must be capable of passing on its feeling and concern to its counterparts."
"I consider it essential that it makes it a priority in its programme to unblock the reform of the European Solidarity Fund."
"The Spanish Presidency must also make a clear commitment to developing a common European strategy."
"It must also review prevention measures and the forestry management models that encourage large fires."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who, even in the last few days, has watched with great sadness as one fire after another has devastated vast areas around the city of Genoa, in the Liguria region of Italy, I feel there is a truly urgent need for Europe to pay attention and to intervene in order to prevent these sadly recurring disasters."
"There should be no recurring disasters."
"We should work every day to ensure that there are no more cyclical disasters."
"This is why I believe that Europe alone can and must intervene effectively with binding acts to preserve these precious areas which, each year, are in danger of going up in smoke and which really are the heritage of us all, because it is true that fires are breaking out more and more frequently in southern Europe, and even when it is only a tiny part of this southern Europe that is burning, in reality, it is the whole of Europe that is going up in flames."
"We need to intervene with prevention policies and with suitable forestry policies - and by prevention I also mean intervening by means of a precise, thorough and targeted campaign against all forms of speculation directly or indirectly linked to these disasters - but I think that we also need to ensure broader, easier and quicker access to essential resources in order, at least, to mitigate the devastating effects of these disasters."
"I am referring first and foremost to the Solidarity Fund, an instrument that should undoubtedly be employed more quickly for the areas affected."
"(FR) Madam President, it was in 2001 that we called for a European civil protection mechanism, in the wake of the 11 September disaster."
"Subsequently, we set up a fund."
"Then there was the Barnier report, which stressed the need to show solidarity."
"Today, this solidarity works, but it has to be more effective and we have to be able to move up a gear."
"Two points must be developed."
"Firstly, responsiveness."
"All those people who have unfortunately been affected by these fires deplore the fact that the procedures are often too lengthy and that implementing them takes far too long even though, in reality, when we are confronted with fires, we have to move very fast."
"We certainly need to be more flexible, to have more flexibility to implement these procedures, because time is precious in this case."
"And then, there is prevention."
"We do not talk enough about prevention, because it involves the principle of subsidiarity."
"We are told that it is the Member States that must decide."
"Yet, when these fires harm biodiversity and the environment, when they affect the things most precious to humans, that is, their property, their possessions and their homes, and when they sadly cause the loss of human lives, we have no right not to make provision for such prevention."
"That is a criminal act."
"This must stop, and to stop it we also need financial resources."
"It is absolutely imperative, then, to provide ourselves with the best possible budgets, so that we are far more effective within the context of this European civil protection mechanism."
"Let us therefore ensure that the budget - our budget - genuinely takes account of this problem."
"All of this also demands that we take a specific approach to our agricultural and forestry policies, and this is something we do not talk about enough."
"Prevention, responsiveness and resources: in short, everything needs to be done to ensure that southern Europe will no longer inevitably be like a cat on hot bricks."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, yet again this year, southern Europe was impossibly hard hit by destructive fires, and fires of similar proportions also broke out in the USA and in other countries in the developed and developing world."
"There can be no doubt that climate change is threatening the forests of the Mediterranean and other key areas of the planet."
"However, the destruction of forests in the Mediterranean is destroying the ability of natural ecosystems to act as natural carbon dioxide sinks."
"European polices to prevent and deal with forest fires are needed, as is financial support from the European Union for the countries, such as Greece, that face the worst repercussions this year."
"There can be no doubt that, in certain countries, there were massive shortcomings in coordination between the forest protection and civil protection mechanisms, and in taking preventive measures, and this must never be repeated."
"It would also appear that forests within three hours of large towns or tourist areas are often threatened by fire."
"A lot of people feel that they can derive personal gain from destroying forests."
"They can 'plant' houses and other buildings more quickly than Member States and natural ecosystems can plant trees on burned land."
"There are often national laws which cultivate such attitudes and send out the wrong messages."
"A European policy on the protection of forests, on the restoration of burned land, on the forestation of areas, within the framework of European assistance in combating climate change, is absolutely necessary, as is coordinated European action to prevent and fight fires, restore forests and establish new forest areas."
"We need to set this in motion immediately, especially in the run-up to the negotiations at the Copenhagen conference, which will be decisive for the future of our planet."
"We shall be asking developing countries to protect the rainforests; we shall address the key issue of how the destruction of forests accounts for 20% of emissions of greenhouse gases."
"We must therefore be the ones who set an example, by ensuring there is absolute protection for forests under threat, for our forests under threat in Europe, which are the Mediterranean forests."
"(DE) Madam President, the scale of the forest fires actually exceeds the capabilities of the smaller Member States, especially in those regions particularly affected by drought."
"That, of course, is why Parliament supports the European Solidarity Fund."
"We call on the Council to finally release these funds without obstacles."
"The regions need the money urgently for reconstruction and for prevention."
"The Solidarity Fund, in conjunction with existing environmental and agricultural programmes, could help on a truly lasting basis."
"Apart from that, however, fire fighting is primarily a national competence."
"Harsher punishments for those who start fires, development freezes that last for something like 30 years where arson is proven, training of fire brigades - more can and simply must be done in this regard."
"Europe, too, must do more, however, above all, in terms of better coordination."
"The know-how of European fire brigades must be transferred to regions with high levels of susceptibility to disasters, and we need better rules for the running of cross-border operations."
"We await proposals from the Commission in this regard, but these should not interfere with the competences of the Member States. That point - not interfering in the competences of the Member States - is something that I believe is extraordinarily important."
"It is definitely possible to think of European fire brigades and European aircraft, but only once all national capabilities have been optimised and financial assistance for the affected regions has finally been effectively achieved."
"I think it is too early to be discussing disaster prevention as a European competence."
"Let us take the first step before the second."
"Let us do the most important things first, and that means measures ranging from European help to self-help, including by means of the Solidarity Fund, with training and improved European coordination."
"(ES) Mr President, firstly I would also like to express our sympathy and care for the victims and their families, because it is true that every summer we have to lament this situation."
"This is why it is increasingly important that Europe finally equips itself with an efficient instrument."
"We think, perhaps because I belong to the transport sector and I am an expert in road safety, that perhaps, Commissioner, we should consider something similar to the Action Plan on Road Safety."
"A European action plan with objectives, with strategies, in which the improvement of fast intervention within the necessary time window, as is done in road safety, could perhaps help us and also improve working conditions and training for professionals."
"I also think raising awareness and fostering a culture of prevention are fundamental."
"We are gradually achieving this in road safety."
"Why can we not do so in relation to offering protection against fires?"
"We do, of course, welcome the fact that coordination has improved along with solidarity."
"I think that by sending the necessary planes, the Spanish Government has been part of the process of raising awareness among the countries of the south, but this should also be the case between the north and the south."
"We also welcome the fact that the pilot project of tactically reserving fire-fighting planes could, in future, really become an intervention body, which I do think is important."
"However, we still have legislation blocked in the Council, such as the legislation on the Solidarity Fund, and also the legislation on land protection, which we think would be extremely useful."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this summer, once again, the Mediterranean forest was engulfed in flames: in Marseille and in southern Corsica, but also in Italy, in Spain and, on a larger scale, in Greece."
"More than 400 000 hectares of forest and field went up in smoke, causing considerable material damage, irreparable damage to biodiversity, and the tragic loss of human lives."
"Dismayed as I am by this assessment made repeatedly, year after year, and mindful as I am of the multiplier effect of global warming on fires, I call for European awareness of the need for more coordinated efforts and for the pooling of fire-fighting resources."
"I should like to see a huge Euro-Mediterranean cooperation project to combat forest fires take shape under the Union for the Mediterranean."
"I welcome the existing initiatives and, in particular, the European Forest Fire Information System - the pilot project."
"Nevertheless, I call for a reform of the European Union Solidarity Fund so that it will become an effective tool for responding to crises."
"I also call for the strengthening of the European protection force and of the 'EuropeAid' facility devised by Mr Barnier in 2006 for intervention on the territory of the 27 Member States, as well as abroad."
"I believe that one of the keys to the problem of forest fires has to do with information sharing and best practice as regards prevention, and I should like to point out the pioneering role played by the forest fire fighters in my own department."
"I can, of course, provide Europe with this example, which may be of use."
"(FI) Mr President, the past year has been one of the most tragic for forest fires."
"We have lost hundreds and thousands of hectares of forest, especially in the Mediterranean region."
"Conjecture as to the causes of forest fires leads to heated rows as, unfortunately, everyone is aware of their consequences."
"It has been proposed that climate change is responsible for the increase in the number of forest fires and that in Europe, too, we should prepare for longer forest fire seasons than just June to September, which has been the norm until now."
"Summers are beginning earlier and they are warmer and drier, especially in the south, and the risk of fires is therefore growing."
"It is true that, exceptionally, this year there were severe forest fires in northwest Span and in Portugal as early as March, and that conditions for forest fires are therefore favourable, but the problem itself lies not in any progressive change to natural conditions, but elsewhere."
"Environmental researchers have discovered that forest fires in the EU, Australia and California are mainly explained by socio-economic factors."
"They can find no direct link to climate change as yet."
"The key factors in the start of forest fires are construction and the pressures associated with the need for more housing, farming, certain species of plants and trees that have been grown, a lack of knowledge and foresight, and negligence on the part of the authorities."
"For example, insufficient numbers of fire-fighting teams and the inability to solve and prevent crimes that might result in fires are behind the tragedies this summer."
"With climate change, natural conditions will change; that is a fact."
"It does not, however, explain environmental disasters, especially if the same phenomena recur every few years, and that is why we might need to be better prepared."
"It is time the Member States of the Union took a look in the mirror, because in the future, whether or not forest fires occur will depend on us."
"It is one thing to adapt to the changing environment; it is quite another to accept rigid bad practices and be unprepared."
"(Applause)"
"(FI) Mr President, I agree with those here who have said that it is always cheaper to prevent damage than deal with its consequences."
"Most of this financing should go to the prevention of fires and floods in southern Europe."
"In addition to satellite monitoring, we need the same kind of forest fire alarm and prevention system which has worked successfully for many years now in Finland, for example."
"Furthermore, at national level, we need to ensure that the equipment that fire brigades use is up to standard, so that fires can be brought under control as early on as possible."
"The increase in flooding is largely due to climate change, and the best way to prevent it, therefore, is to establish a proper agreement at the Copenhagen conference."
"It is also possible, however, to take action at national level to deal with the prevention of floods."
"We need to practise the right sort of forest policy, forests in mountain ranges need to be protected, and forests with the right species of tree should be planted, so that their root systems can absorb water, ensuring that it does not drain away too quickly."
"Embankments and reservoirs should also be built near water bodies and waterways should be dredged for more effective drainage in times of flooding."
"We need to recognise that these matters are very much the responsibility of every Member State."
"The EU cannot take responsibility for matters that are subject to national decisions or for any negligence that occurs."
"The European Union Solidarity Fund is principally a source of emergency aid, and I hope that the various Member States will be prepared to invest in a long-term forest policy, fire prevention and protection from floods."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, a fire is always a tragedy, a tragedy for people, a tragedy for the environment, an economic and social tragedy."
"I had the misfortune to live very close to this tragedy, to the fire that took place this summer on the island of La Palma in the Canaries."
"I therefore welcome this resolution and I am convinced that we are going to be able to adopt it unanimously."
"It is a complete resolution, which has received many contributions and which, above all, does something important."
"First of all, it remembers the victims, all the victims, and pays tribute to all those who work voluntarily to put the fires out."
"However, it also includes some significant reflections on the importance of drought and desertification in the spread of the fires, and the resulting disappearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year."
"There are also important reflections on the causes that aggravate the fires, such as the gradual abandonment of the countryside, deficient maintenance of the forests and inadequate punishment for arsonists."
"In this respect, we need to act and we need to act firmly."
"The Commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters, and a protocol for uniform action."
"However, aid is also important, for restoration, for re-establishing production potential and for compensating for the social costs and job losses."
"As the Commissioner said, coordination is vital."
"However, there needs to be coordination between the different Community instruments: the Structural Funds, the Solidarity Fund - which clearly needs to be reformed - and their flexibility, and also instruments such as Aid Plus and, of course, the rapid response mechanism that we have already discussed."
"We need to go further in solving these problems, and I sincerely believe that this resolution is the right way to do so."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a time for us to show solidarity, but it is also an opportunity - I would even say an obligation - for us to work on improvements, changes and also adjustments."
"The adjustments needed straight away concern the European Union's Solidarity Fund, so that it can be used - and used promptly - to address these disasters, while the improvements and changes concern forestry policy."
"We need a European policy on forests that seeks both to raise their profile and to prevent fires."
"In many Member States, as is the case of mine, Portugal, there is not yet even a register of all the land, and so we do not know who the landowners are."
"That causes problems in land development, reforestation and fire prevention policy."
"With regard to this prevention policy, I have here a question that is also a suggestion: why not include forest fire prevention measures in the EU's economic recovery plan, the plan to revive the European economy?"
"If we promoted measures to clean up our forests - and, for instance, the product of such measures could be used to produce energy through biomass power plants duly designed for the purpose - if we acted in that way, we would certainly be helping the environment by protecting it and, at the same time, we would be creating jobs which, at the current moment, is another of Europe's aims."
"(NL) Mr President, it is good that on this, the first day of Parliament's session, we are discussing the disasters in southern Europe, and I also thank those fellow Members who have worked on these texts in particular."
"We have here a good resolution."
"First of all, of course, this is a matter of interpersonal involvement, or proximity to the people - as we have always said in the context of our elections - and of solidarity."
"This time it is fires in southern Europe but, who knows, this winter it may be flooding in other parts of Europe entirely."
"We in the Committee on Regional Development have discussed improvements in the Solidarity Fund several times."
"It is absolutely not our intention to ask for new instruments, but rather to improve the ones we already have, making them more efficient."
"Now, Commissioner Dimas, what is rather strange in all this?"
"We have laid this down with overwhelming support here in Parliament and have spelt out where improvements could be made, but it has been blocked by the Council."
"The Council has now failed to do anything about this for two years."
"My question to you is whether there is still any chance of movement on this."
"You rightly report progress in connection with the pilot project and the aircraft that have been deployed, but about the underlying dossier Parliament has requested so emphatically we hear nothing at all."
"Is that still on the agenda?"
"What is actually happening?"
"With regard to the civil protection force, I would say that, in itself, it is great that Europe is deploying its own instruments, but that the broad foundations lie in the Member States themselves."
"The exchange of expertise, deployment particularly in the wider region itself, should constitute these foundations."
"Finally, the rehabilitation: damage repair, replanting and everything related to this."
"This is not a matter for centralised control, but must be decentralised to Member States."
"However, we also have these funds - the Structural Funds, the agricultural funds - so why do we not make a start?"
"It can be an economic plan, as we have just heard, but equally a rehabilitation plan that is tackled in a comprehensive way and in which the decentralised instruments play a particularly prominent role."
"That is what this resolution requests, and that is why we shall be supporting it wholeheartedly tomorrow."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as accurate as the resolution entitled 'Natural disasters', tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), is, I would nonetheless like to draw attention to some points that have been addressed this evening but which are not addressed in the resolution, and which are the subject of my proposed amendments."
"Last summer, as well as the fires, there were other disasters, the most recent of which occurred only last weekend in the south of Italy."
"I myself come from a region of Italy, Veneto, which was hit in June and July by landslides and whirlwinds, and I would mention, by way of example, Vallà di Riese and Borca di Cadore."
"In the resolution, we should mention the other natural disasters, too, not just the fires, because summer floods unfortunately are not a new phenomenon; this is one of the scenarios that we will have to face in future, as a consequence, sadly, of climate change due to global warming."
"We must therefore try to insist on prevention measures and on the construction of infrastructure that can prevent these events or at least contain the damage, or worse, when this infrastructure exacerbates them: I am thinking of reservoirs in mountain regions, green belt areas, rural and forest areas, and along watercourses."
"Secondly, since, in the majority of cases, natural disasters are also caused by human acts, it is important to ascertain who is responsible for them, to pursue the culprits and to increase the penalties."
"Lastly, I would like to say that it is a good idea to set up this independent intervention force and the associated Solidarity Fund."
"It is important, however, to try to extend the intervention to other disasters also, to increase the allocation for these disasters by pooling various funds, to simplify the procedures and to ensure greater coordination and flexibility, as Mr Mauro mentioned."
"Mr President, I was listening to this debate in my office."
"Obviously and thankfully, in Ireland we do not experience the severity of the fires that our southern European colleagues do."
"Two thoughts struck me."
"One is that in this House, we tend to speak only on those issues that directly affect our own countries and, given that we are having a debate in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty - where we are talking about solidarity across the European Union - I think it is a habit we should break."
"I think more of us should speak about issues of concern in other Member States that we know of, so that there is a sense in which there is greater solidarity among Members of this House regarding the concerns of their citizens."
"I would, for example, like other people to take up concerns that might arise in Ireland for my citizens."
"I think it would help us to promote the idea that Europe works for all and that we are not just looking after our own."
"That has been one of the failures of the European Union, and it is something we are grappling with in the debate on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Let me support what you are doing here and express my solidarity for the problems in southern Europe."
"Deal with those who deliberately destroy."
"Look at prevention."
"Much more must be done by management and, lastly, the Solidarity Funds should be released to those who need them."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, this is the first time I have been an MEP - I was elected on 7 June - but from the debate, it is clear that this matter comes back every September after the wave of devastating fires that particularly affect southern Europe: Italy, France, Greece and Spain."
"Mention has already been made of the devastating fire on the island of La Palma, in the outermost region of the Canaries, a Spanish autonomous community where I was born and where I live."
"What is important however, is that we are aware that, although it is particularly intense on the southern borders of Europe, here we have an opportunity to increase the affection and connection that citizens have with what Europe means: added value in terms of the response."
"This means European added value in prevention and European added value in the coordination of the institutions: the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament with the resolution, in cooperation with the Member States."
"However, there also needs to be European added value in the response."
"This is why it is important that we move from debate to action, by making the Solidarity Fund more flexible in response to emergencies, and that we start up this European civil protection force, which is still pending, and which is what could really make a difference in the future when we are faced with these emergencies, which recur every summer as a result of climate change and global warming."
"(PT) Mr President, more than all the demonstrations of solidarity in the face of this scourge of forest fires which ravage our southern countries, including Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, every year, we urgently need to adopt the necessary measures to reverse this situation, since it is destroying our remaining forests, properties, livestock, biodiversity and, worse still, a number of human lives."
"It is therefore time to tackle the causes of this scourge head on, and to take account of the serious, growing abandonment of rural areas."
"It is time to change the common agricultural policy so as to invest in prevention, which also means investing in multifunctional agriculture, including Mediterranean forestry, by supporting family farming and by providing the conditions for small and medium-sized farmers and young people to remain in rural areas and, in that way, contribute to the measures to prevent this yearly scourge."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied by the response that Commissioner Dimas was able to give on this issue and, in particular, by his speaking of the importance of aid beyond the borders of our continent."
"In addition to environmental protection of the Mediterranean Sea, might one formally propose, as part of the Union for the Mediterranean project, this emergency aid in the event of fire and the development of forestry expertise on this subject, to be shared and developed with the non-European countries of the Union for the Mediterranean?"
"(RO) This summer, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece were faced with major forest fires."
"In Greece, the fires devastated an area of approximately 21 200 hectares, destroying around 2 million trees and at least 150 houses."
"In a coordinated effort at European level, France, Spain and Cyprus sent Canadair planes to the Athens region to put out the fires."
"The EU's strategic backup for combating the forest fires proved, therefore, to be useful once again."
"The EU Solidarity Fund can also provide assistance in this kind of situation, bearing some of the costs of the emergency measures implemented in order to restore the infrastructure, provide temporary shelter and protect the natural heritage."
"I want to draw attention to the fact that we need to reduce the bureaucracy involved with accessing this fund."
"Let me give you a specific example from my own country."
"Romania was hit by natural disasters in June of last year."
"Currently, in September 2009, the funds have still not been distributed to the Romanian Government."
"I also believe that we need in the future a sustainable forestry policy, as well as a strategy for preventing disasters of this kind."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable members of Parliament for their extremely constructive contributions to this evening's debate and for the excellent ideas they have proposed."
"Emergencies often involve a high human, financial and environmental cost."
"In future, due to climate change, as many members emphasised, we shall probably have to deal with more and bigger disasters - not only forest fires, which will not be confined to southern Europe and will start to appear in central and even in northern Europe - and a different type of disaster, such as floods."
"We therefore need to constantly strengthen and improve European disaster management resources, which have now clearly proven their added value."
"This has also been confirmed by the fires this summer, which reminded us that the Community needs to improve not only its capacity to respond to natural disasters, but also its ability to prevent them, as numerous speakers emphasised this evening."
"I should remind the House here that in February, the Commission presented a communication on the prevention of natural and man-made disasters in which it formulated certain proposals."
"We are awaiting the European Parliament's and the Council's comments on this communication."
"I believe that the new Parliament will not delay its response, which we expect to receive in February."
"We believe that they will give us the political incentive, as will a resolution on this from the forthcoming conference, to proceed with the necessary work in this direction."
"As numerous speakers, starting with Mrs Podimata, raised the issue, I should also highlight the issue of climate change and the need for adaptation and the proposed review of the Community strategy on forests, the aim of which is to address climate-related aspects."
"This, too, will provide an opportunity to examine issues relating to forest fires."
"I should add here that this Commission communication is very important, as is the communication we issued last week on financing for the agreement on climate change which we expect to emerge from Copenhagen, with a large sum being made available for financing adaptation to climate change in developing countries."
"Funds will be directed to the works needed so that the countries which suffer the repercussions of climate change without having contributed to the greenhouse effect will be able to deal with those repercussions."
"In fact, I have proposed that we should not simply wait for 2013 to start this action, but should start it at once, in 2010."
"I hope that the European Council will agree, either on 17 September or in October, that money should be provided to start works immediately, so that these countries can see that the European Union and the developed countries really mean what they propose and what they say."
"A lot of other, very important points were made - and may I say that they were all right - about the role of Community financing."
"The Community mechanism for rural development and the European Regional Development Fund offer the facility to support national prevention measures."
"The Commission will use the facilities provided by the Community Solidarity Fund to support restoration efforts in the Member States."
"Having heard that intervention by the Commission should be immediate, I should clarify the following here: there are two issues and it was not clear which of the two was being referred to."
"One is mobilisation of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and the other is activation of the Solidarity Fund."
"As far as mobilisation of the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection is concerned, I can tell you that mobilisation is immediate, in real time."
"I would cite the recent example of the fires which broke out in Greece: within an hour of receiving an official request from the Greek Government, Italian aircraft had taken off in order to be on site ready for deployment the following day."
"Mobilisation is therefore immediate."
"As I said in my first speech, we were the first to send specialists to the scene of the disaster in the cases of the tsunami and hurricane Katrina."
"We received a great deal of praise for the action taken through the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and this confirms both the work achieved over recent years and the potential which it has, provided that it has the remit and the resources - especially the financial resources - to be able to extend its work for the benefit of the European Union, citizens, environmental protection and the property of European citizens."
"As far as the Solidarity Fund is concerned, I have heard - and it is right - that it needs greater flexibility."
"In fact, it needs to be able to react as quickly as possible, because the precise philosophy of the Solidarity Fund is to cover emergencies or part of the emergencies caused by disasters."
"It is therefore logical that the Commission should act immediately and that the Member States, through either their central or regional administrations, should take immediate action so that monies are disbursed."
"Moreover, there is also the clause in the European Solidarity Fund that works must be carried out within one year of disbursement."
"This is logical, but needs greater flexibility."
"To close - and I am sorry that I do not have more time to reply to the very specific issues raised - I should just like to say before I forget, because a number of speakers referred to the economic recovery programmes, that they are indeed a very good idea, because there are numerous benefits from including projects to prevent disasters which we can more or less expect to happen next year as well - as previously said, we discuss these matters every year - both because they will generate economic activity and create more jobs and because they will prevent damage costing millions of euros in restoration works."
"They are therefore investments which will have a multiple return and will, of course, prevent the human cost of disasters."
"Finally, I should like to point out that, while the risk of forest fires or other disasters, such as floods, earthquakes and even military intervention - because the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection has intervened for floods, earthquakes and forest fires and to move populations, such as after the conflict in Lebanon, and we have assisted here with great success - cannot be completely removed, it can nonetheless be reduced through our cooperation and a better collective response to such disasters."
"The Commission undertakes to strengthen the Community contribution to prevention, readiness, response and restoration of disasters, in order to protect citizens and the environment."
"May I thank Parliament once again for its active support for the need to improve disaster management for the benefit of all European citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 16 September."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I am quite concerned by the magnitude assumed by these disasters in recent years, which not only have natural but human causes as well, with consequences for both the economic and social infrastructure."
"Our response to this phenomenon through the European Union's Solidarity Fund provides important support in the task of rebuilding the areas affected by disasters, along with reducing their potential cross-border effects."
"However, I want to highlight the need to simplify and improve the transparency of the criteria for deploying this Fund so that the affected areas can benefit from Community support as quickly as possible."
"We must also allow more regions to receive assistance by introducing a lower deployment ceiling."
"Furthermore, I support the drawing up of a European strategy for combating natural disasters and for strengthening a joint European force ready to respond in the event of a disaster, in any corner of the EU."
"This summer, again, there were devastating forest fires in some areas of Europe that not only caused considerable economic damage, but also claimed 11 lives."
"Europe needs to show solidarity in the face of such natural disasters."
"Pressing situations of this nature give the Community the opportunity to demonstrate its qualities and enable Europe's population to experience direct added value on the part of the European Union."
"In practical implementation, however, the rules of subsidiarity absolutely must be complied with."
"It is the Member States who are responsible for precautionary preparations for disasters and for drawing up emergency management plans and the EU must not meddle in this important competence on the part of the individual Member States."
"The Community's Solidarity Fund is a sound and valuable financial management tool."
"In the long term, the strategy to prevent fires of this nature in Europe must be improved and we must end the reliance on short-term crisis management."
"In the face of the tragic fires that have once again devastated southern Europe, we must react in order to successfully put a stop to these intolerable events."
"Firstly, by organising the means of intervention better: it is Mr Barnier's idea to have a European civil protection force capable of intervening in support of the national forces."
"In order to contain a fire, large-scale, fast intervention is required: European solidarity has to be more effective."
"Prevention remains vitally important, however: forests must be maintained and cleared."
"In the south of France, 75% of the forest is privately owned."
"It is therefore important to enlist the support of the owners and to encourage them to maintain their wooded areas."
"In particular, this will mean regenerating the Mediterranean forest, the economic returns from which are too low: Structural Fund-supported initiatives must encourage the regular sampling of biomass and its use for energy purposes, and the development of sustainable forestry and responsible ecotourism."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to recognise the characteristics of the Mediterranean forest and to propose an action plan designed to protect it and to make better use of its natural resources."
"That is the very least that can be done to reduce the risks of fire in the long term, and to preserve and restore the fragile ecosystems of southern Europe."
"Free trade agreement with South Korea: impact on European industry (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the free trade agreement with South Korea: impact on European industry."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, a large potential for new exporting opportunities lies in the Asian markets that have high growth rates but also, of course, high barriers to entry."
"Apart from the multilateral talks, an important way to overcome these barriers is through the leverage available to us in free trade agreement negotiations."
"That is why Member States have asked the Commission to launch a new generation of trade agreements with key Asian economies."
"These free trade agreements should be ambitious in creating new exporting opportunities for many sectors."
"With Korea, this is what we have achieved after two intensive years of negotiations."
"This is the most ambitious free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union."
"There is consensus in that in two of the three main sectors of our economy, the benefits from the free trade agreement are overwhelmingly in our favour: first of all, our competitive service providers will gain massively from the agreement."
"For example, in areas such as telecoms, transport, construction and environmental services, doing business in Korea will be much easier in the future."
"Secondly, for agricultural products, Korea will eliminate almost all of its particularly high tariffs - they average 35%!"
"That will give a boost to farming exports of, amongst other things, pork, wine, whisky or dairy products."
"We will also secure the protection of European geographical indications, such as Parma ham, Rioja or Tokay."
"But the free trade agreement will also bring major benefits to European manufacturing exporters."
"Overall, European manufacturing exporters will save some EUR 1.2 billion of tariffs annually, of which EUR 800 million are saved on day one."
"For example, exporters of machineries would save EUR 450 million annually on annual duty payments while exporters of chemicals would save over EUR 150 million on duties."
"Duty elimination will also allow our exporters to strengthen their foothold in the Korean market, and thus expand sales."
"Korean customers buy some EUR 25 billion worth of EU goods every year. This makes Korea one of our most important export markets in Asia."
"In addition, there was a special focus on rules."
"The agreement includes transparency on regulation, efficient enforcement of commitments, better protection of intellectual property rights and 'WTO-plus' rules on subsidies which will all be to the benefit of all manufacturers selling in Korea."
"Moreover, ambitious disciplines have been established on industrial technical barriers to trade, notably for cars, electronics and pharmaceuticals based on the regulatory model of Europe and they respond to longstanding demands by European business in these sectors."
"Korea will need to changes its domestic regulations to comply with these commitments, whereas no such change would be needed in Europe."
"Concerning the car industry specifically, I want to signal first of all that we also have an interest in enhancing market access for European cars in Korea."
"Our car exporters are by far the strongest importers on the Korean market, with strong growth rates."
"They can develop this further since they will benefit from the combination of elimination of tariffs - EUR 2 000 saved on a car worth EUR 25 000 - and the removal of technical obstacles."
"The agreement negotiated includes the most ambitious disciplines for non-tariff barriers ever negotiated with a third country."
"Korea will accept from day one that a car that conforms to international standards will be considered as complying with those Korean regulations that have been signalled by our industry as representing significant obstacles."
"There are also provisions by which Korea accepts the equivalence between European and Korean environmental regulations."
"Indeed, even before the agreement enters into force, Korea has agreed to apply certain transitional derogations from the Korean environmental standards important for our exporters and we are monitoring very closely discussions in Korea about new regulations to limit CO2 emissions in order to make them show that they are not an impediment to trade."
"We are aware of the sensitivities of the car sector."
"We defended long transition periods for the liberalisation of our most sensitive car segment, namely small cars."
"Tariffs will only be eliminated in year five of the agreement, and that allows time for adjustment."
"We should remember the significant Korean investment in the car sector in Europe."
"Moderately, we have changed the rules of origin by increasing the permissible limit of foreign value in Korean cars from 40% to 45%, and we agreed a bilateral safeguard clause which lets us put up tariffs in case of a surge of imports and a threat of injury to our industries."
"On duty drawback, my final point, this is nothing new."
"Such policies are legitimate under the World Trade Organisation."
"Duty drawback also does not create a significant competitive disadvantage for our car producers since our tariffs on car parts are generally very low and will be further reduced."
"And we have negotiated a special clause that would enable us to limit duty drawback efficiently."
"I underline the strength of support from European manufacturing sectors, as well as agriculture and service organisations, for this agreement."
"This is important, and it is a clear signal of our determination to pursue market access interest in key emerging Asian economies."
"Mr President, South Korea is the EU's fourth largest external trading partner, with an export volume of around EUR 30 billion a year."
"Concluding the free trade agreement is thus very much in the interests of European employers and European workers."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, I have no intention of congratulating you today, as the agreement has not yet been signed, but if you really do manage, in these times of crisis - at a time when export rates around the world have fallen apart as never before in history - to wrap up the free trade agreement, that would be a tremendous achievement which, from the bottom of my heart, I hope you could achieve."
"Trade agreements are often highly controversial, but personally I would say that South Korea is a very worthy exception."
"I hear very positive feedback from nearly every area of European industry."
"I am thinking of mechanical engineering, pharmaceuticals, electrical engineering, chemicals and numerous service industries."
"I have never before come across an example where positive feedback about trade negotiations has been forthcoming from the agricultural sector."
"That is certainly a novelty - something that I think virtually none of us have encountered before."
"The results are clearly positive, even if many sectors would have liked more to have been achieved."
"There is one exception, though, namely vehicle construction."
"Even here, however, it is not the whole industry but just a few manufacturers who are critical of the agreement."
"Other manufacturers, and many suppliers in particular, are very positively disposed towards the agreement in its current form."
"I think it would be good if we were to seize the opportunity to tackle some of the points of criticism in this industry and perhaps still iron out some of the detrimental consequences of the free trade agreement through details here or there."
"I am thinking, in this regard, of key areas such as the Capital Region Act Seoul, of standards for on-board diagnostics, of environmental standards, the duty drawback protection clause, etc. We should avoid misunderstandings here or, better still, clear them up completely and, above all, press the South Koreans so that the undertakings that they have given us really are realised."
"Clear monitoring of potential new non-tariff barriers to trade would certainly make sense."
"I hope that the agreement enters into force very soon and that the consumers and workers of the European Union are able to benefit from it very quickly."
"Thank you very much, and I wish you much continued success in the home straight."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to hear a conservative and a liberal fellow Member agree with the Commission; it makes my job as a socialist easier."
"I hope, in any case, that this evening's debate will make it possible at last to address the many concerns regarding the impact of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea and, in particular, on European industry."
"You spoke of a consensus but, Commissioner, I would remind you that, for some months now, certain industrial sectors - including car manufacturers and workers' unions, which support them - have been warning you of the possible tragic consequences of this agreement."
"Today, the bulk of these issues have still not been addressed."
"It may be the case, however, that you have chosen to sacrifice the European car industry for the benefit of services."
"Indeed, why allow Korea to have duty drawback, which is a benefit that has never been granted before, not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean?"
"What is the logic behind flexible rules of origin, the impact of which is to be feared, not only for the car industry, but also for the European textile industry?"
"Why allow such distortions of competition and, above all, why set this precedent?"
"In the face of these risks, and, unfortunately, of others, which I cannot expand on here but the details of which you know - you have just mentioned them - the Commission has proposed a last resort, the inclusion of a safeguard clause."
"However, you know, Commissioner, that the safeguard clause is not automatic and that it will be very difficult to implement and impossible to activate for five years."
"I will cite just one example to illustrate our fears."
"If the free trade agreement allows Korea to export 100 000 additional vehicles to Europe - it already exports 600 000 of them annually - 6 000 jobs will be lost."
"Conversely, Europe is terribly restricted, with each manufacturer being able to export just 1 000 vehicles to Korea, as part of a total European quota of 6 000 vehicles."
"At this time of crisis, which is having a particular effect on car workers, how do you explain Europe's committing itself to such an agreement?"
"Do you envisage a renegotiation of the controversial points that I have just mentioned?"
"This is what a number of Member States and industrial sectors that I have just mentioned are calling for, anyway."
"Will you commit yourself at last, Commissioner, to ensuring greater transparency and to involving us MEPs to a greater extent?"
"We, and the Commission, created the conditions for a negative image of the Polish plumber; let us not create a negative image of the Korean coach builder."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank you, Commissioner Ashton, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for the information that you have given us this evening in the extraordinary committee meeting and here in plenary."
"Clearly, the free trade agreement with South Korea is close to being concluded."
"From a Liberal viewpoint, and particularly from the point of view of my own German Free Democratic Party, the objective of free and fair world trade is of great importance, particularly right now, as, in the course of the economic and financial crisis, we see tendencies towards protectionism, tendencies which must be resolutely countered in the interests of prosperity and jobs in the European Union."
"In this context, the question arises of what significance the Commission attaches to the free trade agreement with South Korea, as there has, for a long time, been a focus on progress in the Doha development round, without any agreement being reached so far."
"That is the reason behind my question, Commissioner Ashton: do you see concluding the free trade agreement with South Korea as a first step towards further bilateral free trade agreements, and does that, in your view, mean a move away from Doha?"
"Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union's free trade policy?"
"As you know, furthermore, the clause on the refunding of duties is a cause of concern in a number of Member States and sectors of industry - in particular, in the car industry."
"This clause could lead to supporting business in low-cost countries such as India and China, thereby threatening European manufacturing."
"Can you see a way that these concerns on the part of a number of Member States in respect of such refunding of duties can still be addressed?"
"The Commissioner's statement makes it clear that there are economic and financial groups and sectors in the European Union that are going to gain from this agreement with South Korea."
"There is also the other side of the coin, however, which you have not considered here, Commissioner."
"I refer specifically to certain more sensitive sectors, such as textiles and clothing, and worker's jobs."
"Therefore, as they concern industries and workers' organisations in our countries, it is worrying that the European Commission continues to ignore the serious difficulties facing the textile and clothing industries."
"I must highlight the situation in my country, Portugal, where unemployment has reached alarming levels, precisely in the regions where these industries predominate: in the north and certain parts of central Portugal."
"That is why we stress the need for a consistent, concerted strategy to support industry in the European Union, particularly those sectors that depend on intensive labour, whether through urgent regulation of world markets or by means of public policies that support investment, innovation, differentiation, vocational training and the creation of jobs with rights."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, this is my first, or maiden, speech in this Parliament."
"As a UKIP MEP for the East of England, you will expect me to be a rebel and I will try not to disappoint you or my voters."
"We are discussing today EU trade agreements and, in particular, that with South Korea, due to be signed this year."
"As we do not have much of the detail on this particular agreement, other than the fact, I believe, that two thirds of the benefits will accrue to South Korea and one third to the EU, I would like to make some more general points."
"Many people are not aware that there are over a hundred separate bilateral EU trade agreements like this one; 116 is one estimate."
"There are trade agreements with countries such as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Japan and South Africa."
"In Europe, there are trade agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and Liechtenstein."
"There are also trade agreements with non-EU EEA and EFTA countries such as Switzerland and Norway."
"Norway's trade agreement religiously protects both its fishing and farming, and Norway is not a minnow."
"It is the EU's fourth largest import partner and sixth largest export market."
"What should a trade agreement like South Korea's really contain, then?"
"Switzerland, I believe, is a strong example."
"There are provisions abolishing customs duties and trade quotas on industrial and agricultural products."
"There are provisions to allow Swiss citizens the right to live and work in EU countries and for EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland."
"There are provisions for Switzerland to be part of the Schengen passport-free area."
"The Swiss can be in the European Environment Agency, if they wish, in the EU's film and education programmes, and they can apply for EU research grants."
"There is cooperation on airlines, asylum and judicial matters."
"In short, they have all the claimed benefits of EU membership, but without the cost."
"It is true that Switzerland must pay CHF 600 million per year for access, but the Swiss Government reports savings for not being a member of the EU amounting to CHF 3.4 billion, a net saving of CHF 2.8 billion a year."
"Nor is Switzerland an insignificant trading partner either: 80% of Swiss exports go to the EU, and it is the EU's fourth largest trading partner."
"My point is that trade agreements can achieve the benefits of EU trade without the burden of high regulatory costs, loss of sovereignty and of resources."
"Even the Commission website admits 'Switzerland can develop and retain its own regulations in other areas which deviate from EU rulings."
"It is in its own interests, such as in financial and in labour markets.'"
"How Britain would love to deviate in a similar way over the Working Time Directive, Temporary Workers' Directive or the new Fund Managers' Directive!"
"So I conclude in asking, why not Britain?"
"Why cannot Britain have a similar, friendly trade agreement with the EU like South Korea instead of full EU membership?"
"Britain on its own is the largest single trading partner with the EU with a GBP 40 billion deficit a year."
"We, too, can have the kind of assurances the Swiss enjoy."
"We could, and I believe we should, be an independent free trading nation once again such as Norway, Switzerland and even South Korea."
"Mr President, as one of the rapporteurs on the FTA with South Korea and a strong FTA protagonist, I am hoping for a balanced and level-playing-field agreement that benefits both sides - a true win-win situation."
"One of our core industries is not really happy with the current status of negotiations, and they have many friends in their camp, including some Member States, industries and MEPs."
"They all see the playing field unfairly tilted to benefit South Korea in this agreement."
"The European Commission and the European Council should look hard into areas of friction, namely the DDB safeguard clause, non-tariff barriers and rules of origin."
"If some progress could be achieved to bring more satisfaction to the EU car industry, then employment levels, strong GDP and expected standards of living would really benefit and be preserved."
"However, a level playing field will not be a disadvantage."
"A strong precedent may be established for other FTAs waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future."
"It is clear to me that this agreement overall brings other benefits to the EU and to some of the EU's different industries."
"In the small picture, there will always be some winners and losers: it is the nature of any bilateral agreement."
"In the big picture, we could be close to real balance."
"However, with such a crucial industry as the automobile industry in a fairly unhappy mode, there is a need to try for more."
"Only when achieving some additional progress can we speak of a truly balanced FTA that is acceptable and has a real and positive impact as a precedent for future FTAs."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have welcomed the work done during this period in which Mrs Ashton has been carrying out her role as Commissioner."
"I must say that we have had a better relationship with her than we had with her predecessor, despite their common political affiliation, which we too share, and their common nationality."
"However, this time I do not share the Commissioner's enthusiasm on this issue, because too often in recent years, the Commission has taken the floor here and talked up certain initiatives, only to then pursue a different path."
"We are going through a particular moment in time, a major economic and financial crisis, which is also the result of a lack of reciprocity in the world, not only with developing countries - which has its own logic, its own explanation - but with the new global players and the traditional global players."
"Too often I seem to sense a lack of awareness within the Commission, by its President and its Commissioners, of which initiatives should be implemented to aid the recovery of European industry, the recovery of the European manufacturing industry."
"It seems to me that this agreement - which, admittedly, is a positive agreement and has extremely positive content - has more of an academic value; it is almost a textbook treaty, but one that is not in touch with reality."
"We export USD 30 billion to Korea, only USD 20 billion come back in the form of cars exported from Korea to Europe, and USD 1.5 billion will be the indirect aid that accrues to Korean cars in Europe, without mentioning the textile and other sectors."
"That is a definite imbalance, which I believe must be highlighted and must be corrected, before the green light is given to a free trade agreement that penalises European industry."
"Ours is a quality industry that has committed itself to the new requirements that innovation calls for, certainly not a bankrupt industry that cannot get to grips with the need for innovation that exists within the economy."
"(CS) Mr President, Commissioner, I too am not happy about the curious changes to the agreement, such as refunds of customs charges on imported components in the case of products for export to the Union and a reduction in the 60% threshold for determining the country of origin."
"This amounts to favouring Korean imports at the expense of the competitiveness of European industry and at the expense of unemployment."
"The lion's share in this respect already goes to imported goods from Asia, where labour costs are uncompetitively low, due to poor or non-existent social and environmental standards."
"The trade talks should therefore have focused on raising these standards, rather than on the prosperity of Asian industry at the expense of Europe."
"The Commission has long owed this to the citizens of Europe."
"Does the Commission have any awareness of the negative impact of the agreement on European competitiveness and on employment in the automobile and textile industries?"
"Secondly, is it aware that the agreement sets an unfortunate precedent for future trade agreements?"
"Thirdly, does the Commission intend to ignore the fundamental objections raised by European engineering unions?"
"Fourthly, how is it that the Korean media are already celebrating a victory for their automobile industry when the agreement has not even been discussed by the College of the Commission?"
"Or is the Commission prepared to revise the draft and to negotiate a balanced agreement?"
"Does the Commission have the will to put pressure on Korea to adopt international obligations in respect of social and environmental standards and will it do so before Korea gains all of the benefits of free trade with the European Union?"
"Thank you for your answer."
"I trust that common sense will prevail."
"Mr President, I must say I am rather concerned about the tone of this debate."
"With the exception, perhaps, of Daniel Caspary's contribution, it has been rather negative."
"I was Parliament's rapporteur on the Korean Free Trade Agreement."
"In advance of this debate, I looked back on what we had decided to ask for - what we asked the Commission to go into in these negotiations and achieve on our behalf - and I actually think the Commission has achieved what we asked them to achieve."
"I would like to pay tribute to the chief negotiator, who I see sitting next to Baroness Ashton, and to Baroness Ashton herself, for the way they have delivered this agreement."
"Clearly, in any free trade agreement - by definition - and in any negotiation, there are winners and losers, but if you look at the global impact of this agreement, there are big winners in Europe and there are big winners in Korea."
"Therefore, there are big winners in keeping world trade moving."
"At this current time, in this present crisis, anything that sends a positive signal about two units as big as Korea and as big as the European Union that we want to keep trade moving and we want to keep trade open has to be a good thing."
"I have to say that, if the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers cannot move this agreement to a final signed agreement between Korea and the EU, we might as well send a note to DG Trade to stop negotiating all other free trade agreements because, if we do not deliver on Korea, forget ASEAN, forget the Gulf States, forget the whole other raft of FTAs we are trying to negotiate, and, frankly, forget Doha."
"This is an important agreement, where Europe has achieved its strategic objectives."
"Let us send a positive signal to the rest of the world that Europe is open for business and that, in the teeth of this recession, we are keen to keep our markets as open as possible."
"Mr President, just very briefly, this is all new to me and I found the discussion very stimulating and educational."
"When Lady Ashton first spoke, I thought this was a fantastic deal for the European Union and I wondered if there were any benefits in it for Korea."
"Then speaker after speaker gave the opposite view, so I hope that the questions put and the points made by Mr Arif, Mr Theurer, Mr Campbell Bannerman and other speakers could be answered specifically by Lady Ashton when she replies and also she might tell us if there are any other negotiations going on right now with specific Asian countries for bilateral agreements and also how far they have progressed."
"Mr President, I would like to speak in support of the contention made by my colleague, Mr Campbell Bannerman."
"In 2006, the Swiss Federal Government commissioned a report on all aspects of existing and possible relationships with the European Union."
"They concluded that full membership of the EU would cost them up to six times their current bilateral arrangements."
"The Swiss being the Swiss decided that they were better off by not joining or achieving full EU membership."
"If that is true for the Swiss, it is certainly true for the British, and, if only our Government had as sensible and pragmatic a view of Britain's economy as the Swiss have of Switzerland's, then we would leave, just as the Swiss would not join."
"Mr President, you are a very tolerant chair, but it is very clear in our rules that interventions under the 'catch the eye' procedure have to relate to the subject under discussion."
"That was nothing to do with Korea, and it was nothing to do with free trade agreements."
"(FI) Mr President, in his speech just now, Mr Martin said that it is extremely important to conclude agreements that will speed up economic growth and employment and remove trade barriers generally, especially in this economic crisis."
"We have to remember, however, that today we have also just had a very serious discussion about the crisis in Europe's car industry, and this week we will also be dealing with problems in the textile industry and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund aid as compensation for the massive layoffs in that sector in Spain and Portugal."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, we have to take seriously the concern of Europeans regarding how we respond to this loss of jobs in Europe and examine what the Commission's cures actually are."
"Although free trade must be good for employment and economic growth at a general level, how do we prevent the loss of jobs in these traditional European industries?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to say that the debate did not, in a sense, at all surprise me, because the concerns that colleagues have raised have indeed been raised over the months."
"I want to pay tribute to David Martin, just to begin with, for the work that he has done in the committee."
"It is very important that I recognise how much the Committee on International Trade has worked with me over the months that have proceeded it, and of course I am very well aware that colleagues have not had the benefit of seeing the detail of the agreement so far."
"So I will try and address the concerns."
"But, more importantly, we will make sure that we give you more and more detail, because it is important that you look at the facts rather than the assertions that will have been made."
"Let me just make some general points about the approach on this deal first."
"This deal was put in play in order to achieve the best for European industry - including, I would say to colleagues from the UKIP, British industry."
"It is absolutely in the interests of Europe, in my view, to move forward with this deal - otherwise I would not be standing here suggesting that we move forward in the way that I have."
"Now, in doing so, there was a clear modus operandi, a clear approach that the Commission took which, as has been said, was supported by Parliament, by the Commission and by the Council, and that is indeed the way we have gone forward."
"My colleague, Mr Arif, will not mind, I think, if I say that to suggest that I would sacrifice any industry, I find alarming or perhaps a little depressing, because that is certainly not the approach that I would take."
"Do I think that if you want a serious trade deal you have to recognise that actually it is a deal where both sides benefit?"
"Yes, I do."
"If you want to have trade agreements, if we do believe - which I think we do - that trade is the engine that will take us out of recession, then it means you have serious, tough negotiations with industries and with countries that we care about having a deal with. Otherwise, we can just do deals all day long with countries we do not much care about, and we can open markets because we are not really interested."
"Korea is a serious market. It provides real opportunities for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, other industries."
"We need to recognise the value and importance of doing this if we want serious trade agreements."
"We are, in fact, an economic superpower."
"I could not disagree more with my colleagues from the United Kingdom when they talk about Switzerland and try and equate that, somehow, with the relationship that we are trying to form in Europe with Korea - or maybe I just missed the point."
"This is about serious negotiations to get a serious outcome and, as the details of this unfold, I hope that colleagues will look at it in the spirit that we have tried to set it up."
"The car industry gave us at the beginning a list of things that they wished us to achieve."
"They were genuinely very concerned to keep the market in Korea open, and we have achieved all that they asked at the beginning."
"The textile industry: I am confident that there is little to worry about."
"The textile industry safeguards that we have will indeed make sure that we retain European jobs."
"I am not interested in closing down jobs or industries in Europe at all, and this deal does not do that."
"And those of you who think that you have evidence to prove it, I ask you to supply it to me, because the rhetoric is one thing, the reality is a different thing, and we really have got to get beyond the rhetoric and into the reality of what this deal provides."
"Indeed, I would argue that what we have got before us is very important for all the industrial sectors."
"The question about duty drawback is, for me, a very simple one."
"Duty drawback is designed so that our response to it will prevent a particular problem."
"The question is, is it the only way of solving a problem?"
"If there are other ways that equally solve the problem but, in fact, invite us to get a better trade agreement, then I will explore them."
"But I still want to solve the same problem, and I believe the mechanisms we have in place in this agreement do precisely that."
"It is not some thing that we hold up as being for ever enshrined as the only way of achieving what we want to achieve - to prevent, effectively, imports via the back door - and I believe we have resolved the problem in a different way."
"So I am not going to make apologies - politically, economically or in any other way - to Parliament for having gone out and invested in negotiating this important trade deal."
"I make no apology for that, and I make no apology for putting forward to this Parliament what I believe is a serious, 21st century free trade agreement of enormous benefit across the economy of the European Union."
"I especially make no apology for doing it at a time of economic crisis because, if ever there was a time when my responsibility was to provide as much support for the businesses and the workers of Europe, I believe that time is now, and that is what this deal does."
"I do urge colleagues, as I said earlier on, to look at the reality of the deal."
"You will be lobbied - I have been lobbied - but actually, when you look at what we have achieved, I believe it is a very concrete result that will hugely benefit the economy of Europe."
"That, in the end, is what we set out to do, and that, in the end, is what we have achieved."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and South Korea, which should be concluded by mid-October, raises a number of concerns among European industries."
"Regarded by the European Trade Commissioner as the most ambitious ever negotiated by the EU, this agreement seemed to car manufacturers, in particular, to be very unbalanced."
"These manufacturers fear a massive influx of Korean vehicles on the European market as a consequence of the tariff preferences granted by the European Commission."
"There is no doubt that maintaining certain customs clauses such as duty drawback would be unfair and would create a distortion of competition that would be very harmful to the European car industry."
"This is all the more true given that the European Union's generosity does not seem to have been paid back with a lowering of the non-tariff barriers put up by the Korean authorities (import quotas on European petrol engine vehicles)."
"The Commission therefore has a duty, from today, to review the terms of this agreement so as to restore the conditions of fair and equitable competition and to ensure the long-term survival of our industry and our jobs in Europe."
"The effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission - B7-0209/2009) by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the effects of the global financial and economic crisis on developing countries and on development cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, while I have the pleasure of putting this oral question to you on behalf of the Committee on Development, sadly I do not have the pleasure of presenting you with the resolution on the same subject, adopted unanimously by this committee."
"My colleagues from the Committee on Development and I worked tirelessly to ensure that the resolution was voted on and debated in plenary before the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh."
"However, apart from my group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, no other political group supported our request to put this resolution on the agenda, and yet it is vital if we want the European Parliament to play more of a part in defining the European Union's external policy and to have real strength behind its proposals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, of what benefit will it be to us to vote on this resolution, which was to put the European Parliament's requests and proposals to the members of the G20 and, more specifically, to those of our Member States who sit on it, as well as to the European Commission, at the October plenary session, that is, after the Pittsburgh Summit?"
"Besides the fact that this devalues the work accomplished, we cannot be content with this role of current affairs commentator either."
"That is not our job."
"Let us leave it to those whose job it is and who do it with professionalism: journalists."
"Developing countries need us now more than ever."
"While our fellow citizens have not been spared, the global economic and financial crisis has had a far more lasting effect on the populations of developing countries."
"However, the financial institutions have not made these populations the main beneficiaries of the emergency loans, since very few of them satisfy the required conditions."
"The countries of Africa have thus received only 1.6% of the loans granted by the IMF since the last G20 meeting in London and the increase in the IMF's resources."
"The rest has gone to developed countries, European ones in particular."
"Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility."
"Public development aid must be increased as a matter of urgency."
"Already, most of the Member States do not meet the conditions required by the OECD since 1970, and we are facing new emergencies without having new funds."
"We must therefore find new sources of funding, not least by reforming the current system."
"The Committee on Development is asking you to take action to eradicate tax haven abuses, tax evasion and the illegal flows of capital from developing countries."
"According to a Norwegian report published in June, the figures of which have been verified, the illegal flows leaving developing countries are ten times the amount of our development aid."
"This shows just how much is at stake."
"There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay, on a country by country basis, in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate."
"Moreover, a radical reform of the system must take place involving, in particular, the introduction of new democratic and transparent regulations for trade and the international financial systems."
"The responsibilities are huge, the challenges many, and the task arduous, but, now more than ever, the European Union must step up to the plate and lead these reforms."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission in its role as the EU's representative in the G20, together with the Presidency, strongly advocates increased support to low-income countries, particularly the poorest, as one of the critical priorities of the G20 commitments."
"In this regard, it is important that low income countries receive appropriate funding to meet the needs emerging especially from the backlash of the financial crisis."
"That is why we advocate the need to enhance access by poor and fragile countries, often without institutional administrative capacities, to the facilities and credits made available by the international financial institutions and other donors."
"Personally, I will defend this approach at the November Development Affairs Council, and the global financial crisis will be at the centre of my political concerns during the weeks ahead."
"I hope I can count on your support throughout."
"In this context our 'Vulnerability FLEX' instrument is of particular relevance."
"The Commission has worked with the World Bank and the IMF to identify the most crisis-vulnerable countries and to complement the loan-based assistance provided by these two institutions with timely and targeted grant aid under the Vulnerability FLEX."
"Between 2009 and 2010, up to EUR 500 million will be spent on those ACP countries requesting assistance to ensure priority public spending, including in the social sectors."
"Let me reassure you that the frontloading of budget support through the Vulnerability FLEX mechanism will not lead to a funding gap insofar as the Commission is using non-earmarked reserves."
"Countries not eligible under the Vulnerability FLEX will also benefit from other measures proposed by the Commission in its April communication, for example, reallocations following ad hoc country reviews and the advanced mid-term review, support under the traditional FLEX, frontloading where feasible, etc."
"Concerning the targeting of the budget support, I am convinced that the flexibility inherent in this instrument already allows recipient countries to use the funds in the manner which they judge will best help them respond to economic and social problems."
"In addition, the advanced mid-term review of the 10th EDF will provide a good opportunity to identify new needs and assess whether these would be better addressed through general or sectoral budget support."
"The advanced medium-term review will also provide an additional opportunity to look again at budget support profiles in each ACP country and consider amendments, reallocation or additional funds from the reserve."
"Concerning the reform of the Bretton Woods institutions, our role in promoting their reform is, of course, limited."
"The issue of voice and representation will be discussed at the IMF World Bank annual meetings in Istanbul, which Commissioner Almunia and I will attend this October."
"In this respect, we welcome the addition of a third seat for sub-Saharan African countries on the World Bank's Board of Governors, and are looking with interest at proposals on the table for further reforms."
"Concerning illicit financial flows, I would like to reassure Mrs Joly that I have already given instructions to the Commission services to explore ways of improving fiscal and financial governance in developing countries in order to curb illicit financial flows."
"This crisis has also shown that we have to strengthen the mechanisms for delivering ODA."
"The international aid effectiveness agenda embodied in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action is now more important than ever."
"In these difficult economic times, we have a particular responsibility towards the world's poor to make sure our development assistance is being channelled effectively."
"In its 8 April communication, the Commission also underlined the useful contribution of innovative funding mechanisms as a complementary and mutually reinforcing instrument with ODA."
"We have urged Member States to use their full tool kit and to leverage non-ODA with ODA, for example, by building on ongoing voluntary solidarity levies such as the airline ticket taxes to finance health programmes."
"There will be high-level discussions on this subject, including a major conference in 2010 organised by the French, which will involve the Commission upstream."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it was exactly a year ago today that we witnessed the collapse of the financial institution Lehman Brothers."
"Then, according to the experts, we were on the verge of a financial collapse, and we were on the threshold of another great depression."
"The financial crisis intensified and extended to the real economy, and we have lived through a period in which we have had negative economic growth and job losses."
"However, developed countries are beginning to come out of the crisis."
"France and Germany have done so, for example, and the Commission presented its economic forecasts today, which show that in the second half of the year, the European Union will come out of the recession."
"However, the less developed countries are in the midst of the crisis and will continue to be there for a long time."
"They did not cause the crisis, but they are suffering the consequences of it more than anyone."
"They are suffering the consequences with less growth, faster growing unemployment, less direct investment, less foreign credit, less money sent back by emigrants, less official development aid and, of course, more trade restrictions."
"We have lived through a period during which our stability has declined and our comfortable situation has declined in a limited time, but they are in danger of losing a decade in the fight against poverty, and a decade means that an entire generation is lost."
"We can do a great deal for them on many aspects, and I would like to specifically focus on confronting protectionism."
"Last week, the Commission presented its fourth report on trade restriction measures, which shows that many countries are adopting new restrictive measures, which is disastrous for developing countries."
"Also, many developed countries will not fulfil their commitments to official development aid at the very time when we need fresh resources more than ever to confront the seriousness of the crisis."
"I therefore propose that we increase the coordination of this development aid with a broader agreement between donor countries, financial institutions and partners, and manage it more efficiently and transparently so that it does not generate costs and is not a bureaucratic burden."
"I urge the Commission, I urge the Commissioner, to implement the plan that it has presented to us, which I am sure Commissioner Almunia will agree with."
"Mr President, Mr De Gucht, Mrs Joly, I am, of course, very aware that, in this type of debate, we will inevitably hear a series of speeches all saying the same thing."
"That does not bother me, however."
"I believe that it is important to repeat again and again this strong consensus that the European Parliament has a duty to build and, moreover, this needs to be done along with the Commission."
"This is because, despite having claimed that developing countries would be scarcely affected by the financial crisis, all the experts are in agreement today that, on the contrary, the effects of this crisis will be disastrous for most developing countries."
"All the social sectors of poor countries are going to find themselves faced with a sharp rise in social needs, in particular, and in needs for services, and with a very significant fall in growth."
"Moreover, from this perspective, I very much appreciated your alluding, Commissioner, to the importance of responding to these needs in a far more flexible way, and I think that you know that, where it was possible to be so - obviously in the context of sufficient monitoring - I have always been a great supporter of State aid and direct aid, whether direct or sectoral aid, but of budgetary aid, in any case."
"I believe that there is an appropriation effect and another, far greater effect, to do with respect, and that gives the Member States powers."
"In spite of all that, I note that the G20 has not tackled the reform of the international financial institutions - I am referring to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - in order to give greater weight to the interests of the poor countries of the South."
"As Mrs Joly said, 80% of the recent loans from the IMF went to European countries and only 1.6% of these new loans were granted, for example, to African countries."
"The resources pledged to developing countries in the G20 package will not be enough - we know this too - and will not be sufficiently focused on the weakest countries."
"Worse still, these resources will not arrive quickly enough."
"The real challenge, as you have obviously realised, Commissioner, will be to force the Member States to honour their 2005 commitments."
"Nothing justifies a reduction in public development aid."
"However, as has already been said, several European countries have announced drastic cuts."
"I am thinking of Ireland (-10%), Italy (-50%) and Latvia (-100%)."
"This attitude is clearly totally unacceptable."
"Moreover, it is irresponsible."
"I should like to hear your opinion on a whole series of points."
"I heard your positive reaction regarding the vulnerability fund that the World Bank is proposing to create."
"You also responded in favour of combating tax havens."
"The countries of the South lose USD 1 000 billion each year in funds transferred illegally to the North, USD 350 billion of which pass through tax havens."
"The issue of international governance has already been discussed."
"Another issue that I believe should be highlighted is, of course, trade-related assistance."
"I am an enthusiastic supporter - unlike some, I know - of economic partnership agreements, provided, of course, that the specific situation is taken into account and transitional periods are introduced and, above all, provided that the Member States honour their commitment to provide this infamous EUR 1 billion sum each year to help trade."
"To my mind, this is obviously important, as others have said."
"What is needed today is to denounce the dual messages from certain Member States that talk in glowing terms about developing countries and make huge promises but which, at the same time, are cynically reducing their public development aid."
"Mr President, the question tabled by Mrs Joly on behalf of the Committee on Development brings up the issue of what we, as development policy makers, are actually trying to achieve in this debate."
"The promises of the last G8 and G20 summits ultimately never made it off the page."
"They are amongst the promises that are trotted out again and again but that have never led to adequate, tangible assistance."
"In this regard, I really cannot comprehend why we are not debating Parliament's resolution before Pittsburgh in order to apply appropriate political pressure."
"In light of the Commissioner's accurate analyses and of Mr Michel's observations, it seems clear to me that we know what is at hand here."
"Yet we are not in a position to apply political pressure in order to force the Member States to finally move away from this policy of 'charity begins at home'."
"Looking forward to Pittsburgh, that would seem to me to be the big danger."
"If we do not succeed in applying pressure and making it clear that we need new institutions specifically in order to support the poorest countries in the world, then we will still be sitting here after Pittsburgh pointing out that, ultimately, nothing has changed."
"That is also my request to you, Commissioner."
"I ask you, here in Parliament right now, to comment again specifically on the results and to tell us what can actually be demanded with the support of which Member States and to what extent we have actually made progress here."
"What we need is rapid and effective action because people are dying before our very eyes and they are doing so as a result of circumstances that we have helped bring about."
"I call on us all to act together!"
"Mr President, emergency fund contributions, as you know, recorded a decrease of EUR 4.8 billion in the amount intended for the regulation of humanitarian crises in the poorest countries."
"This is the highest recorded historical gap between the funds needed and the funds collected from donor governments and, seeing these figures, we cannot help but think about the huge amount of money spent on bank bailouts."
"Each government is responsible for solving its own country's problems but, at the same time, it is unfair and indecent to overlook the fact that the developing countries are hardest hit by the economic crisis, even though these countries are less responsible for that crisis."
"The world around us teaches us not to expect too much from humanitarian appeals, especially during periods of recession."
"I would therefore like to draw your attention to the risk of neglecting the developing countries and of accelerating the growth in poverty and obtaining a boomerang effect in the shape of increased internal tension, bloody conflicts, humanitarian tragedies and massive migration, yet again debated by developed countries."
"Considering these circumstances, I believe that efforts are required in one direction to assume our responsibilities."
"This requires boosting international aid and the need for more efficient development aid."
"I also believe we should focus on decreasing dependence on humanitarian aid for some of the beneficiaries."
"I would also like to ask the Commissioner - taking into account what former Commissioner Michel previously said about the need to step up the involvement of the World Bank and the IMF - whether he intends to come up with a proposal for this Istanbul Summit."
"I do not want to close this speech without stating my appreciation for the start of your Commission mandate."
"I have in mind the US-South Africa Summit, your visit to Zimbabwe at the end of this week, and the emergency assistance provided in recent days for the 100 000 victims of the floods in West Africa."
"At the same time, I wish to point out that not only Burkina Faso faces natural disasters, but Niger also needs international support."
"Human lives are not just threatened by floods, but also by the insidious and permanent threat of drought."
"I also appreciate that you allocated EUR 53 million last week to respond to the drought in sub-Saharan countries."
"These are encouraging indicators which I hope will influence the talks at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh and the Copenhagen conference, as these meetings are critical nowadays with the millennium development goals facing a major risk of failure."
"(CS) Commissioner, I too would like to say how disappointed I am that the promises of the G20 concerning assistance for the poorest countries during the economic crisis were clearly not meant seriously."
"The reality is that IMF assistance has so far been negligible."
"I would also like to call for a reform of the decision-making process so that the poorest countries can have a greater say in decision making, particularly within the Bretton Woods system."
"At the same time, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether it has been possible to maintain, in particular, health assistance and education in ACP countries at least at pre-crisis levels?"
"I am asking mainly because there has been a drastic reduction in financial aid from many countries, including European ones."
"That said, Commissioner, I wish you success in your new role."
"(SK) Commissioner, the issue we are discussing is highly important and topical, not only because the EU needs to have a clear idea about development policy at the moment but also because we need to explain it clearly and intelligibly to our fellow citizens."
"More than ever before, the level of development aid can now influence illegal immigration, public order, epidemics and also - as the IMF has pointed out - the increase in private sector debt in developing countries."
"I would like to emphasise the regular control of finances both by donors and recipients of funding."
"We live in our various countries and we hear criticisms of the EU's development policy."
"The consensus in the European Parliament which Mr Michel spoke of is not always so evident in the countries of the EU."
"It is only through the effectiveness and transparency of development aid that we can convince people that it is justified and limit any cut-backs."
"(FI) Mr President, it is extremely important that, at this stage, Europe shows moral leadership, and Member States must honour all their commitments as well as the Millennium Development Goals."
"Of course, we are suffering from relative poverty during this present economic downturn, but we need to remember that in the developing countries, they are suffering from absolute poverty, and people are dying of hunger and disease."
"More than 10 Member States in the Union, however, have said they will cut their development cooperation contributions or slow down the rate at which they are set to increase."
"Obviously, we should remember that, important as it is to increase payments, it is equally important to ensure that they are used more effectively."
"There are various tools in place for this coordination of aid."
"One is the Official Development Assistance computer program, which has been trialled very successfully in Mozambique, and I hope that there will be investment in time and effort in this type of coordination in particular."
"That way, it will be very easy for us to improve our success in such a situation as this, where the amount of aid available is falling."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, yes, a crisis has hit the poorest countries the hardest and there is in fact not much that we can do about it."
"We can only talk about the remedies to get them back on track, and obviously this will take more time than it will take in the developed world because the mechanisms to produce new economic growth are much less developed in those countries."
"One of the remarks that have been made by several members is about the fact that a lot of Member States are in fact backtracking on their Official Development Assistance (ODA) engagements."
"The EU Member States agreed in 2005 individual minimum aid targets of 0.51% for EU-15 and 0.17% for EU-12, for the new Member States to be reached by 2010 and respectively 0.7% and 0.33% by 2015."
"The countries that had already achieved aid levels higher than these targets promised to maintain."
"Based on these confirmations and higher national pledges of some Member States, the EU should collectively reach 0.56% of ODA by 2010."
"I believe that the crisis should not be an excuse to water down donors' aid promises, and I will insist on remaining committed to delivering the promised aid levels, both for EU Member States as well as other donors."
"In 2008, the EU ODA has increased by around EUR 4 billion to a level of 0.40% of ODA and the collective EU ODA is forecast to continue increasing."
"On the basis of the information gathered from Member States, we foresee the EU collective ODA increasing to EUR 53.4 billion in 2009, which represents 0.44%, and EUR 58.7 billion, representing 0.48%, in 2010."
"This also means that, without additional steps by Member States to fulfil their individual targets, the collective targets for 2010 will not be achieved."
"The forecasted trend of a continuing increase in EU ODA relies on those Member States that are trying to respect their commitments, but efforts are required by all Member States, and I will continue to insist on that with the respective Member Sates."
"It is their responsibility."
"This is an engagement that they have taken up, and the crisis should not be an excuse to water down their engagements."
"I would even say, to the contrary."
"Several Members have also insisted on the reform of the international financial institutions."
"This is a target that I can fully subscribe to."
"The G20 has set out a precise timetable for governance reforms of the Bretton Woods institutions urging them to accelerate the implementation of their own plans for reform which predate the London Summit."
"Some deliverables are expected as early as April next year and I am confident that solutions can be found on outstanding issues."
"Given the current momentum in IMF reform created by the G20, the Commission underlines the importance of advancing the second phase of reform at the World Bank with a view to concluding it by spring 2010."
"The London Summit of 2 April 2009 will go down in the history of the G20 as one where development issues were handled in their own right and in the presence of developing countries' representatives."
"In preparation for the next G20, these last months have seen intense activity by the institution tasked with following up."
"In August, the IMF Board of Governors approved a USD 250 billion general allocation of IMF special drawing rights, of which USD 18 billion will go to low income countries, and the IMF will be called to account in Pittsburgh on other measures for low income countries."
"So this is, I think, a positive evolution."
"Louis Michel, my predecessor, has also insisted on the flexibility, claiming that the budgetary support mechanism is the most flexible we have, and this is obviously true but, of course, this also means that we need a counterpart with the developing countries and we need to be in a position to have political dialogue with them and also monitoring mechanisms, so it presupposes a minimum cooperation on their behalf, but, once that is in place, I also believe that, especially, sectoral budgetary support is a very adequate procedure."
"I do not quite understand why this resolution that has been introduced by the Committee on Development and refers to the G20 meeting of Pittsburgh is not being voted on before the G20 meeting."
"I do not grasp that."
"There will probably be one or another technical explanation for that but I think it gives the wrong signal from this newly elected Parliament that we are going to debate such a resolution after the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, which is due to happen, if I remember correctly, from 22 to 24 September, before our next meeting in Strasbourg in October."
"This is not within my discretion but I must say that, together with Members who have advocated this, I very much deplore that we have not been able to vote upon this resolution during this part-session."
"Let me just mention that the decision to vote during the first October part-session was taken by the Conference of Presidents because, during that part-session, there will also be a debate on the G20 meeting."
"That is my explanation to your question."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first October part-session."

"Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year (debate)"
"The next item is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for the 2010 financial year."
"Mr President, it is a tremendous privilege for me to be here today."
"It makes me feel very humble and I am delighted to have the chance to present the Council's draft general budget to you."
"Europe is facing considerable challenges."
"The economic situation looked significantly more worrying six months ago, but it seems to have stabilised."
"The risk scenario is more balanced and the risk of being drawn deeper into a downward spiral has reduced."
"However, we face significant problems in the form of rising unemployment, growing budgetary deficits and increasing debt."
"In the light of this, there is a great need to maintain public finances that are sustainable in the long term."
"Many countries have a long way to go to balance their public finances."
"Demographics will exert huge pressure on public finances."
"The challenges we face with regard to the climate will require new resources and the redistribution of existing resources."
"Overall, this means, in our opinion, that the budget that we are to agree on should reflect a high degree of restraint in order to leave room for future needs, with the emphasis on European added value and investments which, in the short term, can bring us out of the economic crisis and, in the long term, can also strengthen our competitiveness."
"The Council's draft, which was adopted unanimously, deals with and contributes to meeting these challenges."
"It is a disciplined budget and a sound one from the point of view of state finances."
"It will promote research, education, competitiveness, innovation and the building of infrastructures, and it will promote cohesion."
"The Council's draft also contains margins for coping with unforeseen events."
"The logic behind our draft general budget is quite simple."
"If we want to stimulate growth, employment and prosperity, the textbooks say that we should pursue a sustainable, credible and cautious policy, but with investment in education, research and infrastructure and in levelling out wage differences throughout the EU."
"This is precisely what we have attempted to do."
"The Council's draft is balanced, while still being ambitious."
"Compared with the 2009 budget, our commitments have increased by 1.1% and the payment appropriations by nearly 4%."
"Our draft and the agreement that we want to reach must meet the following fundamental requirements, which were also applied during the Council's first reading."
"The budget must ensure that the EU's various political priorities for 2010 are adequately financed."
"We in the EU must be able to react quickly to the challenges that await us."
"There must be an emphasis on providing European added value."
"Budgetary discipline and sound economic management are required."
"Otherwise, we will not be able to take the gradual steps towards balancing public finances once again."
"It is important to respect the ceilings."
"The EU must have sufficient flexibility to cope with future needs and unforeseen events."
"It is vital for the EU budget to have adequate margins."
"The draft general budget that we are tabling represents EUR 138 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 121 billion in payment appropriations."
"The reductions that the Council has made in relation to the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission are based on a detailed analysis of the budget implementation, the budget forecast alerts and activity declarations, and we are looking at the capacity available to implement programmes and measures."
"The degree of implementation and the absorption capacity have been key factors in our analysis."
"I will now take a brief look at the individual headings."
"Sub-heading 1A, research and innovation, is the most important element, and adequate funds have been secured in our draft budget."
"Another area to which more resources will be directed is projects within the energy and infrastructure sectors."
"If we adjust for the accounting effects of the economic recovery plan, the increase in this area amounts to around 8%."
"Eight percent!"
"That is a lot, and as you all know, the financing of the European Economic Recovery Plan will be one of those topics that we will need to discuss during the autumn."
"Under sub-heading 1B, the Council accepted the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission."
"As regards payments, the Council believes that certain reductions can be made in relation to the preliminary draft budget, but I would like to stress that our draft nevertheless represents an increase in payment appropriations of 3.2% compared to 2009."
"Under heading 2, the Council is proposing substantial increases with regard to both commitment appropriations and payment appropriations compared with 2009, by 4.5% and 9.5%, respectively, if we adjust for the accounting effects of the recovery plan."
"With regard to heading 3, the Council made only a few small adjustments to the Commission's preliminary draft budget."
"Sufficient resources will be available for migration policy, including Frontex."
"As regards heading 4, it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in the best possible way."
"The Council therefore secured a margin of around EUR 310 million in its first reading."
"This is particularly justified in light of the letter of amendment, which includes additional needs in this area."
"As regards the Emergency Aid Reserve, the Council accepted the Commission's proposal regarding commitment appropriations."
"The common foreign and security policy is increasing in importance and the Council will therefore ensure that adequate funds are available for this."
"With regard to administration, the Council made certain targeted reductions in view of the economic situation and the specificities of each institution."
"The aim is to ensure that administrative expenditure does not increase faster than inflation."
"The institutions' requests for additional posts for new activities were not accepted, except for the new agencies that are planned for 2010 and for Frontex."
"At our conciliation meeting in July, it was highlighted once again how important it is for the recruitment associated with the enlargements of 2004 and 2007 to be carried out, and we agreed on a joint statement."
"On the same occasion, your representatives indicated that they were willing to try to find a common approach in respect of the building policy of the EU institutions and bodies."
"I am sure that such a statement will, fortunately, be forthcoming later in the autumn."
"Before I close, I would like to mention, and indeed to emphasise, the positive atmosphere that prevailed in our meetings with the European Parliament."
"I believe that constructive cooperation is the only way to achieve a sound budget."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to have an opportunity to speak to you this morning."
"I know that the first stages of this budgetary procedure - in particular the July conciliation - took place in a very positive atmosphere, and I hope we can build on this cooperation in the coming weeks."
"We still have some way to go in the 2010 budget procedures, and there are other important issues to agree on, such as the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan, so it is crucial that all three institutions work closely together."
"Turning to the actual situation following the Council's first reading and the establishment of the draft budget for 2010, the Commission acknowledges that the cuts proposed by the Council are less severe than in previous years."
"However, there are some particular concerns which I would like to highlight."
"The Commission regrets the Council's cut of EUR 1.8 billion in payment appropriations."
"These cuts are proportionately more significant for Headings 1A and 4, and sent a negative message in the priority areas of growth in jobs and the EU's international role, not least in relation to pre-accession assistance."
"The cuts proposed to the administrative support expenditure allowance, the administrative allowance for research and the agencies are particularly harsh."
"Rather than taking into account the specific situation of each agency, the cuts - with few exceptions - have been general, regardless of the stage of development or tasks of the agency concerned."
"The cuts in administrative support expenditure will hamper the implementation of programmes, particularly in the field of research and for external actions."
"I am hopeful that, in preparing its first reading, Parliament will seek to redress this situation."
"Although the cuts in Headings 1B and 2 are regrettable, I am partly reassured by the Council's proposed declaration on payments and by the second opportunity to examine the needs for agriculture in the upcoming letter of amendment which the Commission will present at the end of October."
"As announced, the Commission has now presented the budgetary authority with an amending letter to update the needs for Heading 4."
"The key elements of this concern: an additional EUR 95 million in commitment and EUR 60 million in payment appropriations to support the Palestinian Authority and reconstruction efforts in Gaza; and the need to consider the establishment of Bananas Accompanying Measures in view of the possible trade agreement that will affect the preferential regime of ACP banana-supplying countries."
"There is also an additional EUR 50 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 20 million in payment appropriations to assist developing countries in combating climate change, which should help to promote a successful outcome to the December Copenhagen Climate Change Conference."
"Under Heading 5 (Administration), the Commission was particularly modest in its PDB requests with a proposed increase in the Commission's administrative expenditure of only 0.9% compared to 2009."
"While this point has been acknowledged by the Presidency, it is rather disappointing that the Council has introduced further cuts to the Commission's administrative budget."
"In conclusion I am hopeful that the European Parliament will restore the appropriations cut by the Council and I am confident that our ongoing negotiations between the three institutions will be constructive and that we will achieve a satisfactory outcome to this budget procedure."
"Thank you, Mr Šemeta, for presenting the position of the Commission, and also for keeping to time, which is very important."
"I would like to say that this is an initial discussion."
"We are now going to discuss this in the Committee on Budgets and in other committees, and the main discussion will take place in a few weeks."
"I am going to speak in my mother tongue because I am hoping for a Europe where this act is a natural right in every parliament, not to mention in other areas of public life as well."
"In that Europe, there is no law preventing anyone from using their mother tongue, not even in Slovakia."
"I also expected that the current financial crisis would not only reduce production and increase unemployment, but also provide us with an opportunity to improve the European Union's budget through reform measures."
"Parliament already expressed its point of view in February."
"It was encouraging that the European Commission and Council expressed their agreement with it."
"Based on what I know about the draft, I am sad to say that the attempt to translate the fine words into the language of numbers was not a complete success."
"It is time to face up to the fact that no one is happy with the European Union's budget."
"The budget's revenue side is a serious burden for Member States, but the sum available is not sufficient for them to achieve their objectives."
"We are far away from achieving both full employment and a knowledge-based society."
"We spend large sums on agriculture, but dairy farmers, for instance, are affected by an unmanageable crisis."
"The biggest item on the expenditure side is the cohesion policy, but the gaps between regions are growing instead of decreasing."
"Researchers born and trained in Europe are working outside the European Union."
"We are therefore lagging behind when it comes to innovation as well."
"We hoped that the crisis would also provide an opportunity for us to have a shake-up and make the European Union's budget more successful and tangible for its citizens."
"We also hoped to use the budget not only in compliance with the rules and without any corruption, but also to take a look at the expenses and consider which programmes actually provide value and success for our money."
"What can we do now?"
"Parliament will endeavour to shape the budget in such a way that its message will be clearer to the EU's citizens."
"We want to increase those items which help tackle the crisis."
"With this in mind, we are putting forward our thoughts on implementing the economic stimulus plan."
"We want to tackle head on the challenges posed by climate change as well."
"What we would like is for the financial crisis to be tackled effectively, not only using a couple of billion euros from the plan earmarked for this purpose, but also with every item in the budget, so that Europeans realise that the European Union is not a superfluous expense, but an effective tool for solving their problems."
"I call on my fellow Members, the Council and Commission to support this."
"Mr President, Secretary of State, Commissioner, we can surely agree that when drawing up the European Parliament's budget, we must focus on our core mission, which is legislative work."
"Issues unconnected with this must be excluded from the budget as much as possible."
"We will discuss the final form of the budget today in an arbitration process involving the Presidency of the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgets."
"At this point, I would like to thank the representatives of the political groupings."
"In the meeting of the Committee on Budgets yesterday, they backed proposals to reduce the budget and measures which will lead to the better use of financial resources."
"We are constantly confronted with numerous shortcomings that prevent us from using our resources in a fully efficient manner."
"One example of this is the security for the buildings in which we are conducting these debates today."
"As you know, we spend four days a month in Strasbourg."
"Despite this, there were security guards stationed at both entrances 365 days a year until recently."
"The new Secretary General of the European Parliament and his colleagues discovered this and implemented measures which will bring annual savings of more than EUR 2 million."
"Another example is the Court of Auditors' reports on translations."
"Insufficient planning and insufficient communication or a complete absence of communication regarding the availability of translation resources prevents these resources being used effectively."
"The organisation which is supposed to provide translations often instructs external translators automatically without even checking whether there is any spare capacity available in the internal organisation."
"It is for this reason that we are proposing a reserve of 5% against the resources earmarked for translation in the budgets of the various institutions."
"We shall release this reserve when they show that they have tried to make full use of the resources of the internal organisation."
"In the area of translations alone, we can save around EUR 11 million annually."
"There are many similar examples."
"Most of them have a common denominator: we are making little use of independent studies into the use of resources and the organisation of work."
"I believe that the political will shown yesterday by the representatives of the various political groupings in the discussions of the Committee on Budgets will bear fruit."
"Expenses for the purchase, upkeep and rental of buildings form one of the main administrative expense items of EU institutions."
"There have been various cases in the past where institutions have purchased or rented property using methods that were not entirely efficient."
"According to the Court of Auditors, the institutions do not cooperate in these areas or even fail to assess their own policies."
"We have therefore asked the European Parliament administration to draw up a medium-term strategic document on buildings."
"We wanted to adopt a sensible decision on this matter in the first reading."
"There is a need to draw up a joint policy on buildings, not only in the European Parliament, but also within the framework of all institutions, and to ensure better cooperation in this area."
"Secretary of State, I am delighted that, like us, the Council has adopted this as a priority objective and I would like to express my thanks for that."
"Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mr Šemeta on the confirmation obtained yesterday of his appointment as Commissioner responsible for the budget."
"We are convinced that we will enjoy the same quality of relations with him as those which we established with his predecessor, and we wish him a political career that is as brilliant as that of Mrs Grybauskaitė."
"Mr President, we are going through a period of global crisis, of preparation for major diplomatic events and of institutional uncertainty within the Union itself."
"In a period such as this, the Committee on Budgets will seek to adopt a cooperative attitude."
"As our rapporteur said, we regret the cuts made by the Council in the Commission's proposals but, at the same time, we understand that the state of the Member States' public finances prevents them from going much further this year."
"For the 2010 budget, as has been said, we have an obligation to produce results: namely, balancing the financing of the 2010 section of the recovery plan."
"We know that redeployments will be necessary, but they must not focus on other political priorities previously decided on together by Parliament and by the Council."
"Beyond 2010, Parliament will hope to undertake work jointly with the Commission, the Council, the Swedish Presidency and the future Spanish Presidency on three major issues for the future."
"If, of course, things turn out as we hope in Ireland, the first issue will be the implementation of the procedure, schedule and working methods required by the application of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The second issue will be the mid-term review of the financial perspective."
"Between the joint decision on the multiannual financial framework taken in May 2006 and now, there has been the financial crisis, the very strong pressures on the price of energy, raw materials and even foodstuffs, and the negotiations on climate change."
"There has also been - I am sorry to say - the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, as is plain to see today."
"It is therefore a thorough review of our multiannual guidelines that we need."
"This will be the first task of the new Commission."
"Lastly, the third and final issue will be the reform of the resources that make up the European budget."
"We knew before the crisis that none of the Member States wanted to pay for Europe's spending any more."
"Since the crisis, none of the Member States can pay for this spending any more."
"Our financial contribution to the economic recovery will represent scarcely 0.03% of the Union's GDP."
"We are fully aware of the extreme difficulty of the issue, but the European Parliament started work on it four years ago with the national parliaments, and it intends to put itself in a position to propose some areas of work so as to launch the debate next year."
"Mr President, we have heard from both the Commission and the European Parliament that we will have several difficult issues to deal with during the autumn."
"Hopefully, we will have some easy ones to deal with, too."
"One of the most difficult issues is going to be the recovery plan and how it is to be financed."
"At the same time, I am very hopeful that we will succeed."
"I know that we will succeed."
"There is no alternative."
"Another issue that we face, both in the short term and in the long term, is, of course, the climate and the financing of climate policy."
"Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for allowing me to speak here today."
"The debate is closed."
"I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his appointment."
"Commissioner, great careers await commissioners from Lithuania."
"We wish you much success, both in the Commission and in the future."
"Your predecessor is, today, the Head of State in Lithuania."
"Immigration, the role of Frontex and cooperation among Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on immigration, the role of Frontex, and cooperation among Member States."
"Mr President, issues concerning migration are always topical in the EU's work."
"An important element in dealing with migratory flows is border control."
"Free movement for people within the EU and the absence of controls at internal borders bring a shared responsibility and an increased requirement for proper and effective management of our external borders."
"The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) is responsible for coordinating and supporting Member States' efforts to monitor and control the EU's external borders."
"Frontex is an important element in the EU's integrated border management strategy."
"Since its launch in 2005, Frontex's capacity has been progressively expanded."
"In line with an increased budget, Frontex now plays an even greater role in managing the operational cooperation between Member States in connection with the control of the EU's external borders."
"The Agency is currently coordinating a number of joint operations and pilot projects at maritime, land and air borders with a view to combating illegal immigration, with a particular emphasis on certain high-risk areas such as the southern maritime borders of the EU, although the northern and eastern borders are also covered."
"In the Council, we have, on several occasions, emphasised the need to develop and strengthen Frontex."
"The Council's conclusions from 2008 give the political priorities for the continued development of the Agency."
"In the short term, it was stressed that Frontex must be allocated the necessary resources and that maximum use must be made of the equipment provided by the Member States within the framework of the Centralised Record of Available Technical Equipment (CRATE)."
"The Council also urged Frontex to foster cooperation with other border control authorities, including customs authorities, and with third countries with regard to border control."
"In the long term, it was emphasised that the future development of Frontex operations should still continue to be carried out in stages."
"The Council welcomed the Commission's plan to examine how Frontex's mandate can be extended to enable increased cooperation with third countries."
"An evaluation of the Frontex Regulation is currently being carried out and the Commission will present a proposal for possible amendments at the beginning of 2010."
"The Council is looking forward to adopting a position on the Commission's proposed amendments together with the European Parliament."
"It was also emphasised in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which was adopted by the European Council in October 2008, that the Agency's role and resources for cooperation need to be strengthened."
"The Pact also referred to the possibility of establishing separate divisions within Frontex, as conditions differ so markedly, for example, at the land border in the east compared with the maritime border in the south."
"In the light of the events in the Mediterranean, the European Council, in its conclusions from June 2009, also emphasised the need to increase efforts to prevent and combat illegal immigration and to prevent any future human tragedies at the EU's southern maritime border."
"The need to tighten up border controls and the need for clear rules for joint patrols and the landing of those that are rescued, as well as the increased use of joint repatriation flights, were given particular emphasis."
"In conclusion, I would like to clarify the fact that the situation in the Mediterranean does not only involve taking action in the area of border control."
"This situation requires a broad spectrum of both short-term and long-term measures."
"The starting point in this regard should be the EU's global approach to migration, which includes cooperation and measures within the entire migration policy area."
"Enhanced cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is fundamental and the dialogue with third countries should be intensified in areas such as legal immigration, migration and development, capacity building and the repatriation of people who have no need of protection."
"This dialogue must be based on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility."
"Mr President, migration is a priority issue that will be keeping the institution very busy, and I wish to thank Mr Tobias Billström, who is well acquainted with this problem."
"We are in the process of drafting an immigration policy based on three pillars: respect for the right of asylum, the fight against illegal immigration, and European coordination to provide for legal migration."
"Access to EU territory must be gained in accordance with certain rules, in compliance with national policies and with common standards that the Union implements, and not illegally, often at the cost of human lives."
"The Mediterranean must remain the link between our civilisations rather than a place of misery and desolation."
"The challenge of illegal immigration cannot be solved exclusively by those Member States that are more particularly exposed because their borders coincide with the external border of the Union."
"It really is important for all of the EU Member States to show solidarity in the face of this challenge."
"The Union has already adopted common rules, has devoted resources to this and has developed significant means of action."
"That said, it is true that new initiatives will be necessary given the scale of the illegal migratory flows."
"The challenge of illegal migration does, of course, require an effective prevention strategy, implemented in partnership with all of the countries located along the migratory routes."
"The European Union is doing all it can to develop these dialogues and this cooperation."
"The aim of this global approach is to deal with all of the main dimensions of immigration together and in a balanced way."
"As Mr Billström just said, this approach guides our work in the Mediterranean, which is the meeting point of the migratory flows coming from the different regions and passing through various countries in Asia and Africa."
"The Commission has made a firm commitment to promote the appropriate bilateral regional cooperation frameworks."
"Faced with the proliferation of unacceptable human tragedies, I travelled to these European access points: Lampedusa, Malta, the Canary Islands and Greece."
"I started a debate within the Commission and I referred suggestions of a more united and effective European policy to my ministerial colleagues within the Council."
"The work subsequently carried out formed the basis of a series of decisions taken by the June European Council."
"Since then, the Commission has been working on three major themes."
"Firstly, asylum: the European Council called for the coordination of voluntary measures concerning the internal distribution of recipients of international protection who reside in the Member States most exposed to these pressures."
"The Commission responded to this appeal by launching, in July, a pilot project to help Malta."
"It has made provision for Community funding opportunities for Member States that will be willing to show solidarity with Malta."
"To date, France has agreed to resettle almost 100 refugees on its territory."
"I should like this gesture, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, to be repeated by other Member States."
"On 2 September, I also presented the European Parliament and the Council with a communication proposing a common European programme on the resettlement of refugees from third countries."
"I know, Mr Billström, that this programme is close to your heart."
"It outlines common annual priorities in relation to resettlement, together with proposals on how to make more effective use of the financial aid granted to the Member States under the European Refugee Fund."
"The European Asylum Support Office must be able to play a dominant role in the effective implementation of these initiatives."
"The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the creation of this Office is currently being examined within the Community institutions."
"I should really like it if Parliament and the Council could come to an agreement under the Swedish Presidency in order to make this Support Office operational in 2010, and I am very much counting on our Commission and on the Swedish Presidency."
"That is all as regards asylum."
"The second theme is that of the external borders."
"As Mr Billström explained very well, the European Council wanted the border control operations coordinated by Frontex to be strengthened."
"It asked us to lay down clear rules of engagement for the joint patrols, and precise provisions for the disembarkation of rescued persons and for the organisation of common return flights."
"We must also examine how Frontex can cooperate with third countries."
"The budget for financing Frontex operations in 2009 has been increased to EUR 36 million, and we are currently looking into how Frontex can organise the repatriation of illegal migrants."
"It should be pointed out that the border control operations are conducted in accordance with Community law, in particular with the Schengen Borders Code."
"Fundamental rights and the prohibition of return must be respected."
"In maritime areas, these operations must also be conducted in accordance with international maritime law."
"However, these rules are not interpreted or applied uniformly by the Member States."
"That is why we are going to try to see how these rules can be developed and clarified so that Community law and international law can be applied better within the context of these operations."
"We are also busy preparing a proposal that will allow changes to the regulation establishing the Frontex agency and its working methods."
"This proposal will be submitted in early 2010."
"It will cover the European Parliament's report and the assessment that will have been carried out by the agency in accordance with Article 33 of the Frontex regulation."
"The aim is to optimise and strengthen the role of Frontex in border cooperation matters."
"I now come to the third theme."
"The European Council stressed the need for enhanced cooperation with the main countries of origin and of transit and asked the Commission to look at possible ways of cooperating in practice with these countries."
"To follow up on this request, the Commission has put a great deal of effort into stepping up the dialogue and cooperation with Libya and Turkey, which are the two key countries on the illegal migration routes in the Mediterranean."
"With regard to Libya, Mr Billström and I sent a letter in July proposing to our Libyan partners that we cooperate in a number of areas to ensure the joint and balanced management of migratory flows from Libya."
"We explained to the Libyan authorities that we were willing to help them not only to strengthen their capacities to prevent migrants from illegally entering and leaving their territory, but also to improve the treatment of migrants in accordance with human rights and with international rules and to identify and assist migrants who need international protection."
"The Commission already cofinances pilot measures through the United Nations HCR, the International Organisation for Migration and the Italian Ministry of the Interior."
"However, the only way in which we will be able to give the required scope to our action is with a clear commitment from the Libyan authorities."
"I make no secret of the fact, Mr Billström, that I am somewhat eagerly awaiting the reply to our letter."
"With regard to Turkey, the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Jonathan Faull, is today on an assignment in Ankara to investigate the extent to which, and the means by which, an increase in cooperation could encourage the Turkish authorities to become more involved in a more responsible form of migration management, with the aim both of re-admitting illegal immigrants and, above all, of providing international protection for refugees."
"If Turkey and Libya are willing to take up our offers, we and Mr Billström will be able to visit these two countries before the end of the year."
"Finally, I should like to mention the Stockholm programme, which must lay the foundations for a more effective common policy and which will enable us to promote coordinated immigration in the spirit of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"We submitted our proposals in June, and they were given a favourable reception at the informal ministerial debate held in July by the Swedish Presidency."
"I shall not repeat what I said just now, that is, the three major themes of this policy, a common asylum system in line with our humanitarian traditions, more effective control of illegal immigration through more integrated management of our internal borders and our visa policy, and then, of course, the increased effectiveness of our fight against human trafficking and the implementation of a specific return policy aimed at the long-term reintegration of migrants into their community of origin, as well as the opening up to legal migration within a framework that guarantees that the needs of host countries are accommodated, without forgetting the needs of countries of origin or respect for the rights of migrants."
"There you have it."
"I have overrun slightly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, but I wanted to follow on from Mr Billström's very sound explanations by highlighting the major themes of a policy, of a European strategy that I believe is now beginning to take shape."
"Our Member States still need to show the full solidarity and the determination necessary to implement this strategy."
"I am very much counting on the European Parliament to help us in this matter."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (MT) Thank you, Mr President, I would also like to welcome Minister Billström and, in particular, the Vice-President of the European Commission, Jacques Barrot."
"Allow me Mr President, to congratulate and thank the Vice-President of the European Commission for the considerable and genuine efforts that he has undertaken in the field of immigration and asylum."
"I would like to extend my appreciation and gratitude to Mr Barrot for the passion with which he has chosen to carry out this work, and for the concrete initiatives which he has launched in this difficult, controversial and sensitive area."
"This brings me on to the first point I would like to raise, Mr President, regarding the complexity of this subject."
"It is easy to point fingers at one country or other: however, we have to analyse the situation seriously and thoroughly."
"Otherwise we run the risk of falling prey to the absurd."
"Allow me to give an example. Lately, there has been criticism levelled at the Italian Government because they promptly sent arriving immigrants back to Libya."
"However, we have to understand that as a result of Italy's actions, the number of immigrants that have chosen to brave the hazardous journey and risk their lives have decreased considerably this year."
"It is important to realise that this return system has dealt a big blow to organised crime and human traffickers."
"This means that while it is doubtlessly necessary to respect immigrants' right to asylum, it is likewise imperative to persevere in our efforts to put a stop once and for all to this tragedy which is taking place in the Mediterranean."
"What is just as important is to go on battling human traffickers who are exploiting the misery and difficulties that immigrants wishing to cross over to Europe are experiencing."
"Therefore, we must keep the complexity of the subject in mind at all times."
"I would like to mention some other points."
"We must improve upon Frontex, especially with regard to the potential cooperation that could take place between countries, and which include concrete issues such as those tied to return policies involving more than one country."
"Unfortunately, in this field, Frontex has not yet made enough effort."
"The initiatives cited by Vice-President Barrot also merit attention, such as the general resettlement programme, the pilot project for countries like Malta and the establishment of an asylum office."
"These are initiatives that need to be put into place instantly."
"To conclude, another equally important factor that requires attention is cooperation with Libya and other third countries which are the departure points for immigrants."
"Without the cooperation of these countries we will get nowhere."
"Mr President, Mr Billström, Commissioner Barrot, I agree with the importance and support the emphasis that both the Presidency and the Commission have placed on identifying this as one of the most influential dimensions of globalisation that needs a European response."
"This is an area in which Europe can make sense, by adding value to the management of one of the most unequivocal dimensions of globalisation, namely the unprecedented dimension taken on by migration, and therefore migratory flows and their impact in all areas of importance to European integration."
"This phenomenon cannot be tackled by any of the Member States on their own, based on their individual capacities."
"As a result, we need a common policy, which has still not been developed."
"Everything that has been done to develop this common policy, which must be developed, should have occurred under the European Constitution and under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, this policy has still not been developed."
"Everything that has been done is in anticipation of what must be done and is still in the very early stages."
"However, it is clear that the response must be coherent with the European identity."
"As a result, commitment to the correction of inequalities at source, by reinforcing development cooperation, is the first point."
"Secondly, we need to reinforce the fight against the political and criminal dimensions of this phenomenon, by also tackling those organisations which traffic human beings."
"At the same time, we must improve information on the risks of illegal immigration and on illegal trafficking, training at source and illegal employment."
"The response must involve legal migration, as an alternative to illegal immigration."
"Finally, we must make a serious commitment to human rights."
"That involves the dimensions of asylum and refugees, and also compliance with the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which was signed in October 2008."
"However, in the meantime, we must reinforce the European external border, in terms of both its control and our joint responsibility for it."
"The impact of illegal immigration in Italy, Spain or Greece - as evident in Spain in relation to the southern Mediterranean border, and also in the Canary Islands, with the canoes that arrive full of desperate people - is not purely a Spanish or an Italian matter."
"It is a European matter, which does not simply require solidarity with Spain or Italy, or even less a hope that Spain and Italy will comply with the European model in their bilateral relations with African countries."
"No, it is a joint responsibility, which requires a joint response."
"That is why the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has supported the strengthening of Frontex and also the increase of its budget, which we hope will be supported in this House, because we support the emphasis and importance placed on this matter by the Swedish Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Mr Barrot and Mr Billström."
"Back on 31 August, I tabled a priority question to the Commission."
"It is true that the number of migrants reaching Italian and Libyan shores has fallen, but this is because the number of dead which the Mediterranean Sea continues to receive has risen."
"Alas, the Mediterranean has now become a mass grave and the Berlusconi Government, to wit, the Italian Government, has signed an agreement with Libya which unfortunately allows Italy to refuse entry not only to migrants, but also refugees from countries where there is persecution or civil war, such as Somalia and Eritrea, and denies these poor people the right to seek asylum, thereby breaching every international rule and the Geneva Convention in particular."
"I would remind you that non-refoulement is a principle which knows no geographical boundaries and which cannot be haggled over or negotiated under any circumstances."
"We do not want to continue thinking that ultimately, this Italy-Libya agreement boils down to economic interests worth around EUR 5 000 billion."
"I demand that the Commission does not - if this is its intention - conclude an EU-Libya agreement similar to the Italian one, as we have seen the results of that despicable agreement."
"I repeat, alas this agreement forces these people to undergo torture, because this is what we are dealing with: the detention centres to which they are taken in Libya are torture, according to press reports and also photographs, for example, photographs which show many of these immigrants in Ganfuda prison, 10 kilometres from Benghazi."
"This is torture, which I do not believe is accounted for in any friendship or institutional agreements."
"As highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the non-refoulement principle prevents people being returned to territories where their lives could be considered to be in danger or their freedom could be threatened."
"Sending these people back to Libya which, I would again remind you, has neither signed nor ratified the Geneva Convention, seems truly unbelievable."
"Moreover, to add insult to injury, illegal immigration is a criminal offence in Italy so, for example, after the dramatic landing at the end of August in which many Somalis lost their lives, those few, I think four or five Somalis who managed to reach their destination have, among other things, been accused of immigration and are therefore now being prosecuted under Italian law."
"I call on the Commission now to take real action, to assess whether the Italy-Libya agreement complies with international law and finally bring about a decisive change of course by not supporting the Italian Government's nefarious policy."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the Commission's joint EU resettlement programme certainly has noble ambitions, which aim to encourage greater cooperation between national governments regarding the resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers."
"However, as a British Conservative, I do remain worried about its implementation."
"We do not want to see the continuation of problems like those we have had at Sangatte in France."
"I think that cooperation and solidarity across the European Union is, of course, important when discussing the burdens that nations face but we must better distinguish economic migrants from asylum seekers."
"They obviously have every right to seek sanctuary, but we must also have legislation that does not tie individual nations' hands regarding who is accepted and who gets asylum."
"A collective approach such as the one the Commission is proposing might undermine each EU nation's ability to decide this."
"Meanwhile, though, I think a major priority should be securing the southern borders."
"Frontex must play a more prominent part in this regard in order to act as a strong deterrent to economic migrants wishing to make the hazardous trip across the Mediterranean."
"We must act more strongly against the various third countries that irresponsibly encourage those activities."
"The Commission says it will be national governments that ultimately decide the number of people they accept, and that Britain and other countries will not be forced to accept large numbers of economic migrants that it cannot cope with or cannot support in these economically challenging times."
"That is necessary and right."
"Countries like Britain need guarantees that our asylum and immigration policy remains for us to decide and guarantees also that the EU's approach will remain one of open cooperation and not one of compulsion."
"Mr President, Mr Billström, Commissioner Barrot, the start of this legislative term offers us an excellent opportunity to rethink our immigration policy."
"We currently have an immigration policy that is based on manifest hypocrisy and cynicism."
"We say that the European project would be impossible without migrant workers, and yet we are criminalising them with legislation such as the Return Directive, which has been aptly named the 'Directive of Shame', and which fails to comply with the principles and values of the European Union."
"This policy of trying to make Europe into a fortress at this time of crisis, which is a triple crisis in terms of food, finance and energy, is not understood by everyone, because our work is poor and heading in the wrong direction."
"If Europe is needed and, in particular, if Europe is needed thanks to migrant workers, then we must respect all their rights and not make them into criminals, as the European Union is doing."
"This is simply bringing more pain to families that are just trying to escape war or hunger."
"As a result, the best calling card at next spring's summit of Heads of State or Government in Madrid, between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean, would be to repeal this 'Directive of Shame', which does not comply with our principles and values and which is not understood by any government, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, from where thousands of migrant workers come to the European Union."
"I therefore call for serious consideration to be given to repealing this 'Directive of Shame'."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the measures under discussion are part of the existing so-called area of justice, freedom and security, of which immigration is a part."
"This is about a common immigration and asylum policy and, however much the British Government may lie to the British people, we know that they intend that Britain should eventually be bound by it."
"But a 'one-size-fits-all' immigration policy will not work for Britain."
"Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, more densely populated, surprisingly, than India, China or Japan."
"Net immigration to Britain is now running at about 230 000 people per annum, adding over a million new people to the population every five years."
"The population will rise from its current 61.4 million, an all-time high, to about 70 million plus in 2031, and then spiral ever upwards."
"All this growth is due to immigration and births to immigrants."
"The UK Independence Party is not opposed to some immigration, but this should be strictly controlled and for the benefit of Britain and not the European Union or anybody else."
"Britain does not need a common European immigration policy."
"What we need to do is end mass immigration now and introduce a strictly limited and controlled immigration policy."
"We should apply the terms of the 1951 Convention on Refugees, which requires them to seek sanctuary in the first designated safe country they come to - which is not a little island off the coast of Europe called Britain."
"We should end the promotion of multiculturalism, which is divisive and a recipe for conflict, and assimilate and integrate existing migrants into a common culture with respect for a common set of political and legal institutions."
"There should be no place in Britain - and, I suggest, anywhere in Europe - for Sharia law."
"(NL) Mr President, Frontex is not working."
"The budget for Poseidon, the operation currently under way, is EUR 11 million."
"This is pointless."
"It is money down the drain."
"Direct returns and a crackdown on the countries that make this immigration possible is the only solution."
"The common asylum and immigration policy is not in the interests of the Dutch people."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom, on whose behalf I am speaking, is vehemently opposed to this policy."
"It will result in even more people with no prospects entering Europe."
"The Dutch people do not need solidarity, what they need is for us to stand up here for Dutch interests."
"Let there be an end to it then."
"I should like to give a further reaction to the Swedish Presidency."
"This Presidency takes the view that Europe should further open its borders to mass immigration for the sake of its labour market."
"The Party for Freedom rejects this out of hand."
"It is a smoke screen to enable mass immigration."
"Look at what is happening in the big cities - look at the enormous problems they face."
"Think about your own people, think about your own country, think about your own culture."
"We shall be doing so, in any case."
"I should like to add that enough is enough."
"Let there be an end to mass immigration; it has gone far enough."
"(ES) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the challenges in terms of migration remain the same, as too does our commitment to overcome them."
"These challenges are as follows: the first is to move towards a common migration policy; the second is to greatly improve the organisation of legal migration; the third is to improve integration procedures; the fourth is to combat illegal or clandestine immigration with absolute determination; the fifth is to develop Frontex further; the sixth is to improve procedures, conventions and agreements with countries of origin and transit; and the seventh is to make progress with a common asylum policy."
"The European Asylum Support Office must, in 2010, become a fair, genuine and egalitarian office, which shares out the responsibility in a way that ensures solidarity and which offers international or subsidiary protection going forward."
"As regards Frontex, it is a matter of coordination and cooperation; under no circumstances is it a replacement for national competences."
"The need to increase Frontex missions to the south of our borders, in southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and on the Atlantic front, is not just the European Union's response to the migratory pressure developing in Greece, Malta, Italy or Spain; it is also a humanitarian response to prevent death and avoid drama."
"Just look at what has happened with the Frontex budget: it has gone from EUR 6 million in 2005 to EUR 78 or 83 million in 2010."
"However, Mr President, our concern is that Frontex is incapable of managing the budget that Parliament has given it."
"This would be unacceptable, because there are many challenges and missions to be tackled."
"It is vital that Frontex breathes life into CRATE, the Centralised Record of Available Technical Equipment."
"It is also vital that the Member States' commitment to CRATE becomes effective."
"We need to have more and better coordination with Europol."
"We need to manage Iconex and, Mr President, in terms of safeguarding human rights, we need to have more and better coordination between Frontex and the International Organisation for Migration and also the UNHCR."
"These are the challenges and these are our commitments."
"Mr President, no one underestimates the enormous difficulties of creating the balance mentioned by the chair of our committee, and of the migration pressures which face the European Union and the pressures that we face in the Mediterranean."
"Yet again this summer, we have been reminded of the harsh reality faced by migrants and asylum seekers facing persecution and fleeing poverty."
"Frontex undoubtedly plays a key role in Europe's approach to migration."
"As we build a more coordinated EU system for managing our external borders, the importance of Frontex increases."
"Therefore, my group believes that it is crucial to get the balance right: the balance between, on the one hand, resourcing Frontex - as many colleagues have mentioned - and, on the other hand, ensuring that Frontex has a stronger appreciation of the humanitarian aspects of its work."
"For example, how can Frontex help bring down the tragic number of deaths at sea, over 12 000 in the last 10 years?"
"Sea rescue operations have therefore to be included in its remit."
"The devil is in the detail."
"Many of these policies need to work on the ground, and I know that Parliament, Commission and Council are trying to do this."
"We must ensure that Frontex does not simply become a mechanism for keeping people out of Europe."
"Those who are legitimately in need of protection must be granted access to EU territory."
"Commissioner, you spoke about the principle of non-refoulement."
"It is important that you restated it."
"The situation for Italy and Libya is, of course, something which my colleagues from Italy will speak more about, but this principle must not be violated by anyone or any country."
"We are in a situation where non-refoulement will happen even with countries which have not signed the 1951 Convention."
"It is important that we uphold these human rights."
"We must not shy away from our responsibilities to provide protection to those who need it."
"Frontex therefore needs to be part of a fair and balanced approach to migration and asylum."
"We must ensure that the asylum package is implemented, and we must ensure that legal migration and the protection of refugees are held in balance."
"Mr President, the British press, assisted to such a conclusion by paranoid and Euro-sceptic MEPs, has scaremongered that a future Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, which Mr Barroso has accepted at the proposal of the ALDE Group, will force the UK to accept more asylum seekers from across Europe."
"This is not true."
"As Vice-President Barrot has confirmed, the pilot project to assist Malta is voluntary and the proposed scheme to resettle UNHCR-approved refugees directly from outside Europe would also be non-compulsory."
"No element of EU policy has ever involved quotas or compulsion on national acceptance of migrants."
"However, what we do try and get is voluntary solidarity, and I do hope that a future Fundamental Rights Commissioner will make a contribution to stopping migrants meeting their death in the Mediterranean."
"Ten years ago next month, the EU set the goal of a common asylum system and coordinated migration policies."
"Despite some considerable efforts, especially by the European Commission with the support of MEPs, we are clearly a long way from that."
"The top priority is to get some proper management of the flows, which are usually what are called 'mixed flows' of refugees and job-seeking migrants, so as to distinguish between the two."
"This is to give confidence to the European public of proper management as well as to stop loss of life and to ensure protection for those qualifying for it."
"If people in frail boats are pushed back out to sea and never assessed for protection, none of those goals is achieved."
"I am shocked to hear from Commissioner Barrot that Member States do not apply maritime law uniformly."
"Such disarray is unacceptable."
"Frontex must be properly resourced and respect human rights of individuals."
"Those individuals must be allowed to land and be assessed for asylum status and sorted into refugees and those not qualified to stay."
"EU Member States must, if necessary, be taken to the European Court of Justice for failing to do so, and the idea, as my colleague Sonia Alfano has said, that Libya is capable of doing that job instead is completely outrageous given its gross human rights abuses."
"A rational European immigration policy would involve some common framework of criteria for economic migration within which Member States accepting such migrants can operate under their own decisions on the numbers they take."
"What we need is the coordination, the common standards, the common framework and then the solidarity as well."
"Mr President, I do not really share your enthusiasm about Frontex."
"We have heard reports from Frontex as well as from Member States that they have violated human rights, the right to non-refoulement and given no possibility for refugees to apply for asylum, and those violations of human rights are done in the name of the European Union."
"Minister Billström, you have said that we need some checks and balances on our external borders but, I ask you, why cannot we have some checks and balances on those people who are working and defending our external borders?"
"Why cannot we have some transparency and clarity about Frontex and what they are doing?"
"We need clarity and transparency in this House, in the European Parliament, about Frontex's deeds."
"We need clarity about what is the stage of the procedure of the new rules of Frontex that you mentioned, Commissioner, and we need some clarification about how refugees can obtain international protection when they are intercepted at sea."
"We also need transparency about the deals that are being made with third countries and what happens exactly to the EU money that is being put into Libya, for example."
"I doubt whether what you called Libya's assistance to refugees is actually helpful to refugees but here again, we are just lacking transparency and if, as you said, not even Member States interpret the rights of migrants the same way as you do, then how are you going to make sure that third countries such as Libya are going to follow your sort of interpretation?"
"I would like to remind you that Parliament has always supported the idea of making the sharing of responsibility to deal with asylum applications obligatory, and I think your report of the pilot project where only France took a very, very small, almost ridiculous, number of 100 refugees from Malta shows that we are not getting far with the voluntary solidarity."
"We need some obligation here."
"(PL) We want to fight immigration."
"It is a great problem."
"In the meantime, our notice board and computer are going wrong."
"Let us tackle the things which we can really tackle effectively."
"Migration is, of course, one of the greatest problems facing Europe today."
"What is more, it is a problem not just for us politicians, but it is also a problem for the people of the European Union's Member States."
"It is, perhaps, one of the main challenges currently facing the political class in Europe, and one of the main problems of our electors."
"Immigration has more than one name, because my esteemed fellow Members have spoken today about immigration from Africa, which mainly affects the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, and what they said is, in a certain sense, justified."
"I represent a country - Poland - where this illegal immigration is, of course, smaller, but people come to us from the countries of the former Soviet Union, and some from Asia."
"We are faced with a question about the philosophy of the EU's fight against illegal immigration, and - let us put it simply - also against restrictions on legal immigration."
"Does Frontex have to bear the brunt of this fight?"
"Is this really advisable?"
"Would it not be more effective for the extra money which we want to give Frontex to be allocated to the countries which have the greatest problem with illegal immigration, and also to EU Member States whose borders are part of the EU's external borders?"
"Mr President, it seems to me, as I finish, that this would be more advisable."
"(PT) Mr Billström, Mr Barrot, we have no choice regarding the Geneva Convention and human rights."
"Our only option is to comply with the conventions that we have signed."
"The law is clear: sending refugees who arrive on European shores to countries that have not signed the Geneva Convention on refugees is a violation of the Geneva Convention."
"This is not an abstract point of law; it is a real argument."
"When, through Frontex or the Member States, we send refugees to Libya, we are in breach of the convention, not least because we know from the Italian Government's own figures that 75% of the people who reach European shores apply for asylum, and 50% of those - about 38%, or a third of the total - are entitled to humanitarian protection."
"Political choices lead to moral choices, and right now we are faced with a moral choice."
"Is it right, is it really moral, that more than 14 000 people have died trying to reach the coast of Europe in recent years?"
"Is it really moral that a large proportion of those people who risk their lives should be entitled to asylum in the first place?"
"Is it really necessary that they should have to risk their lives?"
"No, they should not have to do so."
"We have been saying for a long time that a purely repressive immigration policy, such as the one that has been followed, presents us with these life or death choices for people's lives and makes us all jointly responsible for each life or death choice."
"It is not by throwing money at Frontex now, at the beginning of its mandate - money that Frontex cannot spend and that the Commission says it is inadvisable to give to Frontex at this time - it is not by doing this that we will solve the problem."
"The way in which we can solve the problem is by re-examining Frontex's mandate, and then Frontex might need more money."
"For that to happen, Frontex would have to cooperate and provide the UNHCR with full information; for that to happen, Frontex would have to include humanitarian concerns in its policies, which it does not do at the moment."
"Just as serious, ladies and gentlemen, is the proposal regarding refugee funds: while we are investing more in Frontex, these funds are being cut back."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, frankly I am annoyed that certain Italian fellow Members have not wasted the opportunity to reopen the same old controversy, with the sole aim of attacking the Italian Government."
"When it comes to immigration, we should no longer engage in ideological manipulation, but go to the heart of the guidelines set out by the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which is based on the values of integration and solidarity."
"I genuinely appreciate the Commission's efforts in recent years, but Commissioner Barrot will agree with me when I say that we need to speed things up to create a true European strategy on immigration, which prioritises the uncompromising fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings."
"We must take firm action against all those who profit from this trafficking, including employers who use illegal labour."
"Certainly, it is no longer acceptable to allow immigration to be a problem shouldered only by the border countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"The Commission's recent proposal for a joint reintegration programme is a step forward in terms of political and practical cooperation between Member States, but we urgently need to implement a series of initiatives to develop more effective intra-Community solidarity."
"That is why we are waiting for the announcement made by the President-in-Office of the European Union to become reality soon, an announcement echoing, among other things, a heartfelt plea by the Italian Minister, Franco Frattini, to launch a debate so that we can find a way to share fairly among Member States the burdens and responsibilities associated with the flows of illegal immigrants and political asylum seekers."
"This is the key point, in my view, because otherwise we end up in the paradoxical situation whereby some Member States, including Italy, Malta, Greece and Spain, are obliged to receive illegal immigrants, whereas others hide behind the discretional concept of solidarity on a voluntary basis."
"They cannot hide from this any longer."
"I would like to thank France which has offered to accept 100 people, 100 asylum seekers: 100 people, but that is out of the thousands, tens of thousands of asylum seekers."
"I therefore thank France, but it is a drop in the ocean."
"I will conclude by saying that, among other things, we can no longer view immigration as a panacea."
"In the absence of a serious cooperation policy for development, where Europe must take a leading role, we will be condemning part of the world to a certain and inevitable future of poverty and despair."
"(EL) Minister, Commissioner, Parliament has urgently called for cooperation at European level with immigrants' countries of origin and transit."
"These countries do not only include Libya."
"They also include Turkey."
"Apart from being a country of origin and transit within this framework, Turkey is also a candidate country."
"In other words, one could say that it has a dual obligation to respect the political principles and the institutions of the European Union."
"In at least four cases recently, Frontex helicopters were jammed by Turkish radar in Greek airspace while performing their duties."
"In fact, yesterday, a Turkish fighter plane threatened to force a Frontex helicopter to turn back."
"What do you intend to do and how will you react on behalf of the European Union to this harassment during action by a European institution such as Frontex?"
"Also, compulsory solidarity cannot only take the form of Frontex-type policing measures in the southern states."
"There must also be solidarity in terms of accepting immigrants arriving in our countries, which cannot sustain such large numbers every time."
"Here, the Commission and Council are promoting voluntary solidarity, which is not worth the paper it is written on."
"Can you tell us why you are not introducing compulsory solidarity here too?"
"Finally, the pilot programme between Italy, Malta and Libya should not be the only pilot programme."
"Why is there no pilot programme for turning immigrants back in Turkey, which is a gaping wound in terms of this particular problem?"
"Has the Greek Government ever asked for this, Commissioner, and you refused it?"
"Or did Libya, Italy and Malta simply come along and you accepted them without making any other requests?"
"(FR) Mr President, this gives me an opportunity to clarify two small points which, I believe - and as one of my fellow Members said just now - highlight the hypocritical nature of our policy."
"The first point concerns the Dublin agreements."
"Commissioner, you know the situation in Calais well; you know that, in Calais, many people could easily apply for and obtain political refugee status."
"Why do they not do so?"
"Because, as a result of the Dublin agreements, they are guaranteed to be sent to countries to which they do not want to go, and sometimes for excellent reasons."
"They do not want to go to Greece, where they have practically no chance of receiving refugee status."
"Today, the Dublin agreements are an instrument that is hostile to the protection of those people who need them most and which create inequality among the Member States."
"So let us stop talking about solidarity, when instruments are put in place that create inequality among the States."
"The second point concerns the readmission agreements."
"I fully understand, the aim is to negotiate these agreements with Turkey and with Libya, that is, to toy with the idea of having one huge environment of countries that are our neighbours and huge camps for holding the migratory flows."
"This is unacceptable for practical reasons, for moral reasons and for political reasons, and you know it, Mr Barrot!"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will immediately start by saying, without exaggeration, that for me, hospitality is a sacred value."
"Ultimately, it is solidarity between people which gives rise to the communities of a state, which are regulated by means of certain special obligations: rights and duties."
"Therefore as far as I am concerned, I am firmly opposed to anything that runs counter to this basic biblical principle."
"Clearly, it is the action of taking people in and also the ways in which we need to do this which combine to give rise to integration and all it entails."
"What can we do?"
"Where should we locate these desperate people who arrive in the Member States and, at the same time, how should we eliminate that ensuing friction which we sometimes see as resentment, anger and rage, leading to rather worrying forms of antagonism?"
"What should we do to ensure that safeguarding the right to asylum, a principle which has been cited in recent days too, does not, at the same time, leave the door open for fraudulent asylum seekers, which is the alibi certain people use: people who hide behind this universal right and who have nothing to do with the right to asylum, but everything to do with illegality and crime?"
"Do we really think, Mr Billström, that all this responsibility can be shouldered by individual states?"
"Until now, Europe has very probably acted with some uncertainty, but it seems to me that it can no longer put off establishing a united, serious approach to immigration."
"It cannot speak as it has been doing, with many discordant voices, and cannot force the most exposed and vulnerable individual frontline states into isolation."
"It cannot do so without a common position reached collectively, one which so far, we have not had, but whose essential principles are continually defended."
"It cannot, Mr President, fail to see its borders as a European issue instead of an issue for individual states."
"It cannot engage, as has already happened in this Chamber, in crude, theatrical performances in the argument over what the Italian Government or other governments are doing."
"For me, it is clearly unthinkable that the tragedies that have occurred off the coast of Lampedusa and in Ceuta and Melilla have nothing to do with Brussels, Berlin and Paris."
"Tension between the individual states and Europe stems from this and is causing problems, and this is also increasing Europe's democratic deficit, which is only set to get worse in the absence of a coordinated policy on immigration; it is heightening the impression that the self-interests of states prevail over the greater good."
"It is intensifying, Mr President, the frustrating perception that Brussels and Strasbourg all too often deal with obscure issues and not those which concern the public."
"Ultimately, it is undermining Europe's political identity."
"This is why I hope that the Swedish Presidency will begin to establish an agreement with the most vulnerable countries in order to think logically and bring about what has been lacking until now, namely a robust, balanced, sound and rigorous common policy on immigration."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, we called for this debate to draw the EU's attention to the grave violations of fundamental human rights taking place in Italy."
"Since May, over 1 000 migrants have been picked up at sea by the Italian authorities and handed over to Libya in the course of informal and indiscriminate refoulements without identifying the people, giving them the right to appeal or access to asylum procedures, with the danger that they will be subjected to inhumane and degrading treatment in Libya."
"As Commissioner Barrot confirmed when he asked Italy for details, we believe that these practices violate the fundamental principles which underpin Europe."
"This kind of action is compatible neither with the European Convention on Human Rights nor with Community law, particularly the Schengen Borders Code and the Repatriation Directive, nor with Italian law."
"Yesterday, the United Nations called on Italy to comply with international law and, also yesterday, 24 Somali and Eritrean refugees turned away by Italy lodged an appeal against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for violating the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, illegal immigration in Italy has become a criminal offence, an aggravating circumstance."
"The mere fact of being a migrant entails discrimination and inequality, and gives rise to harsher punishments for the same crime."
"The fact of being an illegal migrant, as were the families of our Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Greek and Italian communities, blocks access to fundamental rights and to the most basic care, including health services, for fear of being reported."
"This is happening in Italy, Mr President, and has also been denounced by legal and constitutional experts and secular and Catholic associations."
"What does the Commission intend to do to end these violations?"
"Parliament has always supported the fight against illegal immigration, but only in compliance with fundamental rights."
"We would like to know, Mr President, whether the Commission intends to take action on Italian legislation and examine the Italy-Libya agreement."
"Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, reality goes beyond anything said in this House."
"We see President Gaddafi entertaining this issue and the international media constantly reporting that EUR 1 billion is needed if it is to honour its obligations."
"We see Turkey - a state which wants to accede to the European Union - turning back Frontex aircraft on a daily basis and the European Union failing to react as it should."
"We see traffickers who move illegal immigrants giving them instructions on how to shoot themselves in the arm or leg in the event of arrest, so that the Member States are obliged to adopt and apply a different type of legislation to that which governs illegal immigration, because they are now injured persons."
"We see traffickers giving illegal immigrants instructions to destroy their papers before they enter a country, so that host countries such as Greece have no idea where to send them; we see immigrants claiming that they are seeking asylum, but have no papers so that we can establish the facts."
"Chaos prevails, Commissioner, and order needs to be restored at some point with a strict and firm stand on the part of the European Union on this issue."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, we hear it said repeatedly that the Member States acknowledge the need to establish common immigration management policies at European level and policies aimed at the social integration of immigrants."
"However, as we see every day, the reality is far removed from that."
"For example, within the context of the budgetary discussions, the Fund for the integration of migrants has seen a drastic reduction in its resources."
"As for the Member States, many of them continue unilaterally to impose strict legislation and regulations on movement to and on their territory, to restrict access to their labour markets, social systems and educational systems, and to make family reunification difficult."
"In the same way, European policy on the fight against illegal immigration and on external border control ultimately amounts to passing the responsibility for border control on to our neighbours, in defiance of human rights."
"We have seen this happen between Italy and Libya."
"This tendency to externalise issues ultimately allows Europe to free itself from its responsibilities."
"This is unacceptable."
"The additional resources given to Frontex will never be a substitute for the necessary solidarity that must unite the Member States, enabling them to act together in accommodating people who need international protection, and in accommodating a foreign labour force that is needed to meet the democratic challenges of the future."
"What provisions are you making to ensure real solidarity and real solutions to the suffering of migrants?"
"(IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, Mr Billström, ladies and gentlemen, in recent days, when setting out the European asylum plan, you yourself, Mr Barrot, talked of steadfastness in the fight against illegal immigration and of humanity when receiving the victims of persecution."
"Translated into legal terms, this means ensuring protection and the right to asylum for those fleeing starvation, war and persecution, and preventing their expulsion to countries where their lives are in danger or they risk inhumane treatment."
"This is basically the opposite of what the Italian Government is doing, as demonstrated by the latest worrying refoulement of 75 immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia to Libya, which happened without at least checking whether there were any potential asylum seekers, as required by international law and as denounced yesterday by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"An agreement between Italy and Libya cannot transform that stretch of the sea into a free zone where human rights are violated."
"I therefore call on the Commission to take action as soon as possible to ensure that the rules of international law are restored and complied with."
"Furthermore, I would like to know what progress has been made in the negotiations on the bilateral agreement between the EU and Libya, already underway for a number of years."
"When do you expect to conclude it?"
"Can the Council and the Commission confirm that this agreement would prevail over the Italy-Libya one?"
"Can you explain to Parliament the key points relating to tackling illegal immigration and guaranteeing the right to asylum and the principle of non-refoulement?"
"Mr President, it is a great joy for me to take the floor for the first time in this Plenary to commend Minister Tobias Billström for his deep understanding - and, as an Italian national originally, I am in a position to say that - of the grave situation facing the Mediterranean people and countries."
"I would like to welcome his efforts to reach a consensus for a common European migration policy, which is very much needed."
"I would also like to welcome his initiative for the asylum support officer, which is a very practical and concrete way to support Member States who feel burdened and to start cooperation among Member States."
"I would like to ask Minister Billström if, other than the measures he has already talked about, he could maybe elaborate further, from a long-term point of view, about what measures we can take to support the Mediterranean countries and people, with his approach, which balances humanity, solidarity and firmness against any form of illegality."
"(EL) Mr President, without doubt, we need a common immigration policy and we need to reinforce our cooperation with third countries and make it more cohesive and effective."
"Within this cooperation, as the debate has illustrated, Libya and Turkey have prime position."
"Turkey's conduct is provocative."
"They are repeatedly obstructive and I want to make that known in the House and to send Mr Barrot the message that they are obstructing Frontex helicopters and aircraft when they are on European missions and on European duties."
"The New Democracy MEPs have exercised parliamentary scrutiny. Mr Barrot, you will receive detailed notice of these cases of provocation and of Turkey's provocative conduct."
"As for readmission and relocation, we must reinforce Frontex still further and organise joint return flights."
"Mr Barrot, Mr President, please hurry up and visit Turkey and Libya."
"The problem is very acute."
"Do not leave it until the end of the year."
"Today or tomorrow ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, border officials of European states are forbidden to turn away potential asylum seekers who arrive by sea or to escort them away, prevent them from travelling further or return them to countries which do not form part of the EU."
"This is laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Today, we have once again heard numerous examples of how Frontex does not comply with these rules in practice."
"For this reason, we need controls in this area."
"We need these controls as Members of the European Parliament, because it is our responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights are observed."
"My question to you is as follows: To what extent are we able to monitor whether border officials in international waters are complying with these legal requirements relating to human rights?"
"For years we have been aware that Frontex has violated human rights in individual cases."
"However, in all its activities, it is also seriously undermining the credibility of the EU when it comes to the protection of human rights."
"(SV) Mr President, thank you Mr Billström."
"I wonder if, at times, we do not become a little too fixated on the words 'illegal immigration'."
"After all, it cannot be illegal to flee for your life, since human rights and freedoms apply to everyone, wherever they live."
"I would like to emphasise that it is also vital to find out what conditions are like in the countries that people are fleeing from."
"Perhaps the EU could be more active and do more in those countries so that people do not need to flee only to subsequently be labelled illegal immigrants."
"Perhaps, as I said before, we are too fixated on the word 'illegal'."
"As I say, it is perfectly legal to stand up for human rights and freedoms both inside and outside the EU."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning it was almost like being at the Italian Parliament with you in the chair."
"In any case, I believe that immigration means security and respect for human rights."
"Unfortunately though, globalisation and the enlargement of the European Union to 27 countries have happened in too much of a rush without taking the appropriate steps to safeguard security and respect for human rights."
"I listened to the Commission: the strategy is sound and the future action is excellent, but we are forgetting that the issue is pressing and dramatic and that we have an emergency situation."
"What was said this morning holds true in a normal situation, but today - especially in Italy - the situation is not normal."
"I therefore urge the Commission to pay more attention to the tactics than to the strategy and to view the problem as entirely European. Thank you."
"The president in the chair right now is certainly Italian, but the debate was far from being purely Italian."
"Fortunately it was, shall we say, wide-ranging and enjoyed contributions from various quarters and different viewpoints from within the European Union."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you all for a very interesting debate."
"A lot of valuable opinions have been expressed here today."
"I would like to mention Mr Busuttil's views on greater cooperation with Libya."
"I hope to be able to visit Libya along with Commissioner Barrot in order to build relations with this country, and the work with Turkey will also continue."
"I also agree with Mr Aguilar, Chairman of the Committee on Civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, that one way to tackle illegal immigration is to open the way for legal immigration."
"That would relieve the pressure on the asylum system, for example."
"The criminal networks that exploit people's desperation must be tackled."
"The Swedish Presidency will organise a special conference in Brussels on this issue and the fight against human trafficking."
"It is the absolute priority of the Swedish Presidency to try to reach agreement regarding the European Asylum Support Office and to improve practical cooperation."
"Naturally, we are hoping for the support of the European Parliament in this matter."
"I would like to say to Mrs Alfano that it is important that the legal acts adopted by the European Council are complied with and that all Member States implement them as decided."
"It is also important to involve the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in our work in order to achieve the high quality that we are aiming for."
"I must also say that I agree with Mr Kirkhope's assessment of the importance of distinguishing between asylum and the immigration of workers."
"This reasoning leads us, naturally, to the conclusion that the EU needs a common European asylum system and also better opportunities for the legal immigration of workers based on national needs, legal certainty and protection against wage dumping and social exploitation."
"If we have this we will not need the policies of Messrs Meyer, Batten or Bontes."
"We need a sensible and well thought-out migration policy to improve the demographic structure of the EU and to strengthen the economy and people's welfare."
"Mrs Corazza Bildt and Mr Svensson addressed the issue of how we should deal with the mortalities in the Mediterranean."
"There is no single solution to the migration problem."
"It requires a package of various initiatives within different areas."
"Increased cooperation with the countries of origin and transit is particularly important."
"For example, development cooperation with these countries needs to increase in order to create stability, security and sustainability."
"The countries of origin and transit and the Member States must also improve their sea rescue."
"The division of responsibility between the countries with regard to sea rescue efforts also needs to be clarified."
"We also need to arrive at a common interpretation of the sea rescue regulations in terms of the right to international protection, on the one hand, and the international law of the sea, on the other."
"Finally, on behalf of myself and the Presidency, I would like to thank you very much for the opportunity to come here to the European Parliament to present our views."
"It is important to emphasise that our strategy must be based on multiple elements and initiatives."
"I think that this debate has clearly shown that. Thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this debate has demonstrated, if demonstration were needed, the scale of these migration problems."
"I would point out that our approach must be balanced between the rejection of illegal immigration, which, I might add, is often attributable to smugglers and traffickers; the desire, in respect of this fight against illegal immigration, to promote a certain kind of legal migration, a decision which rests with the Member States; and also the desire to preserve, in any case, the duty of asylum."
"First of all, I should like to respond very briefly on the Frontex issue, and to point out that we are preparing a proposal amending the regulation on Frontex and its working methods."
"I have certainly noted the desire for greater transparency that has been expressed."
"On the other hand, we are also going to try to clarify the rules that should help to ensure that Community law and international law are applied consistently within the context of Frontex operations."
"With regard to the Italian problems, I must say that, in July, we sent a letter to the Italian authorities requesting any useful information on the return of the boats intercepted in international waters."
"We have just received a reply from the Italian authorities, which our services are now examining in great detail."
"I would add that Community legislation demands that the Member States conduct border control operations in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement."
"This principle means that a State must refrain from returning people to a territory in which they could run the risk of being subjected to torture, punishments, or inhumane or degrading treatment."
"In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, return cannot take place where their lives and freedom may be threatened on the grounds of their race, religion or nationality."
"In short, we are ensuring that this duty of protection is upheld."
"Finally, I should like to reiterate our desire, with Mr Billström, to engage with Libya, on the one hand, and with Turkey, on the other, in a real dialogue that will allow us to get to the bottom of matters, to be able to cooperate on border control in order to prevent illegal migration, but also to see how, with the support of the High Commissioner for Refugees, we can try to initiate procedures in these Mediterranean countries that will mean that genuine asylum seekers do not have to resort to smugglers or traffickers in order to reach European shores and will see their asylum applications processed in those countries."
"This, then, is a major dialogue that is going to take up this last quarter."
"I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for its willingness to cooperate so effectively."
"To conclude, I should like to reiterate that we need a European strategy on migratory movements."
"We feel that the Member States really must show more of this solidarity with each other."
"The Member States are affected by the same problems."
"It must be said that illegal immigration ultimately affects all the Member States, not just those on the outer borders."
"I consider it truly important to establish this solidarity."
"We are proposing that this be done on a voluntary basis, but this voluntary basis will, without doubt, have to be formalised as a genuine response to the problems."
"There you have it;"
"I am not going to prolong these answers."
"I have taken many notes during the various speeches that have been made."
"I should like to finish with a somewhat urgent appeal to the European Parliament to help us, in particular, regarding this strategy, this European asylum policy."
"I would point out - since the matter has been raised - that we wished to improve the application of the Dublin agreement by allowing some flexibility."
"We have sought permission from the Council and Parliament to set up this support office by the end of the year, and we are also going to prepare for the harmonisation of the instruction procedures."
"All of this makes for a real European asylum policy that I feel is entirely consistent with the values on which, in my view, there is consensus in Europe."
"We believe in these values."
"They must be translated into action."
"I am grateful, in any case, to the European Parliament for helping us in this difficult task."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Illegal immigration is a veritable scourge which has afflicted mainly the southern countries of the EU, particularly Italy, Malta and Spain, for several years."
"It is well known that among all the EU Member States, it is the Italian Government which receives the highest number of illegal immigrants, desperate people principally from Africa, in search of a better future."
"Contrary to the claims made by exponents of the Italian left who, for the umpteenth time, have made improper use of the European Parliament to launch unjustified attacks against the Italian Government led by Mr Berlusconi, the preliminary reception centres provide medical care, board and lodging as well as legal aid for as long as is it takes to determine whether an illegal immigrant may remain in Italy or whether, in accordance with international agreements, he or she must be repatriated."
"We urgently need to adopt effective Community measures on immigration and asylum."
"We cannot seriously imagine that Italy is able to shoulder all the burdens associated with a phenomenon set to increase exponentially."
"Some Members have voiced the idea of establishing 'illegal immigrant quotas'."
"This is a case of good intentions sadly not backed by concrete political will: only recently, the Swedish Presidency highlighted the difficulty of gaining acceptance for these quotas."
"in writing. - I welcome this debate, which brings attention to the fragmented and inconsistent EU policies on border control, immigration and asylum seekers."
"I am glad to hear that the Council and Commission recognise these as priority issues, but so far we have seen only half-measures to address them and no meaningful results."
"It seems that there is a lack of political will on an EU level to provide adequate resources to tackle these issues in a fair manner."
"For the moment, Member States with external borders are carrying most of the burden and their situation is worsening by the day due to a lack of resources and capacity."
"Some good proposals have been discussed lately, such as the revision of the FRONTEX mandate, an EU-wide refugee resettlement scheme and the creation of a European asylum support office."
"I urge the Commission to act quickly on their implementation."
"We need more solutions based on a burden-sharing approach as it is the only adequate response."
"The Commission and Council must show more resolve in providing the necessary funding for FRONTEX."
"To protect our borders effectively, it should have its own equipment and assets, and operate on a year round basis."
"The future extension of the Schengen area to include Romania will increase the importance of ensuring the security of Romania's external borders and, therefore, the role of the FRONTEX agency in Romania."
"The FRONTEX agency must play an ever-increasing role in the process of improving the monitoring and control of Romania's external borders, representing more than 2 000 km of the EU's external frontier, in other words, the Schengen area's future external border."
"During the last year, FRONTEX has signed cooperation agreements with Russia and the countries in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, as well as with Ukraine and Moldova."
"This is a step forward towards managing all borders."
"One welcome measure, at this point, would be for the European Commission to examine the ways in which FRONTEX could utilise this legal basis."
"The possibility of signing cooperation agreements with other third countries is another matter which the Commission must explore."
"Obtaining as many agreements of this kind as possible will facilitate the effective coordination of joint operations and, consequently, contribute to the respect for human rights and civil liberties and to the fight against cross-border crime."
"I agree with Mr Buzek's statement that immigration has always benefited Europe, insofar as this relates to immigration that is regulated, integrated and respects the institutions and laws of the country of destination."
"When social renewal and labour turnover are needed, when cultural exchange enriches peoples, then immigration is a precious resource."
"Our Judeo-Christian roots provide us with the notion of charity and hospitality towards those who are suffering."
"However, when illegal immigration results in emergency situations, hardship, crime and insecurity, a tangible strategy for integration at levels that countries can sustain in demographic terms becomes necessary."
"We are fooling ourselves if we believe that the problem is limited to the countries bordering the Mediterranean: the free movement of citizens in the EU can only encourage the free movement of many illegal immigrants who have turned to crime."
"Every European state has a moral and direct interest since this is related to the issue of crime and the security of the half a billion citizens who have given us a mandate to protect them with urgent, tangible actions, both with regard to existing problems and those which are likely to develop rapidly."
"The rights of citizens cannot be traded for the general indifference of the Member States or for Solonic warnings by the European Commission."

"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - As a result of judgments by the Court of Justice in the Open Skies cases, the Commission allowed for the replacement of bilateral agreements that had been entered into between some Member States and third countries with Community agreements."
"The Commission has therefore negotiated an agreement that will replace the bilateral agreements between Mongolia and certain EU Member States."
"This proposal is aimed at replacing certain provisions of bilateral air service agreements concluded in the past by EU Member States and the Government of Mongolia, and deals with aspects that I consider crucial, including technical issues, taxation of fuel, and pricing."
"I particularly welcome the importance granted to compliance with Community competition law, since some provisions in earlier bilateral agreements were clearly anti-competitive."
"I therefore endorse Mr Simpson's report since it follows these general guidelines."
"in writing. - When Romania and Bulgaria entered the EU, it was specified in their act of accession that a protocol would have to be drawn up amending the Agreement on Maritime Transport between the EU and its Member States and China."
"This vote is in favour of the conclusion of this protocol."
"I voted in favour of the report on mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of France because I believe this fund helps countries to respond effectively and flexibly to situations created by natural disasters, in this case the storm last January which affected south-western France, causing severe damage."
"This financial instrument of solidarity is mobilised in cases where the damage caused by a disaster is so severe that national resources are insufficient to respond effectively to the crisis, the aim being to stimulate economic recovery and meet the needs of the Member State affected."
"I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend, Mr Böge, calling on the European Parliament to approve the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund to provide approximately EUR 109 million in commitment and payment appropriations in 2009 to help France, the victim of a disaster caused by storm Klaus which, in January 2009, hit 31 departments in the south-west of the country, causing an estimated EUR 4 billion or so of serious damage."
"I will take advantage of this speech to congratulate Mr Lamassoure, the chairman of our Parliament's Committee on Budgets, on the speed with which he, together with the European Commission's services, has dealt with this matter."
"in writing. - In January 2009, a storm took place in south-west France causing severe damage and enabling France to apply for funds from the European Union Solidarity Fund."
"I voted in favour of the mobilisation of these funds."
"In my view, solidarity among Member States in the European Union and, in particular, European support for countries affected by disasters, are a clear sign that the EU is no longer just a free trade area."
"By adopting special aid instruments like the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Community that we seek to make 'united in diversity' demonstrates its ability to remain united in adversity, even in situations that place high demands on human and material resources."
"That is something I sincerely welcome."
"I hope the Solidarity Fund is not used very often, as it will mean that Europe is not suffering from many serious emergencies, but I also hope that its structure and availability are increasingly improved and frequently reassessed so that it can meet any real demands swiftly and without red tape."
"I must mention the fires that have ravaged my country, particularly in 2003, and I acknowledge how important and useful mechanisms like this fund have been."
"I believe the particularly serious times that France went through in January this year justify mobilisation of the fund."
"The overwhelmingly positive vote in the Committee on Budgets confirms that this is a good measure."
"I welcome the intervention of the European Union Solidarity Fund - from which France will benefit - to help right the damage caused by the storm of January 2009, which hit the European and French forestry sector hard."
"The amounts granted should be available by October 2009; in other words, nine months after the storm."
"This intervention is quicker than the average time taken for the Fund to intervene, which is around one year from the time of the disaster to the payment of aid."
"While it is right to welcome this progress, it is worth continuing to call for the fund to be made available more quickly."
"The current procedure for managing the Solidarity Fund makes this difficult."
"Nonetheless, a revised proposal for a regulation was tabled by the European Commission and supported by a large majority of Parliament in May 2006."
"I regret that the Council has still not taken up this matter and I would encourage it now to consider, as soon as possible, the possibility of bringing the European Union Solidarity Fund into operation more quickly."
"I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend, Mr Böge, calling on the European Parliament to approve the proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) to provide EUR 4.1 million in commitment and payment appropriations to help the Spanish and Portuguese textile sectors (Catalonia and Norte-Centro regions)."
"The aim is to provide aid for the workers affected by the consequences of the significant changes in the structure of international trade and to help them re-enter the labour market."
"I share my colleagues' view about speeding up mobilisation of this fund and about assessing its complementarity with other existing instruments such as the Social Fund."
"I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to provide additional support to Portuguese workers affected by redundancies in the textile sector and who suffer the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"The mobilisation of EUR 832 800 from the fund is aimed at reintegrating workers into the labour market by means of personal employment plans, drawn up together with the workers, which include personal skill development and strategies for entering the labour market."
"EU support, particularly from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, is fundamental in helping those who have lost their jobs due to the relocations that have occurred in a globalised market."
"In recent years, especially as a result of the world economic crisis, Portugal has been feeling the effects of the problem of how to reabsorb and reintegrate the unemployed into the labour market."
"Countless firms have relocated to take advantage of the lower labour costs found in China and India, for example, with dire consequences for the entire national economy."
"The approval of EGF money to help these workers is vital not only for improving their personal and family situations, but also for the whole national economy, because the aim of these exceptional measures in the longer term is to help these workers to find and keep a new job."
"I voted in favour because I believe this support is important for Portuguese workers."
"I feel, however, that Portugal's application was not ambitious enough."
"The Portuguese Government asked the EGF for EUR 833 for each worker made redundant in the textile sector, whereas Spain applied for EUR 3 006 per worker in the same sector."
"I also find it somewhat surprising that, in the midst of an economic crisis with rising unemployment, in which the effects of globalisation can be felt, the EGF has received and accepted so few applications from the Member States."
"In fact, the EGF has EUR 500 million available for all the Member States this year, and to date only about EUR 60 million has been utilised."
"We voted in favour of this report, since the European Parliament is giving the green light for Portugal to receive EUR 832 800 to help workers made redundant in the textile industry in Portugal's Norte and Centro regions."
"This is a tiny sum, however, and it is merely a palliative measure, given the severe unemployment experienced in Portugal today, particularly in those regions."
"As we all know, Portugal applied to the European Commission for this money in January this year, and it relates to 1 588 redundancies reported between February and November 2008 in 49 textile companies in the northern and central regions of the country."
"Approval has also been given, however, for EUR 3 306 750 to support 1 720 workers dismissed from 30 textile companies in Cataluña, Spain."
"What was really needed, though, was a policy to support production, particularly in the textile sector, to prevent further company closures and further redundancies."
"While I agree with the basic principle, I believe that the seriousness of the crisis calls for provisions on an altogether different scale, not least to allow SMEs access to credit and to have credit that is conducive to employment, territorial development and the development of human capabilities."
"The motions submitted by Spain and Portugal to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) once again make clear the consequences of globalisation."
"In the countries of south-east Asia and, in particular, in the special economic zones, where people are exploited and employed without minimum social standards, textiles are being produced at dumping prices and then sold on the European market."
"European companies, which respect the social rights of employees that have been established and acquired over decades, are left at a disadvantage because of the higher costs that they incur as a result."
"We must stop this development from going any further immediately."
"A ban must be imposed as soon as possible on the import of products into the EU which are not produced under specific minimum social standards."
"Until this has been achieved, we can only work to reduce the damage caused by globalisation in the relevant countries."
"Therefore, I have voted without reservations in favour of releasing aid from the fund."
"In recognising the adverse impact of globalisation, which is all too evident in the industrial regions of Europe, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is grounded in the solidarity of the European project and brings it closer to the people by providing assistance for those workers who are worst affected by these changes."
"Portugal's Norte and Centro regions, where the economy was based on traditional sectors such as the textile industry, have been modernising since the early 1990s in an attempt to adapt to rapidly increasing competition."
"The textile industry employs roughly 15% of the labour force in these areas of the country, and almost 98% of the unemployment in the sector across the country is concentrated in these two regions."
"The worsening economic climate that has harmed these regions, along with others - particularly the outermost regions such as Madeira, where tourism is very important - has had worrying consequences in terms of social cohesion, above all, because of the rise in unemployment."
"I therefore support the mobilisation of EUR 832 800 from the EGF in the wake of the 1 588 redundancies in the textile industry in Portugal's Norte and Centro regions."
"This sum must be used wisely for retraining these workers and reincorporating them quickly and sustainably into the labour market."
"in writing. - This concerns the revision of Traditional Own Resources, VAT and GNI and provides for adjustments with reference to economic forecasts."
"The proposal is extremely technical, so I shall simply declare that my vote has been favourable to this proposal."
"in writing. - During January 2009, the south-west of France was hit by a storm which caused severe damage and therefore allows France access to funds in the EUSF."
"I am in favour of following the point of view of the rapporteur in accepting the proposed Draft amending budget No 7/2009."
"I consider it unacceptable to mix together in the same vote the appropriations to promote the bluetongue vaccination and the Europol and Eurojust appropriations."
"I am in favour of the appropriations to eradicate bluetongue disease, but am against the Europol and Eurojust appropriations."
"In January 2009, France was hit by a severe storm."
"Storm Klaus caused devastation, in particular to the country's infrastructure."
"The objective of the Solidarity Fund is to cover part of the cost of damage which has to be paid for out of the public purse."
"This case meets all the requirements."
"For this reason, and particularly for reasons of cross-border solidarity with the French citizens who were and, in some cases, still are affected by storm Klaus, I have voted in favour of the Draft amending budget."
"I welcome the adoption today of the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Haug, to which I gave my full support."
"With this vote, we are allowing the European Union Solidarity Fund to be mobilised for the second time this year."
"Indeed, having come to the aid of Romania, the European Union is now showing its solidarity with the French population which, in January 2009, felt the full force of the devastating and very violent storm Klaus, which was described as a 'major natural disaster' and, as such, was eligible for inclusion in the main scope of this Fund."
"In total, more than EUR 120 million have been made available in this way."
"As you know, this aid is sorely needed for the departments in the south-west of my country, which have suffered considerable damage."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members for voting in favour of this report."
"It will, of course, be necessary now to ensure that the French Government involves the local authorities fairly in the process and that these authorities are not cheated as regards the way in which this money is used."
"Indeed, it would be unacceptable if only the private sector were to benefit from it."
"in writing. - We acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, particularly for beef and sheep farmers in the South and East of England who, by wholesale vaccination on their own farms, have created a firewall against bluetongue that their fellow farmers in the North and West have benefited from."
"In order to vote for EU funding for this vaccine we are obliged (in the same vote) to vote for increased funding for Eurojust and Europol."
"These are two agencies that operate outside the boundaries acceptable to British law, severely increasing the power of the state at the expense of the liberty of the individual."
"It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts."
"Thus, we could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains our voting abstention on the subject."
"in writing. - This report concerned modifications in the budget creating fresh commitments amounting to EUR 51 640 000."
"These funds will go to the fighting of bluetongue, the creation of a high flux reactor in addition to funds directed to Europol and OLAF."
"My vote here is consistent with the opinion of the rapporteur."
"in writing. - I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, and deplore the refusal of the UK Government to assist its farming community on this important issue."
"This report contained provisions related to this situation. However, this report also contained provisions totally unrelated to farming, which would have had a disastrous impact on the UK."
"In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law."
"It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts."
"Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject."
"in writing. - I acknowledge the very real need for a bluetongue vaccine, and note the unhelpful attitude of the UK Government on this important issue."
"This report contained provisions related to this situation. However, this report also contained provisions totally unrelated to farming, which would have had a disastrous impact on the UK."
"In particular, this report called for funding to Eurojust and Europol, agencies that operate outside of the boundaries acceptable to British law."
"It is contemptible that the EU attempts to bury such provisions in these types of reports, and then requires MEPs to vote on them as a whole and not individual parts."
"Thus, I could not in good conscience support such a report, which explains my vote on the subject."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael members of the EPP Group voted in favour of Draft amending budget No 8/2009."
"We note that this vote includes the creation of a budget item to provide supplementary funding to the High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten, Netherlands."
"Originally, the facility was set up to evaluate materials used in fusion and fission reactors."
"It has become an indispensable facility for the production of radioisotopes for the medical sectors, covering some 60% of European demand."
"The report also provides support for, among other things, a strengthened budget to eradicate the bluetongue disease and assistance with European policing and anti-fraud."
"On balance, given the nature of the HFR and the mix of budget items covered, the Fine Gael delegation voted to support Draft amending budget No 8/2009."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the abovementioned report which includes an increase in loan commitments for programmes aiming at eradicating and tracking animal diseases as well as observing the physical well-being of animals which could present a threat to public health linked to external factors."
"At the same time, I would like to emphasise my disagreement with the other issues raised in the report, which should not have been included in this report:"
"The creation of budget item 10 04 04 02 (Operation of the high-flux reactor (HFR));"
"The creation of budget item 18 05 02 03 (European Police);"
"A reinforcement of the Community subsidy to EUROJUST;"
"Modifications to the establishment plan of OLAF, without additional financial provisions."
"The report on Draft amending budget No 8/2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009 includes some contradictory points."
"It focuses on the increase in resources to eradicate bluetongue disease in sheep, the pursuit of a research programme on the use of a nuclear reactor installed in the Netherlands, the Europol and Eurojust programmes, and OLAF."
"In voting against this draft report, I obviously did not wish to take a stand against provisions that are vitally important to sheep farmers."
"I wished to take a stand against the ever-persistent use of nuclear power."
"Above all, I wished to reaffirm my commitment to combating the construction of a fortress, security-driven and ineffective Europe to ensure the safety of our fellow citizens, via the Europol and Eurojust budgets."
"There is a need to curb these policies which, in the name of the fight against insecurity and terrorism, are increasingly undermining the fundamental freedoms and rights of our fellow citizens, and to review and redefine the mandates of the various Community agencies and bodies involved in these policies."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 and resumed at 11.35)"
"Inaugural address by the President of the European Parliament"
"Presidents of the European Parliament, Ministers, Presidents and representatives of the European institutions, ladies and gentlemen, and above all, dear friends."
"I stand before you today as the thirteenth President of the directly-elected European Parliament. I am pleased to see a number of former Presidents here among us today: Mr Emilio Colombo, Mr Enrique Barón Crespo, Mr Egon Klepsch, Mr Klaus Hänsch, Mr José María Gil-Robles, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, Mr Pat Cox and Mr Hans-Gert Pöttering."
"(Applause)"
"Your presence is a great privilege for us all."
"As many of you have said, my election is also symbolic - symbolic of the dream of a united continent held by the citizens in our part of Europe, a dream that has now been fulfilled."
"My dear colleagues from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta, I know and understand the concerns, needs and expectations of those who recently joined the Union."
"I know, because in my country they are the same."
"However, now we bear a shared responsibility for the future of our continent."
"The old and new Europe are no more. This is our Europe!"
"We want it to be modern and strong. And we want our citizens to see it as such."
"This calls for energy and hard work."
"It is a goal that generations of Europeans have dreamed of and one worthy of the great effort needed to achieve it."
"I am ready to do that work and make that effort, because those dreams were also my dreams."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as we begin this new parliamentary term, Europe and we ourselves - its representatives - face many challenges. We must meet those challenges."
"We must remember that, in striving for a better Europe, the European Parliament plays a special role, a role that is not only institutional, but also social, a deeply symbolic role."
"The European Parliament is the essence of the European democratic system."
"It is the basis for the permanence and stability of that system, a guardian of the ideals and values embodied not only in our decisions and their effects, but also in our debates."
"However, the European Parliament has another task to fulfil - the task of creating a vision of a new Europe, a vision which extends beyond the present, beyond what Europe is towards what it should be."
"In order to create this vision together, we need imagination, knowledge, wisdom and, above all, courage."
"Hannah Arendt, a German philosopher of Jewish origin, said that politics is the only area of life, except for religion, where miracles happen."
"Exactly 20 years ago, we in Europe witnessed such a miracle and that is why we believe in the power of courage, imagination and wisdom."
"I think that all of us here today share that belief."
"(Applause)"
"I view the challenges that face us with optimism."
"For me, the important challenges before us are: firstly, the economic crisis and European solidarity; secondly, energy and the environment; thirdly, foreign policy; fourthly, human rights and our system of values; and fifthly, our Parliament and how to reform it."
"The most painful and most difficult question facing us is the economic crisis."
"We must overcome it and we will overcome it."
"Europe took the lead in proposing solutions to the G8 and G20 summits, solutions which, while preserving our social model, can help the world put its economy to rights."
"In the face of globalisation, Europe must speak with one voice."
"Now more than ever, in this time of crisis, we must focus on economic growth and fighting unemployment. We must breathe fresh life into the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy and find ways of investing in new technologies, innovation, education and human resources."
"The Community budget has an important role to play in ensuring that European research programmes have clear priorities and procedures."
"Under the new Treaty, Parliament and the Council will enjoy equal budgetary powers."
"The codecision procedure will include agriculture, fisheries, external trade, and justice and home affairs, while also giving us equal responsibilities in the area of agricultural spending."
"We must guard against the temptation of protectionism and the renationalisation of common policies."
"The cohesion policy must remain a priority in the next Community budget if we wish to achieve full integration of our reunited continent."
"The single market is our great achievement. We must protect it and consolidate it to ensure that Europe remains competitive."
"This means that European integration must be strengthened, not weakened."
"Let us have the courage of our convictions."
"If we are to revitalise, understand and live in the Community we are building, two things are essential: solidarity and social cohesion."
"There can be no true community without concern for everyone, especially the most vulnerable - the unemployed, the least educated, those living in remote regions."
"Fighting unemployment is the main aim of the Swedish Presidency."
"We shall assist them vigorously in that task."
"Behind the Iron Curtain, the cry in the streets was once: 'There can be no freedom without solidarity'."
"Now we can say: 'Without solidarity there can be no community.'"
"(Applause)"
"We cannot overcome the economic crisis without making use of the vast intellectual, economic and creative potential of women."
"The demographic crisis calls for a strengthening of family and fertility."
"We must also ensure that women do not have to sacrifice their careers for their family and to bring up children."
"(Applause)"
"In order to overcome the demographic crisis, while standing by our democratic principles, we must also be an open community."
"Immigration has always brought Europe benefits."
"We must propose solutions that will enable us to invite immigrants and create the conditions for their integration, while also expecting them to be open to such integration."
"We are facing an energy crisis."
"Europeans may not understand geopolitics, but they understand if their heating is turned off."
"We must continue to diversify our energy resources and step up investment in renewable energy sources and fossil fuels."
"Nuclear power is available to us and this is a matter for Member States to decide."
"We must extend the external pipeline network so as not to be dependent on any particular country."
"We need to increase the interconnections between our gas and electricity networks. We must also consider the possibility of purchasing gas jointly, so as to establish a genuine European energy market based on solidarity."
"I believe that the time has come for the Union to have a real common energy policy and I will strive to achieve that."
"(Applause)"
"Energy also prompted the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, the seed from which our Community sprang."
"At that time, Robert Schuman said: 'The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war ... becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible'."
"This was the original idea behind that Community."
"Our energy policy must take into account the environmental threats linked to climate change."
"We need a green revolution and we must curb our own excesses."
"The European Parliament is spearheading the debate on this subject."
"Together with many of you, I worked on the Temporary Committee on Climate Change."
"You know where I stand and you know that I will work with you to reach a compromise in Copenhagen."
"Parliament is an important actor on the international stage. This is what our citizens expect of us."
"Europe must be more present not only within the borders of the European Union, but also worldwide."
"Developing a coherent and effective foreign policy which includes a vision of the global order must be one of the great challenges during this Parliament."
"Jean Monnet once said that everyone has ambition."
"The question is whether you use that ambition to become someone, or rather to achieve something."
"During this Parliament, let us have the ambition to achieve something."
"So what are the most important goals?"
"First: an active policy towards the European Union's neighbours in the south and east."
"With this in view, we should continue our work in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and take action within the framework of the Euronest Assembly."
"Second: we should promote democracy and models of good governance."
"We should use the interparliamentary assemblies and our delegations to hold parliamentary summits in advance of the Union's bilateral summits."
"This is important, because the European Parliament will be involved in decisions on a greater number of policies."
"EUROLAT is a good example of this kind of cooperation."
"Third: it is time we had a genuine transatlantic parliamentary partnership, building together a new framework for the world order."
"I shall strive to forge closer ties with the United States Congress at all levels."
"Fourth: we must work on our strategic partnership with Russia, while not forgetting that, as in our relations with China, economic and political considerations cannot take precedence over human rights, the rule of law and democracy."
"(Applause)"
"As President of this Parliament, I shall engage fully in dialogue with our Russian partners, notably in the context of the new Baltic strategy."
"Fifth: we must strengthen our relations with India and other emerging powers such as Brazil and the Republic of South Africa."
"India must be both an economic and a political partner."
"Sixth: the Middle East remains the key to global stability."
"Europe must play an active role in this region."
"Seventh: enlargement has been one of our most successful political strategies."
"Did any of our European forebears ever enjoy such a long period of peace and prosperity as we now have?"
"At present, Croatia, and perhaps Iceland, appear to be the countries closest to accession."
"Eighth: the European Union is the world's biggest aid donor."
"We must examine where we stand with current and potential beneficiaries and not forget our obligations towards them under the Millennium Development Goals."
"We may close our doors to some who would come here, but let us not close our hearts and let us do what we can to bring life in their home countries closer to the standards we enjoy in Europe."
"Ninth: we must strengthen the Union's missions under the European security and defence policy."
"There have been 22 such missions over the past six years and they should enjoy a clear mandate and the resources needed to do their job."
"The European Parliament wants to ensure closer control and monitoring of these missions."
"The wider budgetary powers Parliament will enjoy under the Treaty of Lisbon may improve our flexibility when it comes to allocating resources to the essential missions we support."
"The implementation of the new Treaty must be our priority for the immediate future."
"I am committed to preparing Parliament to function in accordance with the new provisions as soon as the Treaty comes into force."
"Yet, regardless of the Treaty, we feel the need for change."
"We feel the need for a more dynamic parliamentary dimension within our institution."
"As President of Parliament, I want to draw on the vital work on parliamentary reform begun in recent years by my predecessors. But we must go further down that road."
"I shall do all I can to make more room for creative political debate within our Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"I firmly support making greater use of the 'catch-the-eye' system for speakers, as a way of enlivening our plenary debates, and use will be made of this system after my speech."
"This is particularly important in guaranteeing minority rights."
"The most important missing link in the reform process is the improvement of relations with the other European Union institutions - the Commission and Council."
"A significant part of my term of office will be devoted to this."
"As President, I shall seek to develop a new model of partnership with the Commission so as to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny of the executive and make the executive branch more accountable to this House, as the Treaty of Lisbon directs."
"In July, I invited the Commission President to take part in a question time to be held each month in Parliament, during which Members would be able to ask questions from the floor."
"I propose that we introduce such a practice as soon as possible."
"(Applause)"
"Two weeks ago, President Barroso forwarded to us his 'political guidelines' for a second term."
"This is a significant innovation, since it marks an acceptance of the fact that it is the European Parliament which elects the Commission President."
"I take great satisfaction in this."
"I have also encouraged the parliamentary committees to examine legislation still in the pipeline and to determine whether the new Commission intends to abandon, amend or maintain its legislative proposals."
"I am also encouraging the committees to hold serious discussions on future political strategy so as to ensure that the hearings of Commissioners-designate are based on a detailed legislative programme and not just on an assessment of their CVs and professional experience."
"We must forge closer relations with the Council of Ministers."
"If these relations are to be credible, they must reflect the fact that in today's European Union, Parliament is a true co-legislator."
"We must also work together on the institutional questions arising from the Treaty of Lisbon."
"These concern the extension of the codecision procedure, the new comitology system, the appointment of the new High Representative and Commission Vice-President, democratic control over the new external action service and the question of how to deal with the 'dual Council Presidency' during plenary sittings."
"Our relations with the 27 national parliaments of the European Union must be developed in the same spirit."
"In recent years, cooperation has been on the increase and the Treaty of Lisbon will further strengthen these contacts and enhance their role in making citizen-friendly laws."
"A fine example of this cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments is the Stockholm Programme, with its focus on justice and public security."
"I want to push ahead with reforms in the use of Parliament's human resources and expenditure, so that they are focused directly on our programmes."
"The richness and strength of our institution also derive from our differences - different nationalities, different ways of thinking and different languages."
"That is why Members must be able to speak in their mother tongue, if they so wish, so that they can properly represent their voters."
"We must always remember that the Union is not only about the challenges of the future and a vision of ever-increasing prosperity and stability."
"It is, above all, about human rights."
"I have noted with concern the tensions in relations between Slovakia and Hungary over national minorities."
"This remains a major problem, and I should like to offer my assistance in resolving this dispute in accordance with the values in which we firmly believe and which reflect the convictions of our Parliament."
"(Loud applause)"
"A good example of how we uphold these values is the Sakharov Prize awarded to human rights defenders, who now form the basis of a 'Sakharov network', something which I intend to develop further."
"I should also like to press ahead with the project for a House of European History begun by my predecessor, who is present today, and who is still a Member of the European Parliament, which is something we are very pleased about."
"I should also like us to remember once again here in this House that the Union is a community of ideals and values."
"This is the foundation on which it was built."
"I am determined to take measures to ensure that all committees and delegations have access to satellite television and the Internet."
"We need to look at the way in which European elections are organised."
"For example, we should insist on the use of new technologies during elections in order to boost turnout."
"It is also time to open a debate on European political parties."
"Citizens must know what they are voting for - not only in their own countries, but also at European level."
"I attach great importance to cooperation with the Conference of Presidents."
"Together, we will take responsibility for the work of this House, along with the 14 Vice-presidents, whom I thank for their expressions of support."
"I also appreciate the spirit of partnership shown by the chairmen of our parliamentary committees."
"I should like the chairmen of the standing interparliamentary delegations to be able to exert a significant influence over the Union's foreign policy."
"Matters relating to Parliament's budget will be addressed with the help of the Quaestors."
"Most of all, however, my dear colleagues, I am counting on your cooperation."
"As President of the European Parliament, I know that I am responsible for providing you with good working conditions, but I would strongly urge you all to share this burden."
"For most of us, the Treaty of Lisbon represents a long-awaited institutional solution."
"It will improve the Union's ability to resolve existing problems and will bring the European institutions closer to our citizens."
"The late Bronisław Geremek, in whose honour we have named the main courtyard of the Strasbourg Parliament, was fond of saying that European integration was like riding a bicycle: you have to keep pedalling to maintain your balance and to keep going in the right direction."
"This illustrates precisely why ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon is so necessary for us."
"(Applause)"
"Less than a week ago, I was present in the Polish Parliament to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the first non-communist government in our part of Europe, under the leadership of Tadeusz Mazowiecki."
"It was a particularly moving anniversary, because it marked the beginning of the rapid collapse of the totalitarian system in other Central European countries."
"It was this first breach which made it possible to bring down the wall dividing Europe."
"I am speaking to you here today in Strasbourg, the capital of a region whose fate is reminiscent of that of my own region, Silesia, a border region whose inhabitants have frequently had to change their nationality without changing where they lived."
"I solemnly pledge that, as President of Parliament over these coming years, I will serve as your ambassador, bringing the message of a reunited continent to the citizens of Europe and the world."
"Let us work together to find real and practical solutions to the great challenges now facing Europe and the world."
"Let us work to make our dreams come true."
"Let us set about this task with enthusiasm, wisdom and courage."
"Because this is our Europe. A modern Europe."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"Mr President, Presidents of the European institutions, Mr Buzek, my group fully subscribes to your programme for Parliament and the running of Parliament over the next five years."
"If the European Parliament has a role to play, a mission to accomplish, over the next five years, it is indeed to reconcile the citizens with Europe."
"And what better advantage in this task than to have as President a man who symbolises reunified Europe, a man such as yourself, Mr Buzek."
"That is why I would like to say how proud I am that it was my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that persuaded a very large majority of this Parliament to put their trust in you."
"This Europe, reunified today, is not about intolerance or exclusion, but about openness and respect for the opinions and the origins of others."
"I am convinced that this concept of living together as Europeans brings us all together in this House."
"What I would like is for the European Parliament, under your leadership, to have our fellow citizens share these values."
"I also support the determination that you have expressed, Mr President, to rise to this challenge, and I hope that we will make a particular effort in favour of young people."
"My group has no hesitation in helping you."
"Mr President, as you said, this Parliament has acquired powers and increased authority over the last few years."
"The prospect of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will increase this trend spectacularly."
"This is one of the reasons why the PPE Group is calling for its application as soon as possible."
"We must prepare ourselves for it technically, of course, so that we can work effectively with the Council and in close partnership with the Commission, but we must also and, above all, prepare ourselves for it politically."
"Our primary objective is clear: to ensure that Parliament is more in tune with the 500 million citizens that it represents."
"To do so, it must continue, in particular, to modernise its working methods, for example in the organisation of our debates - you alluded to this."
"In this regard, I support your proposal to have a lively topical debate with the President of the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the workings of the European Union are difficult to explain to Europeans."
"Far from the traditional 'opposition/majority' model to which we are accustomed in our Member States, we work here, I would stress, in search of a consensus, beyond the specific convictions of our political families."
"That, in my view, is a modern take on political action."
"I am convinced that our fellow citizens can accept this approach, but on one condition: that we take the trouble to explain to them better the issues at stake in Europe."
"That is the task that I encourage you, Mr President, to undertake and for which you will receive the full support of my group."
"Mr President, I endorse the comments made by Mr Daul."
"Mr Buzek, our group can also endorse many, if not all, of the points in the programme which you have presented."
"This applies to the content of your presentation, to the procedural updates that you have proposed and to the revitalisation of the debate in this House."
"The broad majority of the Members of this House will agree with the content of the speech that you have given."
"I do not fully share Mr Daul's opinion that you have laid down your programme for the next five years."
"Let us work on the basis of the next two-and-a-half years to start with, because that is a long time."
"However, I believe, Mr Buzek, that you are taking over your office at a difficult time for the European Union."
"You are also taking over your office at a difficult time for the European Parliament."
"For the first time in a long time, the pro-European consensus is no longer undisputed in this House."
"On the contrary, this House is, for the first time, a platform - this began in the last parliamentary term and has been reinforced by the most recent European elections - in which forces are at work and have gained attention and influence whose aim is exactly the opposite of what you have said in your speech."
"The number of Members of this assembly who want to bring an end to European integration, the number of Members who want to reverse it and the number of Members who want renationalisation has risen dramatically."
"In the previous parliamentary term, we experienced the process of attempting to have the Charter of Fundamental Rights signed by the three presidents of the institutions."
"I would not have believed images and scenes of this kind to be possible in a multinational, democratic parliament, but we all bore witness to what happened."
"The number of Members who hold opinions of this kind has increased."
"This is why I would say that you are right."
"The struggle to continue with and to deepen the integration process, the struggle for the Treaty of Lisbon, which is a fundamental requirement for the extension of the EU, and also the struggle to extend the EU on the basis of deeper integration, represent the right approach."
"I am pleased that the President of this House - especially a President from a country which joined the EU in the most recent phase of enlargement, a President who, as Prime Minister of his country, began the accession negotiations - says as the central message of his period of office: we want more Europe."
"We want an integrated Europe, we want a deeper Europe and we want an enlarged Europe as part of the deepening process, in order to achieve one thing, and this was the central sentence in your speech: the solidarity which has led to freedom."
"This is the solidarity which we now need internally, so that this freedom can be achieved together with social justice."
"For this reason, the socialists and social democrats fully agree with your speech, Mr Buzek."
"It forms the ideological and spiritual foundation of a struggle which we must take part in during this parliamentary term."
"When I was a newly elected Member, I had the privilege of hearing the speech made here by the French President François Mitterand in his role as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I have never forgotten one sentence in that speech: 'In the end, nationalism always means war.'"
"This means that in the end, the opposite of nationalism, overcoming nationalism, the European ideal, means peace."
"That is what we will be fighting to achieve together with you, Mr Buzek."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank you on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for your inaugural speech."
"Our group can fully identify with the programme you announced."
"As I told you at the time, Mr President, I welcome your election as President of Parliament, not only because you symbolise the enlargement of the European Union but also - and I should like to emphasise this - on account of your involvement with Solidarność."
"After all, Solidarność can look back on three great achievements."
"It gave people in Poland a vote, it introduced democracy to the entire former Eastern Bloc, and it even changed the face of Europe fundamentally, unifying a divided Europe."
"As was clear from your speech, Mr President, this gives you the perfect experience to realise three ambitions in the European Parliament, too, over the next few years. These ambitions are to give the European people more say, to make the European Union more democratic and also, in this way, to advance European integration."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it would be good to underline further to President Buzek's inaugural speech that, according to the Eurobarometer, the European Parliament is the European Union institution in which citizens have the most confidence."
"This represents a difficult task for us all, as it means that we cannot betray this confidence and that we must give the people's voice more influence in European decision making."
"At the same time - based on your speech, Mr President - I think that we face a dual challenge."
"Firstly, we must apply the Treaty of Lisbon and implement it as soon as possible."
"In this regard - as you have proposed - we must enter into negotiations with the Council Presidency as soon as possible in order to agree a number of amendments."
"Secondly, Mr President - and this is the other aspect of the challenge - I think that Parliament must avail itself of all the possible levers at its command to further expand its power."
"We have done this in the procedure for the appointment of the Commission President, but we must continue to do it on every possible point in other dossiers, too."
"In my view, the most important point in this connection is the need to agree a new budget for Europe and the European Union in the next few years."
"I consider this a splendid opportunity for the European Parliament to urge - to require - that, in future, this budget be based on the European Union's own resources, as this Parliament will not be a real parliament until it also has complete control over its own resources, which it will be able to collect itself in future."
"(Applause)"
"Herein lies an important task for you, Mr President: to join the whole of Parliament in this fight."
"In this, you will be able to count on the full support of our group, as we all know, particularly in these times of economic and financial crisis, that it is not nationalism or protectionism that will relieve our difficulties or secure our future; only continuing European integration represents a solution for the peoples of Europe, for the citizens of Europe."
"In any case, I wish you every success, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I do not need to go over much of what the previous speaker has said."
"It was clear to my group that we would support your candidacy, because we felt that it was high time that a major figure from the European Parliament, who also comes from one of the new Member States, took on the role of the head of this House."
"In future, we would like to see the President of this House being elected on the basis of considerations such as your special skills and abilities, which have often been acknowledged."
"We would also like to see the power of national delegations within the large groups perhaps being applied to a slightly lesser extent than the approach which figures like you adopt."
"We have great expectations of you when it comes to overcoming the major breaches which remain between East and West and which I described some weeks ago."
"Following the summer holidays and my observations of political developments, I would simply like to say that you are likely to have a very difficult task."
"My impression is that the major global financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis have not made the job of bringing East and West closer together within the EU any easier."
"On the contrary, the challenges have become greater because the imbalances represent a major problem."
"I would also like to take a slightly more critical approach and remind Parliament that today is the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers."
"We are sending a large delegation to the G20 summit where the subject of how the financial crisis can be overcome will be discussed."
"However, this Parliament has not managed to discuss any resolutions in this area and has not given our negotiators a uniform basis on which to work."
"I believe that this is an expression of weakness rather than strength."
"I suspect that what lies behind this is that we still cannot agree on the analysis of how we actually got into this mess."
"I believe that this major crisis is not solely the responsibility of a few crazy bankers, but that in fact, it is due to the neo-liberal belief in the benefits of unregulated financial markets, which not only was and is prevalent in the US, but also remains widespread in Europe today."
"In the policies of the European Union we are far from reaching a consensus on the evaluation of this analysis and, therefore, we are also unable to agree on the ways out of the crisis."
"I also believe, Mr President, that everything which you said about the second major challenge facing us in the context of an international round of negotiations, that is, the challenge of the climate crisis, was correct."
"I hope that we Europeans can take a stronger position in Copenhagen than is currently the case."
"I have the impression that the Europeans are still a long way from playing an appropriate leading role in the area of climate policy."
"There are many reasons for this, but one reason keeps coming to my mind."
"We continue to put far too little trust in concepts such as the Green New Deal put forward by Ban Ki-moon or Achim Steiner on behalf of the UN."
"We are also unable to agree that we should begin transforming our old industrial society, that we should think more than one day ahead and that climate-friendly technologies, efficiency technologies and many other measures represent the future, not only of Europe but also of the world."
"I can only say, Mr President, that we face major challenges."
"If you intend to put forward modern, sustainable ideas, our group will definitely be behind you."
"It is regrettable that we will not see a real change in the staffing of the European Commission because it is becoming apparent that the main player behind yesterday's concepts, Mr Barroso, will continue to head the Commission during the next parliamentary term."
"Mr President, we wish you luck!"
"On behalf of my group, I look forward to some exciting and, hopefully, productive debates."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it was a real pleasure today to listen to your speech and your programme for the next two and a half years of our work."
"Thank you very much for your speech."
"It testifies to your respect for us, Members of the European Parliament, a respect which does not depend on which political group or country we come from, or on what views we represent."
"It was a stimulating speech, because I think that our Parliament is truly in need of the kind of leadership which you have presented in your vision today."
"We do not agree about everything, and it is not a secret that there are differences of opinion between us, but I would like to begin with this, responding in some sense to the voices which I have also heard in this House today."
"It is not a bad thing that Parliament is a place of debate, and that Parliament is a meeting place for people who may have different views on different subjects, including different views on the future of Europe."
"The problem is that we should endeavour, in good faith, to confront our views with those of others - then there will always be room for compromise."
"If we assume - and I do assume - that everyone in this House has good intentions and wants the best for our continent, then we will be able to overcome differences, and we will always be open to discussion."
"What is needed is that good will."
"Of course, however, Mr President, our group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, a group which is proud that it brings to Parliament a certain new dimension to political thinking about Europe, is going to want to be a strong voice for those citizens who elected us."
"For while we do not negate the democratic mandate of any Member who sits in this House, indeed, we deeply respect that mandate, it is our voters whom we represent."
"Our voters, when they chose parties which are part of the ECR Group, knew what they were voting for."
"Mr President, your election was an historic moment."
"I will permit myself to remind our fellow Members and say that today in this House, there is a group of young Poles, invited by Members of different political groups."
"These Poles were born on 4 June, on the day of the first partially free elections held in our country."
"A meeting with people born on 4 June may not allow us to feel young any more, when we see that they are now adult people."
"However, I want to say that when I talked with them today, and I realised that they got on the bus in Rzeszów, a city in the south-east of Poland, and without having to stop at any borders, they came here to Strasbourg, to their Parliament, I thought that none of us who remember 4 June could imagine such felicitous events - today, young Poles, young Czechs, Estonians and Lithuanians come here to their Parliament."
"Mr President, I am certain that you will guard this Parliament as a democratic institution, as a place of genuine debate of people who sincerely want to help the citizens of the European Union."
"And today, when we recall that you too, Mr President, come from my country, a country which has suffered so much at the hands of totalitarianism, we know one thing - and this truly is the best thing about the EU - the European Union has ensured the nations of Europe 60 years without war."
"This is a great achievement of this organisation, an organisation which we, the ECR Group, do want to reform, as our name indicates, but it is an organisation which we believe in."
"We believe in a better Europe, and it is such a Europe, a better Europe, which is closer to its citizens, that we will serve during this parliamentary term."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate you on your election."
"Transparency, democracy and pluralism are honourable words for the EU and for Parliament, but they must never be turned into mere symbolic policies."
"Unfortunately, these terms sometimes become nothing more than fine words."
"In reality, agreements are made behind closed doors."
"We therefore need a different method of working in Parliament, one where our work and our decisions are brought into the open in a genuine spirit of true democracy."
"We need an open way of working that applies to all political groups and all Members of the House."
"If some MEPs do not even feel involved in and aware of the work, how can we expect our citizens to feel involved and have confidence in our work and to vote in elections?"
"Let us have new technology by all means - we need it to provide information - but we must not forget the most important ingredients for involvement."
"These are democracy and transparency."
"We are experiencing a financial crisis and an environmental and climate crisis."
"I should also mention that we have trade agreements which sometimes exacerbate the problems with regard to food supply and poverty in the world."
"The view of the left is that the solution to the crises is not to continue with the same policy that has sometimes been a contributory factor in creating them."
"The people of Europe need a different policy."
"They deserve a different policy - a policy that puts the needs of the people first and not, as is currently the case, the needs of the market."
"One way to start to move the policy in the right direction is to stop the privatisation and deregulation of public services."
"The market has not, in fact, succeeded when it comes to satisfying people's need for work and social rights, for example."
"We have to suffer the consequences of this."
"We talk about democracy."
"Democracy also requires that our civil rights and freedoms never be violated."
"We currently have many proposals for the additional monitoring of our citizens."
"Freedom of expression must also apply on the Internet."
"Thus, the EU and its citizens need a different policy for a fairer society with greater solidarity."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left are prepared, and gladly accept our responsibility, to play our part in building a fairer EU with greater solidarity and a fairer and better world."
"Mr President, I again extend my congratulations to you on your appointment."
"I welcomed your address, your programme, and wish to concentrate on an aspect which, in my opinion, is the most important or should be the most important for us MEPs, namely our legislative work."
"Dialogue with the major powers is important, missions are important, but the main task of a parliament - at least in my opinion - is to make laws, to establish rules, because, above all, we were elected to carry out this task, this mandate."
"One of the problems is that we do not have the right of legislative initiative, since the founding fathers and their successors denied it to us."
"We are continually voting for resolutions and signing written statements which are not followed up as the Commission does not take them into account."
"Mr Barroso said that this is only right as otherwise, if the Commission were to accept legislative proposals from Parliament through written declarations and resolutions, it would violate the treaties, which do not permit this."
"Allow me to say that I find this interpretation specious: the treaties do not provide for it explicitly, but neither do they prohibit it."
"I must point out that when Parliament asks for something, when Parliament asks for a legislative initiative, it does so on behalf of millions of European citizens, the majority of the millions of European citizens, since both written declarations and resolutions need majority support in order to be adopted."
"I am therefore sure that you, Mr President, will work hard to make the Commission accept that the proposals we MEPs put forward can become EU legislation, in accordance with the will of the people, our electors."
"It is an onerous task, but I am certain that you will make every effort to accomplish it."
"(FR) Mr President, as a non-attached Member I speak, of course, on my own behalf, but also on behalf of some of my colleagues, not my Dutch colleagues from the PVV, but my colleagues from the Front National, from the Bulgarian Ataka party, from the Austrian FPÖ party, from the British National Party, from the Hungarian Jobbik party and from the Flemish Vlaams Belang party."
"I should like to say, Mr President, that I do not for one second doubt the sincerity of the proposals you have made."
"However, you will permit me to say that I have doubts about their realism."
"You began by raising the problem of the economic crisis."
"It is a fact that millions of Europeans are seeing their assets and jobs threatened by the perverse effects of globalisation, which abandons them, for the benefit of the few, to the unfair competition of countries whose workers are cynically exploited, and to the rapacity of stateless financial interests."
"The Union, sadly, has not protected Europeans from this situation."
"On the contrary, it has plunged them into it."
"Secondly, from my modest position, but expressing the political forces that Mr Schulz was quite willing to admit are a threat to the traditional organisations - and I thank him for it - I should like to call on our Parliament, and yourself, Mr President, to be more modest and to set certain voluntary limits to our powers."
"I am thoroughly convinced, as a European and as a Christian, that a number of the values that we convey are universal values."
"I am even happier to insist that it is not our job to give the world principles and laws, all the more so because organisations, such as the United Nations, exist for that very purpose, and all the more so because there is a great deal to do in Europe itself, where, against the right to life, we are providing for the elimination of our own children, and where, against freedom of expression, we are pushing through a moral, media, political and judicial dictatorship of what is known as 'political correctness'."
"Political groups such as ours that express the suffering and the hopes of millions of Europeans are discriminated against, pursued and sometimes even dissolved, as the Vlaams Blok party was in Belgium in an absolute scandal that provoked not a single protest in this House."
"Had that have happened in Africa or in Latin America, we undoubtedly would have heard a different version of events."
"We non-attached Members do not have the same rights as the others - that much is clear - and, as we told you yesterday, we still do not have any representatives at the Conference of Presidents."
"Finally, due to the voting methods, millions of Europeans are denied the possibility of being represented in their own countries' legislative bodies, which are supposed to represent the electorate in all its diversity."
"To conclude, I should like to express the wish that we remember, at all times in our work, that Europe is, in the history of mankind, the region that invented the freedom of nations, which cannot be found elsewhere; the equal dignity of those nations; and respect for their jurisdiction and for the principle of non-interference, which means that everyone is in charge of their own affairs and on their own territory."
"That is one of the great contributions of European civilisation to man's heritage."
"Mr President, this is my first opportunity in my capacity as a member of the Council Presidency to stand before this Chamber and, on behalf of the Swedish Presidency and the whole of the Council and also myself personally, I would like to congratulate you most sincerely Mr President."
"Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is wonderful to see you in this position."
"It is a personal victory for you, I know."
"It is a victory for the European Parliament and it is also a victory for all of us who fervently support European cooperation and everything it stands for."
"I would also like to thank you for the visionary speech and the ambitious plans you have for this Parliament."
"I am convinced that the European Parliament rests safe in your hands."
"During your leadership, you will hopefully bring about concrete decisions, but indeed also the miracle you referred to."
"We in the Council look forward to working with you and the European Parliament."
"Many Members have spoken of the numerous challenges we are facing: the climate question, the economic crisis, jobs, Europe's role in the world and so on."
"You have an important legislative role here, in representing citizens, but also in the debate that is held here."
"It is extremely important for the European Parliament to always stand up for European values."
"If the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force - and that is something that I certainly hope will happen - the European Parliament's role will be extended and you will have a greater influence on the European agenda."
"I know that you will take the defence of the European Parliament and the institution's role seriously, but you will also hopefully be a bridge to other institutions as well as a serious partner for dialogue."
"The Presidency is very much looking forward to being your partner for dialogue over the next six years and we wish you the best of luck in your work."
"I would like to say to all new Members of the European Parliament that the Minister is a former Member of this House, and so is one of us."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and on my own behalf, I want sincerely to congratulate you once again and wish you all the best in your term of office."
"Your election symbolises not only the reunification of Europe, but also a Europe that is very much attached to the central values of freedom and solidarity."
"Personally and institutionally I want to commit to close cooperation with you and with the European Parliament."
"Parliament and the Commission are the two Community institutions par excellence at the heart of Community matters."
"You and all the Members of this Parliament have been directly elected by our citizens and the Commission has the right and the duty to put European interests above any particular interest."
"I believe that we have a special responsibility for the European project in full respect of the Treaties."
"That is why I want to reiterate my willingness to work together to advance European parliamentary democracy."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr Buzek, I very much enjoyed your speech and especially the part about the institutional, but also social role played by Parliament, which you described as the very essence of the European democratic system."
"Today we are celebrating the Union of 27 which has come together once more, meeting here following the divisions caused by the ideologies of terror which built walls on our continent, walls which did not endure and which were blown down by the winds of democracy and freedom."
"This year we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the first elections to Parliament by direct universal suffrage, together with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"I am pleased to recall, Mr Buzek, that when, for the first time, 30 years ago, my parents voted to elect the first MEPs from Italy, there was no right to vote in your country."
"In 1979, just one year after Karol Wojtyla was elected Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church, while in Italy and in other countries the first European Parliament elections were being held, you were active in the then semi-clandestine trade union Solidarność, which fought to bring democracy and freedom to your country."
"To assert those same rights - democracy and freedom - we went to the polls, while every day you were risking your life and repression."
"For that reason, President Buzek, I am honoured to have contributed with my small and possibly non-decisive vote to your election, and I am pleased that today in Parliament, various histories are coming together and being ennobled, inspired by the same values and ideals: histories which make the great history of this young Europe strong."
"(PL) Mr President, I congratulate you on your election, and on a good speech."
"I would have liked you to devote a little more attention in your speech to the countries of Eastern Europe."
"In the near future, a very difficult election will be held in Ukraine."
"The European Parliament has a particular responsibility to show concern for democratic procedures in that country."
"It was in the European Parliament, in the foremost institution of the European Union, that support began for the great changes which took place five years ago."
"I would ask that this matter, connected with the presidential election in Ukraine, be treated in a special and unconventional way, with the involvement of those institutions and delegations which have been designated for this, so that the European Parliament will be known as a serious institution which is concerned about democratic procedures in Ukraine."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate you and I would like to say one thing to you in particular."
"A Parliament is measured by the way in which it uses and puts into practice its rights and by the fact that it does not withdraw from major political debate."
"We are all responsible for working together with you to ensure that this Parliament is not subjected to pressure from Commission proposals which are half-baked or which represent the unilateral interests of specific lobbyists."
"We are responsible for speaking up clearly at this point and we must do so."
"We must think about how the Treaty of Lisbon will change our situation."
"I hope that we will be able to do all of this."
"We must demonstrate clearly - and, in my opinion, this also concerns the question of the election of the Commission President - that we are making use of our rights and we must send a clear signal to the Commission."
"This means that there must now be no direct election of Mr Barroso."
"(HU) President Buzek, allow me to address you directly, even though you are sitting in your member's seat."
"Your election in this Parliament has been viewed as a sign that there is no longer an Eastern bloc, but a united Europe."
"You mentioned this in your address when you talked about there being no more old and new Europe, just our Europe."
"Unfortunately, many people do not feel this way."
"You also referred in your address to the great fear that pervaded the countries which joined only in 2004."
"Today, however, you are aware of the sense of disappointment felt in these countries."
"The reason for this is that there is no equality of rights."
"Equal rights are the key issue."
"Mr Lindblad, the state secretary, mentioned that equality of rights was the budget's fundamental principle."
"If this really is the case, why is there no equality of rights with regard to agricultural subsidies?"
"Hungary proved that it is able to receive them with its institutional system, yet it is still discriminated against."
"Mr President, you have encouraged everyone to use their mother tongue."
"I am pleased that in this Parliament, as a Hungarian, I can enjoy equal rights, but in Slovakia I would be punished for using my mother tongue."
"Mr President, you have suggested acting as a mediator."
"We sincerely thank you for this offer."
"However, a real result will only be achieved by this action if the Hungarian minority can freely use their mother tongue in the land of their birth."
"I wish you every success with this too."
"(CS) Mr President, I am truly delighted that you, a citizen of high moral standing and a Silesian to boot, are taking the baton from the hand of Hans-Gert Pöttering and that, like him, you are emphasising the potential of a united European Union in terms of values such as human rights and solidarity between nations."
"This election period in the shadow of the economic crisis will put that solidarity to the test."
"I do not fear for it as far as the voting here is concerned, but I know that individual citizens and regional politicians are ever more frequently scrutinising our voting under the slogan of 'charity begins at home'."
"I would therefore like to call on you, Mr President, when reporting on our work here in the European parliament, to devote greater attention than has previously been the case to improvements in the position of Europeans in global terms."
"Mr President, I have always admired Mr Barroso as our Commission President, who is an Atlanticist free-marketeer, which my party strongly supports and holds dear."
"I am also a strong friend of Portugal, so I am very happy to support José Manuel."
"However, I am concerned at what I read yesterday in the Daily Telegraph that he has agreed with the ALDE Group to create a powerful new and intrusive Human Rights Commissioner in his Commission, straddling external and internal human rights issues."
"This seems to fly in the face of the Centre Right-led decision of this Parliament to reject a new combined Human Rights Committee and duplicates the work of the Council of Europe and its own Human Rights Commissioner."
"Please can President Barroso clarify his policies and intentions here?"
"I think that this question should have been asked at a different time today, namely when we discuss Mr Barroso's statement, and not at this time."
"(HU) President Buzek, you spoke about the Slovak-Hungarian dispute."
"It is not a Slovak-Hungarian dispute."
"It is, in fact, a Slovak-European Union dispute as it involves a country flouting fundamental European values."
"Your task is to help reach agreement not between Slovakia and Hungary, but between the European Union Parliament and Slovakia, as this country has infringed the documents and agreements which it has signed and ratified."
"Secondly, there is the issue of Silesia."
"I am pleased that you mentioned it."
"There are so many territories like this in the European Union which belonged to several different countries during the last century."
"We Hungarians were split among 10 countries after the First World War, of which seven are now EU Member States."
"We are very grateful that we can now be together without resorting to weapons and changing borders."
"During the last century, five official languages were learnt in the Lower Carpathians region."
"Why am I mentioning this?"
"It is because in my own country too, where I live in the Székely Land, in Transylvania, the current Romanian Government is still ashamed of our mother tongue and symbols."
"However, the problem with Europe's human rights values is not limited just to the Eastern bloc; it affects the West too."
"This is why we are urging that Europe have not only a commissioner for minorities, but also a minority framework law which is binding on every European country."
"Mr President, thank you for your speech."
"I believe, however, that our paths diverge considerably."
"I stand here before you as one who believes in a Europe of cooperating nations, not a Europe tied to the federalist approach of the Lisbon Treaty."
"On 2 October, the Irish electorate will be asked - for a second time - to vote for the Lisbon Treaty, a treaty cobbled together to circumvent the people's rejection of a European Constitution."
"I commend the electorate of the Irish Republic for exercising good sense in the first referendum, sense that I believe that they will show once again in the second one."
"I urge them to remain firm in their resolve to reject the Treaty."
"The post-dated promises and threats have done nothing to change the fundamentals of the Treaty."
"It remains the wrong path for Europe and Europe's nations."
"However, I believe that that choice should also be given to my people, the British people."
"They were promised a referendum by the Labour Government, and the Labour Government should fulfil that promise."
"If not, their possible successors in the Conservatives should do the same."
"(HU) Mr President, as a Hungarian and a friend of Poland, as well as an East European and a citizen of a new Member State, I derive great pleasure and satisfaction from your work as president because it can contribute to the full emancipation of the 12 new Member States."
"Until now, we have only been equal, but we would like to be more equal."
"You have made an historic pledge, Mr President, because you are prepared to tackle such a delicate issue as Silesia, which has not been tackled before."
"In other words, you are assuming a mediating role in dealing with national minority matters."
"Minorities account for 15% of Europe's population, 6.5% of which are migrant or immigrant minorities, primarily in Western Europe, and 8.5% historical minorities."
"The fact that you are willing to mediate in the Hungarian-Slovak conflict and between the Slovak majority and the Hungarian ethnic community in Slovakia is an historic act."
"I hope that the Commission will also follow this example."
"We cannot sweep minority issues in Europe under the carpet."
"Thank you for your attention and I wish you every success."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to express, Mr Buzek, how proud I am to be part of an institution as important as the European Parliament, which you chair."
"The sacrifices which you made in your country 20 years ago and which today allow those 12 countries which were mentioned earlier to be represented in this Chamber make Europe stronger."
"I would, however, like to express my concern over the programme you set out during your address which should, and I hope it will, strengthen Parliament."
"I hope that what you announced will come to fruition."
"I hope that the next President of the European Commission, who I am sure will be Mr Barroso, will listen to you on account of the forceful words that you used, to ensure that Parliament meets the needs of over 550 million European citizens who voted for us, who chose us, and who want and demand that Parliament and each and every one of us provide the answers which, perhaps, Europe has certainly tried to give, but without fully succeeding."
"With regard to this aspect of your work I am hopeful, and I am convinced that through you we will manage to attain that certainty that you yourself referred to."
"(CS) It was John Stuart Mill who said that parliament should be a mirror of national life."
"This is no mean feat and, in my opinion, it is important for our forthcoming term in office, especially as Europe is too important an issue to be entrusted solely to the decision making of the so-called political elites."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to congratulate you warmly on your speech."
"The process of bringing an end to the division of Europe was the result, on the one hand, of the desire for freedom among Central and Eastern European countries and, on the other, of course, of the attractiveness of Europe as an economic model."
"I believe that we have too little confidence, too little confidence in the future."
"If we cannot achieve this in Europe, then who can?"
"We should explain with greater conviction that we can work on resolving our problems with confidence."
"We have a great deal of potential and there are still opportunities for growth throughout the world."
"While there are still people in the world who need goods and services, there will still be opportunities for growth."
"We can make sure that in Europe, we have a slice of this cake and everyone involved will benefit."
"I would like to encourage all of us to have more confidence in Europe as a successful model and I would like to ask you to convey this idea in your speeches."
"(HU) Hungary commemorated the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom on 23 October 2006."
"On that day, a huge number of police, orchestrated by the government, attacked peaceful demonstrators, pedestrians and even numerous groups of foreign tourists in restaurants as they were quietly having a meal."
"Absolute terror reigned in the country."
"Many hundreds of people suffered serious injury, including 14 people who were shot in the eyes, many of whom also lost their sight."
"Many hundreds of people were put in prison and had sham criminal proceedings brought against them."
"This ended only recently with them all being released, virtually without exception."
"The Prime Minister paid tribute to the outstanding job done by the police."
"Today, Mr President, we have in this European Parliament Kinga Göncz, Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, who was a member of that government which sanctioned the shooting."
"I would like to hear your view on this, Mr President."
"I would also like to ask you, on Hungary's behalf, to be true to the spirit of solidarity, to fight for human rights in the European Union, and to fight to put an end to the human rights crisis which has been going on in Hungary since autumn 2006."
"I would also call on the person in this Parliament who reminds people of this situation and brings shame to the House to resign from her post as Vice-Chairman of the LIBE Committee."
"(HU) As a Hungarian living in Romania, I would like to congratulate President Jerzy Buzek, in the spirit of solidarity, a worthy successor to our former president, Hans-Gert Pöttering."
"In the spirit of solidarity, let us remember that Polish refugees were welcomed by Hungary 70 years ago."
"In the spirit of solidarity, I wish to express our pleasure that one of the key figures in Solidarność has been appointed to lead Parliament."
"Let us also remember Pope John Paul II and the faith aspect."
"Solidarność and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution signified freedom, while the events in Temesvár (Timişoara), along with the personality and spirituality of Pope John Paul, represent the power of faith."
"We also expect that through their accession, the Polish people and Eastern Europe will make the same contribution and bring greater faith."
"This is why I am looking forward to President Buzek's presidency with confidence."
"(PL) Mr President, I would also like to congratulate you very sincerely, not only on your election, but also on your speech today, because you have shown that we have one Europe, and that there are no old and new countries."
"Europe also remains diverse, and what you have pledged, that the European Parliament will reflect this diversity in its work, is of immense value."
"This does not mean, however, that Europe is equal."
"Indeed, there are many differences, which we in the European Parliament should tackle."
"Citizens of the European Union very often receive entirely different remuneration for doing the same work."
"Citizens of the European Union today, in numbers which are always too high, are without work, and this is another matter which we should tackle."
"There is too much diversity and inequality in terms of access to the benefits associated with education, culture and health care."
"This is a tremendous challenge, which the European Parliament, under your leadership, should also set itself."
"I would like to find out what you think should be done, in the context of what was said about a common energy policy, with an undertaking which is today more German and Russian than European?"
"I am thinking of the gas pipeline, because you spoke about energy policy."
"There is also the question of enlargement of the European Union - what about Ukraine?"
"What time scale are we setting for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union?"
"Thank you, Mr Buzek, not least for the painstaking precision with which you responded to all the speeches, without exception."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I congratulate you on your election to the position of President of the European Parliament."
"Along with all our compatriots, I am proud that for the first time in history, a Pole has taken up this position of honour."
"This is, for us, confirmation of our role and position in Europe."
"At the same time, Poland is one of the few remaining countries which have not completed the ratification procedure for the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty which would make European integration more effective."
"I find this paradoxical."
"I will remind you that the Polish Parliament approved ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon in April of this year, but the ratification documents have yet to be signed by the President."
"I think that you could make a valuable contribution to public debate in Poland and help to increase the support of society for the treaty, which could speed up completion of the ratification procedure."
"I would also like to thank you for your personal involvement in this matter in Ireland."
"I hope very strongly that the Irish people will vote 'yes' on 2 October, and that the necessary formalities will then be completed by the Czech Republic and Poland."
"Helping to bring an end to the 'Lisbon ratification saga' is one of the most important objectives of this Parliament, and I hope that it will also be one of its successes."
"This is an important moment in the history of European integration."
"Thank you for the programme which you have presented."
"I hope that you will manage to complete this ambitious agenda."
"I wish you success in directing the work of the European Parliament in accordance with values which are important for all Europeans."
"Just as the Polish Solidarity movement was able to change the face of Poland and other countries in Central Europe, so European solidarity will enable us to meet the challenges before which we stand today."
"This will be possible under certain conditions, namely that our solidarity will have to be consistent, genuine and determined to bring about changes."
"Just as in Poland, where totalitarianism did not fall because of words, but because of deeds, so European solidarity will be effective if it is translated into specific action."
"I believe that this will indeed happen."
"This vision of the future of Europe is attractive to very many Europeans."
"I am counting on the European Parliament, under your leadership, Mr President, to play a positive and intensive role in making this vision a reality. Thank you very much."
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.25 and resumed at 15.00)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting"
"(DE) Mr President, I have no comments on the minutes of yesterday's session, but instead I would like to comment on an incident in this morning's session."
"My colleague, Kinga Göncz, a Member of Parliament in my group and former Hungarian Foreign Minister, was insulted in the debate this morning by Krisztina Morvai from the fascist Jobbik party in a completely unacceptable way."
"As Foreign Minister for Hungary, Mrs Göncz has worked harder than almost anyone else in the country to achieve international reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbouring countries."
"I would like to reject emphatically the outrageous insult made to Mrs Göncz by Mrs Morvai, a member of a neo-fascist party."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) Thank you for this opportunity to speak."
"I am very sorry that this discussion is being held here in the European Parliament."
"I would also like to respond briefly by saying that the party represented by Krisztina Morvai set up a paramilitary unit in 2006 and, since then, is using it to intimidate the peaceful public majority."
"This includes, in particular, minorities, gays, Roma and Jews."
"This paramilitary unit was recently disbanded by the courts, but an MEP from this party wore the uniform of this organisation in this chamber during the July session."
"In Hungary, this party conducted a campaign full of anti-European, racist, homophobic, anti-Roma and xenophobic diatribes and regularly described Hungary as a colony of the European Union in its utterances."
"The event which Krisztina Morvai spoke about took place in 2006 when these extreme right-wing protesters set the Hungarian television broadcasting corporation's central building on fire and ran riot for days, resulting in 113 police officers being injured."
"They ran riot again on 23 October."
"They tried, in fact, to disrupt a national ceremony using violence."
"This was the first time in the country's history, since the change of regime, that the police had had any experience of dealing with extreme right-wing protests."
"After this, the government set up an independent committee, whose reports are available on a wide range of websites, including in English."
"This committee made suggestions and numerous court proceedings were also initiated."
"Hungarian government bodies investigated these abuses."
"There were indeed problems."
"However, I would like to say to Krisztina Morvai that if she is calling the institutional system in her own country dictatorial, the problem with this is that if democracy was not really working in Hungary, she would not have been able to make her speech in this Chamber just now."
"I apologise again that this subject was raised before Parliament and I sincerely hope that this discussion will not be continued here."
"(HU) Mr President, according to the Rules of Procedure, I have half a minute to ask a question."
"This question is addressed to Mr Schulz."
"Based on the slanderous statements made here by his colleague, how can he dare call a party fascist in this Chamber, simply because it does not agree with every aspect of the European Union's main thrust?"
"This party received 430 000 votes in Hungary."
"You are therefore calling 430 000 voters fascist."
"From now on, think before you speak!"
"Signature of acts adopted under codecision: see Minutes"
"Statement by the President-designate of the Commission (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the President-designate of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living in unprecedented times."
"I personally am convinced that the history books of the future will refer to the pre-financial crisis era and the post-financial crisis era."
"Yet this crisis is not just a financial, economic and social one."
"It is also a crisis of values."
"That is why I believe that we must put our European social model, our social market economy, at the heart of our response to this crisis."
"At the same time, the crisis has shown just how interdependent we have become in this globalised era."
"There is the financial crisis, but also the energy crisis."
"There are the food security problems and climate change, an area in which Europe is now the leader."
"That is why I feel we can say that this is the moment of truth for Europe."
"Do we want to shape globalisation with our values, by defending our interests, or do we want to suffer globalisation, by following the lead of others?"
"For me, the choice is clear."
"We must rise to this challenge together because, if we do not do so together, Europe is in danger of being marginalised."
"We have experience."
"I do not believe that any another region in the world has the same experience as we have of establishing an internal market, common rules, common institutions, and indeed a single currency and solidarity and cohesion policies."
"We have this unique experience."
"I therefore believe that, instead of suffering globalisation, we can shape it, because we are, by nature, a globalisation laboratory; we are the champions of global governance."
"Now is not the time for the status quo, or routine."
"We must have an agenda for change."
"Now more than ever we need a strong Europe."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be stronger in the future and we will be better able to act."
"When I say a stronger Europe, let us be clear what that means."
"It does not necessarily mean more centralisation of powers."
"I am committed to the democratic principle of subsidiarity, subsidiarity linked, of course, to solidarity, with decisions being taken at the most appropriate level."
"When I speak of a stronger Europe, I am also speaking of the European spirit, of the culture of European decision-making, of the Community method and of the will to act together - not only the ability to act but also the will to act, the political will."
"We need a Europe that is uncompromising when it comes to defending its values and its interests, which rejects protectionism of all kinds, but without being naive, and which can demonstrate this proactive spirit."
"It is this proactive spirit that guided the drafting of the document that I sent to you all before this sitting."
"The mandate of the Commission over which I currently preside was that of the first Commission of the enlarged Europe, of the great Europe of 27."
"I believe that, now we have consolidated this Europe, we have the conditions in place for a new ambition: a new social ambition, because there is a crisis and unemployment is the main problem facing Europeans; a new ambition regarding the fight against climate change, an area in which we already play a leading role; and a new ambition in terms of the way we deal with globalisation."
"Last week I had the opportunity to discuss these political guidelines with all the political groups that invited me."
"I think it was a very useful, constructive and open discussion."
"I received many points of view."
"I believe that the time has now come for us to reach a broad consensus and to reach some level of agreement on the way forward."
"Before you all today I formerly pledge that - if I am confirmed by this Parliament - I will apply those political guidelines during my second term and I will, together with incoming Commissioners, translate them into the next Commission's legislative and work programme."
"I am not going to repeat those guidelines now but I think, after discussions with all of you, that it will be useful to make some of the elements in the guidelines more concrete and also to take on board a number of your suggestions."
"In the interests of transparency, I would like to highlight those areas with all of you now."
"First of all, the basic line: as we fully implement our recovery plan in order to move out of this economic and financial crisis, we must keep an eye on the future."
"We must reinvigorate our inclusive social market economy."
"We will invest in new sources of sustainable growth, in smart green growth, in the networks of the future from digital infrastructure to the European super grids for electricity and gas - all this to promote high levels of employment and social provision and to reinforce the European model of society, while succeeding in an increasingly competitive world."
"Solidarity must remain key."
"That is why, apart from all the decisions already taken and proposed in terms of structural funds and in terms of doubling our balance of payment support for some countries in difficulties, I want to commit myself to using all the instruments at my disposal to help those Member States with serious budgetary constraints - namely the new Member States - back onto the road to recovery."
"But we cannot return to the previous growth model."
"It has clearly proved unsustainable."
"We have to create the conditions where the transition to a low-carbon economy is a source of competitive advantage for our businesses, a source of jobs for our workers and a source of hope for future generations."
"Yes, I agree with those of you who said that coordination is not enough."
"Yes, we need to map out a genuine European agenda."
"Yes, we need an integrated vision for a coherent European strategy, a European Union 2020 strategy that builds on open markets by combining new sources of sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion, our climate and energy security agenda, a fresh approach to industrial policy and a move to a knowledge society."
"I stand for a particular emphasis on innovation and support measures for SMEs."
"Yes, this means overhauling the Lisbon Strategy after 2010."
"Yes, we need a much more integrated approach to the economic, social and environmental strands of the different strategies."
"As President of the Commission, I commit myself to doing my best to convince Member States also to accept this coherence and coordination approach."
"I said in the guidelines that the economy needs a financial system that is more ethical, robust and responsible."
"Regulation and supervision have not kept pace with the integration and innovation of financial markets - not in Europe; not at a global level."
"Let me say that I have been shocked by the scale of unethical behaviour that we have seen."
"We cannot allow a return to 'business as usual'."
"The issue of bonuses, for instance, requires urgent action."
"We are now in a leading position in the G20 - a process which, by the way, was started in Europe - but it is true that more needs to be done."
"Next week, on the eve of the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, the Commission will adopt proposals to build a true European system of supervision - a system that reflects the integrated nature of our single market."
"A review of our action in three years will provide an opportunity to see what further action is needed."
"It is crucial that we get regulation that ensures the responsibility and the legitimacy of the financial sector without suffocating innovation."
"I want Europe to keep its world leadership in financial services."
"In my guidelines, I also explained why the crisis calls for a much stronger focus on the social dimension in Europe at all levels of decision making - in Europe, but also at a national level."
"The financial sector and the economy may be showing signs of recovery but - let us be clear - the crisis is not over for those who have lost their jobs and we cannot say the crisis is over before we come back to the creation of employment instead of rising unemployment."
"I would like to make my commitment to a high level of employment and social cohesion through a number of actions that I have discussed with some of you."
"I have clearly stated my attachment to the respect of fundamental social rights and to the principle of the movement of workers."
"The interpretation and the implementation of the Posted Workers Directive fall short in both respects."
"That is why I am committed to proposing, as soon as possible, a regulation to resolve the problems that have arisen."
"This regulation will be codecided by the European Parliament and the Council."
"A regulation has the advantage of giving much more legal certainty than the revision of the directive itself, which would still leave too much room for diverging national transpositions and take longer to produce real effects on the ground."
"But, if we discover during the preparation of the regulation that there are areas where we need to revisit the directive itself, I will not hesitate to do so."
"Let me be clear - I am committed to fighting social dumping in Europe whatever form it takes."
"The issue of social impact assessments for all future proposals was also raised and I agree that this is needed."
"The first test case for such a social impact assessment should be the revision of the Working Time Directive."
"On the basis of this impact assessment, the next Commission will consult social partners and will come with a comprehensive legislative proposal."
"In the guidelines, I emphasise the importance of services of general interest for our European model of society."
"The Lisbon Treaty makes this point very clear and I am ready to work with you to develop a quality framework for services of general interest."
"I also highlighted gender equality and the need to eliminate the gender pay gap, so I now commit myself to working with you on a Women's Charter, also as a way of commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Beijing Conference in 2010."
"In my guidelines, I express my determination to make the Lisbon Treaty innovations in international relations, including the European External Action Service and the post of High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, work effectively."
"I believe it is one of the greatest innovations of our Lisbon Treaty and I am committed to reinforcing cooperation with the European Parliament in the field of external affairs in general."
"Europe needs the means to match its ambitions, however."
"As I said in the guidelines, this requires a root-and-branch reform of the European Union budget covering the expenditure and revenue side."
"We need to move away from a narrow focus on net balances and move towards an approach based on solidarity, burden-sharing and equity."
"This also includes the question of own resources."
"The European Union must have a more transparent and efficient way of financing its policies and I am ready - I hope with the support of this Parliament - to take this battle to the Member States as we reshape the Union's budget."
"I also want to work more closely with the European Investment Bank to look at innovative forms of financing."
"I am also committed to smart regulation, and I want to reiterate that the simplification of procedures and the reduction of administrative burdens on businesses, particularly SMEs, will remain a priority in the next Commission."
"This task - just like the Impact Assessment Board and ex post evaluation - will be placed directly under my authority to fully reflect the priority I give to it."
"I will also defend - as we have done over the years and sometimes in difficult circumstances - the integrity of the single market because, without a single market and without a cohesion policy, we will never have a European Union."
"But why stop there?"
"Why only defend the internal market?"
"I want to complete the missing links to unleash its full benefits for businesses and consumers."
"Honourable Members, I am committed to translating these priorities into the organisation of the next College once I have been confirmed by you, but I can already share with you today some organisational changes that I intend to introduce."
"I will create the post of Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Civil Liberties, including citizens' and minority rights as a reflection that the European Union is a community of rights and values."
"I will also create the post of Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration, including security."
"One of the key tasks of this Commissioner will be to develop a truly common approach to migration: promoting the integration of legal migrants, fighting illegal migration and related criminal activities, and ensuring solidarity between Member States."
"We need solidarity."
"We need solidarity when we have to give support to our Baltic friends or countries affected by the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine, but we also need solidarity when we have to give support to our Mediterranean friends when they are facing challenges with which they cannot cope alone."
"I will also create the post of Commissioner for Climate Action to reflect the fact that climate change is a challenge that needs to be addressed across the whole range of our policies."
"A dedicated Commissioner for Climate Action will also send an important signal that, independently of the level of ambition that comes out of Copenhagen, Europe is serious about maintaining momentum for action."
"We also need a fundamental review of the way the European institutions access and use scientific advice."
"In the next Commission, I want to create the post of Chief Scientific Adviser, with the power to deliver proactive, scientific advice throughout all stages of policy development and delivery."
"This will reflect the central priority I attach to research and innovation."
"I think we have a lot to do in this field."
"If there is one area where the fragmented efforts in Europe are not giving the results we want, it is precisely in the field of research and innovation."
"I believe that, from fighting climate change to energy security, the potential is there if we want to work together in research and innovation for Europe."
"What I propose is no less than a transformational agenda for Europe."
"In order to realise this ambition, I have suggested a special partnership between Parliament and the Commission."
"We represent the two European institutions par excellence and this gives us a special responsibility to create a true European public space for debate."
"I am committed to making my contribution to European parliamentary democracy."
"I have had the opportunity to discuss this over the last couple of months with President Buzek, which led to many of the improvements proposed in my guidelines, like a regular question time."
"Following my meetings with the groups, I am ready to take up the suggestion made by some of you, not only to meet your Conference of Presidents on a more regular basis, but also to establish an appropriate dialogue with your Conference of Committee Chairs."
"Very concretely, I will invite the Conference of Committee Chairs to meet the whole College of Commissioners every year before the adoption of the Commission legislative and work programme."
"We are indeed living in very exceptional times, times of uncertainty and power shifts."
"There may be a fundamental change in the relations between the most important powers in the world and there is indeed a great risk in these times of anxiety of the emergence of national egoisms, of naked nationalism, of ugly nationalism and some forms of extremism."
"There is a real danger that our achievements in European integration are called into question."
"That is why I believe it is important to have this special relationship between Commission and Parliament to fight those national egoisms."
"Let me finish with a plea to each and every one of you."
"Now, more than ever, we need a strong Europe and a strong European Commission - a strong Commission, let us be frank, has to be a political Commission - but a political Commission must not be a partisan Commission."
"As President of the Commission, my party is Europe."
"The next College, like the current one, will contain a significant number of members from a variety of political families."
"I am committed to having Europe's political diversity reflected in the College and in the most important positions."
"Only with this cross-party support, however, can we, in fact, have a strong Europe and a strong Commission."
"We need a Commission that delivers on its promises."
"We also need a Parliament capable of mobilising the effective majorities necessary for a Europe of action."
"If you want a strong Commission that sometimes stands up to Member States and to national egoisms, you should give the Commission the strong support it needs."
"We all have our different political, ideological positions and we come from very different political families but I believe that, in times like the ones we are living in, in times of crisis, apart from our convictions, we also need a strong ethic of European responsibility."
"It is to this ethic of European responsibility to each of you that I make my appeal - my appeal with passion for Europe."
"Let us embark on this European journey together."
"(Sustained applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been asking myself in the last few days why a candidate who is so controversial across all the groups in this Parliament causes so little controversy in the Council."
"I believe that the answer is obvious."
"If I had been a head of government, I would also have elected José Manuel Durão Barroso."
"There could have been no better advocate of the interests of the European Council over the last five years."
"For this reason, your call, Mr Barroso, for cooperation with Parliament is correct, but it comes too late."
"(Applause)"
"One aspect of the last five years was the fact that you were constantly at the service of the governments in the European Union and that is precisely one of the reasons why there is so much scepticism about you."
"Many friends are more dangerous than enemies."
"You had hardly finished your speech with the claim: 'I am everyone's candidate!', before Mr Daul said: 'This is the candidate of the Group of the European People's Party'."
"What a risk for you, Mr Barroso!"
"What motive would another possible majority in this House have for electing you if your programme is the programme of the Group of the European People's Party?"
"We could have started with a different majority."
"In July, we saw a possible majority form in this House on the basis of different considerations among the various groups, which Guy Verhofstadt brought together into a reform-based, pro-European majority."
"This resulted in the vote being postponed until September and other things would perhaps also have been possible."
"Unfortunately, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe did not continue to support their leader, otherwise this would have been possible."
"This is why we are voting today and weighing up whether what you are saying is convincing."
"However, you have hardly started to concentrate on one programme before you begin doing something different."
"In the last few days you have been sending out your messengers on horseback with the following message: 'Moi, j'ai la majorité, I have the majority'."
"It may be that you have a majority tomorrow."
"That could be the case."
"Perhaps you will have a majority tomorrow, consisting of the PPE Group and the ALDE Group, the majority of whom will vote for you, and, of course, the only group which will vote for you unanimously, immediately and without hesitation: the European Conservatives and Reformists, the party of Mr Kaczyński and his brother, the party of Mr Klaus, the Tory party."
"As you say, you want to achieve a majority in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, but this is the party whose members oppose the treaty."
"How can you lead Europe in a pro-European way if you enter into alliances of this kind?"
"(Applause)"
"Furthermore, this is not only about you."
"It is true that it is about you, but it is also about the question: Barroso - yes or no?"
"It is about the question of whether you gain a majority - yes or no?"
"However, it is also about another issue."
"It is about the direction of Europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone."
"In this case, the Council and, above all, this Parliament are also involved in making the decision about the composition of the College and about the portfolios which you will make available and about the programme for the next five years that you will present."
"It is about you, but it is also about the question of whether we finally manage to regulate the internal market and the financial markets and about whether we finally manage to put a stop to cheap labour in Europe, which is destroying the social cohesion of our society."
"It is also about whether we manage to bring about a change of direction in the European Union which the Commission, as a whole, must support."
"Therefore, for us it is also a question of programme-related issues."
"It is not enough to reduce Europe to the question of an individual person and to the question of whether this individual person has a majority or not."
"We need more!"
"We need social impact assessments."
"You have said that you will put them in place."
"We will judge you by whether you really do this, whether you are prepared to draw up regulations together with Parliament in an interinstitutional agreement."
"In future, the Commission must consider in advance what the effects of its measures on the social security systems in the Member States will be."
"We want and need a directive for public services, for services of general interest."
"It must not be the case that the Commission will not rest until the last public cemetery in Europe is privatised."
"This strategy must finally be stopped."
"We also need a change of direction on wage policy in Europe."
"Whichever tool we choose, Mr Barroso, I expect to hear one sentence from you."
"You have failed to say it again today."
"However, I expect you to say it once."
"The objective of the Commission, particularly following the verdict of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the cases of Viking, Laval and Rüffert, must be equal pay for equal work in the same place for both men and women."
"These are the issues relating to programmes and content which we want to discuss with you, but not only with you."
"It is also a question of who the Commissioners are and which portfolios they have."
"I do not know what has caused greater damage to Europe, you yourself or the fact that you have not prevented Mr McCreevy from doing what he was able to."
"We need a change of direction within the EU."
"This is what we will judge you on."
"(Applause)"
"Therefore, we can see a connection between tomorrow's vote and the final vote on the Commission."
"There is a way to get there."
"There is the possibility of achieving greater agreement and trust than is currently the case."
"However, with regard to your balance sheet for the last five years and to what you have presented us with thus far - I am not talking about what may happen in future, but what is currently on the table - I can say one thing to you with certainty: you do not have the support of my group."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to inform you that we have a new rule of procedure."
"Perhaps not all of you have taken note of it yet."
"The rule says that if, during a speech, Members present in the House raise a blue card, they may put a question to the person who is speaking."
"The question must be no longer than half a minute's duration, and can be asked only with the speaker's agreement."
"This is a new rule, which we did not have before."
"This is intended to enliven our debates."
"(PT) Mr President, I will be very brief: Mr Schulz, I listened to you very carefully and I share many of the issues that you put to the President of the Commission, who is now standing again."
"I even heard you say that Socialists do not only support the right and Europe is not made up solely of the right."
"I ask you, how many members of your parliamentary group - Socialists, Portuguese, Spanish or English - have already given their support to the new candidate, irrespective of the opinions that you yourself hold, Mr Schulz?"
"(DE) Mr President, I must admit that I do not know the fellow Member."
"However, I am pleased that as new fellow Members..."
"(Heckling)"
"He has been here for a while?"
"I have not really noticed him until now."
"After what I have heard, I understand why."
"We will decide this evening on the final vote for our group."
"I do not know how deeply democratic the structures in your party are, but we are a democratic party and so we will decide this evening by means of a democratic vote."
"I would like to say that only one question per speech is foreseen, because otherwise we might not finish the debate."
"Mr President, since the start of this appointment procedure, as you know, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has said that what is at stake here is the programme for the next five years, that this is not a question of people or of personalities."
"This is what counts: the programme that the candidate presents, the one that he presents now in its broad outlines, then the detailed programme, which will be presented towards the end of the year, I hope, when the Commission is finalised."
"Secondly, at the request of some of my colleagues, our group has also debated at length whether we should wait before taking a final decision."
"We supported that in July, because we felt it necessary for the candidate to come equipped with a programme, which was not the case in the past."
"I believe that it was the right decision to do so, to wait in July, not to appoint and to wait for the proposals that we are going to debate now."
"However, we felt that, once the candidate had presented his guidelines, there was no point in saying once again that we were going to wait a few weeks or months."
"We are going through an economic and financial crisis, therefore we need European institutions and we need a Commission."
"It is not very responsible ..."
"(Applause)"
"..."
"It is not very responsible to say today, 'Let us wait'."
"Wait for what?"
"Wait two weeks, three weeks, two months, until they come with proposals?"
"They are there."
"Let us assume our responsibilities, whether we vote for or against, but let us assume our responsibilities."
"Thirdly, we were not very convinced by the guidelines presented by the candidate."
"I believe that these proposals, as detailed as they sometimes are, are based on a flawed philosophy, that is, on the assumption that the recession is over, that a recovery is taking place and that we do not need additional Community policies in order to come out of the crisis."
"That is a poor starting point, because the end of the recession does not mean that this is the start of the recovery."
"We may fall into economic stagnation, as is the case in Japan, where they have been waiting for growth for 10 to 15 years."
"Hence the need to have, in addition, a new integrated Community strategy that goes beyond the 27 national plans."
"That is the demand we are making as liberals and as democrats, and it is just as important for the Commission to present as quickly as possible a plan for cleaning up the banks."
"Not 27 different plans, as we have today, but a common, consistent approach set out by the Commission."
"I heard, Mr Barroso, that you said in our group that you were prepared to submit proposals concerning both this new integrated Community strategy, which goes beyond the 27 national plans, and this European stabilisation of the banking sector."
"This is positive, and what we are asking is for these two elements to be detailed and developed in the programme that you are now going to prepare and that you are going to present with the Commission."
"Our support is very clear."
"It is conditional."
"This means that our support will continue until such time as we see that these elements, that is, a new integrated Community strategy, a plan for stabilising the banking sector, beyond the things you repeated today in your speech, a budget based on own resources, and a mid-term review of financial supervision, are going to materialise in every part of the Commission's programme."
"On this subject, I must tell you that I continue to believe that it is the structure of the European Central Bank that should be used, not the de Larosière proposals, which are the Commission's and the Council's starting point for the moment."
"Lastly, our support will also depend, as you know, on the new structure of the Commission."
"We want an effective Commission, with powers distributed more evenly than was the case in the past and, in this context, we are also counting on the promise that you made to our group, namely that a particular commissioner from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with responsibility for fundamental rights and civil liberties, will be given a place in your team."
"It is important that this commissioner be jointly responsible with the other commissioners, and not just someone who gives them opinions."
"That is why, for the common good of Europe, we need more audacity and a more ambitious Commission, and we hope that you will ensure this and hope, too, that in your definitive programme you will fulfil our expectations."
"Mr President, President-designate, ladies and gentlemen, I confess that I think I am hallucinating."
"Firstly we are told: 'everything has changed, so I am staying!'"
"The reason why Mr Barroso must stay is because everything is changing, and he is the stability in a changing world."
"So be it."
"Then, I hear what Mr Daul has to say."
"I was part of the electoral campaign in France."
"In France, we were told, during the electoral campaign, that, on the banks, look to Mr Sarkozy, on climate change, look to Mr Sarkozy, on change in Europe, look to Mr Sarkozy."
"Now I hear Mr Daul say that, on climate change, look to Mr Barroso, on issue X, Y or Z, look to Mr Barroso."
"You are going to get a roasting from the Elysée Palace, my friend!"
"You are going to get a roasting!"
"All the same, it is incredible, this whole business!"
"Yes, yes, I know, May 68, it annoys you, you always come out with the same old thing."
"I will explain it to you one day if you want to hear about it."
"All I am saying is that this place, right here, is a place where we have the right to say anything."
"José Manuel Obama: Yes, he can!"
"He can do anything he likes now; he can do everything that he was unable to do for five years."
"You will see what happens, and, on that note, Heads of State or Government, Mrs Malmström, be careful, because the days of the little Mr Barroso who listens to you are over."
"You are going to have to listen to him now, he is going to impose a new integrated policy, not a policy of coordination, on you, you are going to have to follow his lead ..."
"No, but stop, stop, Mr Barroso!"
"We know what you are like!"
"In five years in this House, not once have you said, 'I was wrong', as I, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, and others have done ..."
"For you talk about European values, you talk about European ethics, but the problem is this, Mr Barroso. If you really want to change things, you must explain something to the MEPs and to the citizens: the response to the financial and economic crisis must, at the same time, be a response to the environmental crisis."
"Moreover, if you want to respond to these crises you have to transform Europe - to reform it is not enough - and by that I mean you have to transform it environmentally and socially."
"Our production systems must be called into question."
"The banks: why did they go crazy?"
"Because we have a system that makes them completely crazy."
"Why?"
"For the simple reason that it is about having more and more, and still more, more quickly."
"Is it the case, Mr Barroso, is it the case, Heads of State or Government, that the majority of this House is ready today to challenge the 'more and more as quickly as possible' approach?"
"This is at the root of the crisis, and when people talk about sustainable development, it is not just about a few piecemeal measures, it is about trying to explain and to understand that, while there are areas that need growth, that is, selective growth - renewables, and so on - there are a whole host of areas that need to be curbed."
"There needs to be a measure, and here I am hallucinating even more."
"You talked about the Lisbon process."
"You talked about research."
"Mr Barroso, explain something to me."
"For five years - actually, for four years: last year, after the crisis, you were more cautious - you explained to us that the basis for economic and environmental effectiveness was deregulation."
"Deregulation."
"Yes indeed, I remember your speeches, I remember what you said."
"Then, with the crises, you suddenly realised that it did not work like that."
"With the crises, and this is to your credit, we never said that you were a man of dishonour, we merely said that, seeing the way in which you, Mr Barroso, have led this Commission, we do not have faith in you."
"You are a European but, at the same time, you are locked in an ideology that is the very ideology that caused the crisis, not that which solves it."
"And, Mr Verhofstadt, that really takes the biscuit, now."
"Throughout the campaign we said - I am going to finish here, and, besides, Mr Barroso will thank us for it - that we did not want to vote in July."
"Now, everyone is grateful to us that the vote did not take place in July, because at least Mr Barroso could present his programme."
"If it was up to Mr Daul, if it was up to Mr Barroso, we would have voted without a programme in July, and everything would have been just fine!"
"So at least thank us for having given you the opportunity to present your programme."
"Not at all, not at all, Mr Barroso."
"Secondly - but this is rich - you say: 'why postpone further?'"
"For the simple reason, and this has never existed before, that the people of Ireland are going to vote in three weeks' time and if, as I believe will happen, as is thought will happen, they vote in favour of the Treaty of Lisbon, there is another condition for this Commission."
"You tell us: 'it is absolutely necessary, because we are in an economic crisis, you will see what happens'."
"Over the next two months, Mr Barroso will have to form his Commission."
"He will not have the time to deal with Lisbon, nor with Copenhagen, because he will have to negotiate with Mr Sarkozy."
"Is Mr Barnier going to get the internal market?"
"If Mr Barnier does get the internal market, what is he going to give to the Poles, to whom he promised a great Commission?"
"What is he going to give to the Germans?"
"What is he going to give to the British?"
"Because the Commission is all about bargaining!"
"And bargaining is going to keep him busy, but while he is busy bargaining, the others are going to bargain at Copenhagen."
"That is the problem; that is the reality."
"So I shall conclude by saying to you, Mr Barroso, that you are a man of honour, that is true, but you should know one thing: the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance does not have faith in you and will vote against your appointment, because we believe that Europe needs someone better, someone better than you, Mr Barroso!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Cohn-Bendit may have spoken for too long, and it may be that I hardly agree with him at all, but he always has interesting things to say, and that, after all, is important in Parliament."
"This gives Parliament the vitality which you spoke of, Mr President, in your speech at the beginning today."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists will vote for President-designate Barroso."
"We will not do this because we agree with you on everything, Mr President."
"There are, unfortunately, many questions on which we do not agree."
"I will mention at the outset your enthusiastic support for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We do not share that enthusiastic support, but we do share the dislike and condemnation of all forms of national egoism and nationalism which you expressed in your speech."
"Indeed, it was to Europe, to our continent, which we want to be at peace and to live on in peace, that national egoisms and chauvinisms brought an ocean of misery. We thank God that today, we live in a Europe at peace."
"We do not agree on some of the matters about which Mr Barroso spoke."
"We are entitled to disagree, and we will defend that right, although some continually question the simple fact that voters in Europe have elected European Conservatives and Reformists, and I promise that they will elect still more of them."
"We are going to be here, and our voice is going to be heard."
"We are entitled, therefore, to say on behalf of our voters that we support Mr Barroso in his difficult mission."
"I am glad that mention has been made today of European solidarity."
"I am glad it was said that the Commission - the new Commission under the leadership of Mr Barroso - will direct its efforts to enable us to overcome the economic crisis."
"This is extremely important, and we are pleased that the ambitious programme which Mr Barroso has presented indeed appears to be directed at the most important areas, where action on our part is needed."
"This, by the way, shows how great the need is for cooperation between the nations in today's Europe."
"The crisis has affected all of us, irrespective of the political structure and economy we are part of, irrespective of the region of Europe where our countries are found."
"The crisis is affecting us all, and all of us must fight the crisis."
"Mr President, in giving you support on behalf of our group, I would like to appeal to you to ensure that, in the coming months, Europe does not remain indifferent to what is happening in world politics."
"I do not hide the fact that, in my opinion, one of the most important tests which awaits the western world is what is happening today in Iran."
"Iran is a country which makes no secret of its nuclear ambitions."
"The President of that country not only denies the horrific crime of the holocaust, but also threatens Israel today with destruction."
"It seems to me that there should be no place for this type of behaviour, and it should not find acceptance in a modern, democratic world."
"Our group expects that the European Commission under your leadership will resolutely oppose the undemocratic procedures and undemocratic policies of the present authorities in Iran, which are directed against our greatest ally in the Middle East - against the state of Israel."
"We also expect - and I am pleased that this always comes through strongly in what you say, Mr President - that the foreign policy of the European Union will always be a banner for citizens' freedoms, and that it will also promote our common European values beyond our borders."
"I am sure that you did not manage to avoid making mistakes in the previous Parliamentary term, but then no-one who is involved in politics avoids making mistakes - that, unfortunately, is the way things are in this world."
"However, in the hard work which you do undertake, we are counting on you to hold high the banner of European values, and to work for the good - and I would like to stress this - of a common and united Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, you represent the continuity of a policy, Mr Barroso, which has contributed to the greatest economic crisis in post-war history."
"While the casinos in the major financial centres are reopening, the citizens of the world are footing the bill."
"The consequences of the crisis are unemployment, poverty, lower incomes and less education."
"You maintain that the financial crisis came primarily from the US and that it was only the bankers who caused the collapse."
"We say that the political system, including the policies of the EU Commission, was responsible for promoting casino capitalism."
"The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis."
"Continuing as we have done in the past will result in an even more serious crisis."
"The political system must take responsibility, learn from its mistakes and give up its neo-liberal ideals."
"European policy must focus consistently on the interests of the people of Europe."
"I cannot identify a focus of this kind in your guidelines. However, I am pleased that in your remarks today, social issues were given greater importance than was the case a year ago."
"I would like to illustrate our political disagreement using some examples."
"You want to adhere to the Lisbon strategy."
"However, the people of Europe need good jobs at wages which will allow them to live with dignity."
"We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours."
"We expect the new Commission to restructure the Posting of Workers Directive."
"Europe must finally give a guarantee that social rights will not be sacrificed to the competitive approach."
"For this reason, we have proposed, together with some others, a legally binding clause on social progress and a charter of public services, which will give precedence to social security and services of general interest over internal market regulations."
"From what you have said, I understand that you do not think much of this."
"In the Zimmermann report, the European Parliament calls for a minimum wage of at least 60% of the average income in all Member States."
"You maintain that you can do nothing about this."
"I think that you could, for example, by means of the employment policy guidelines."
"You are focusing solely on the Stability and Growth Pact which has proved to be an ineffective tool, in particular, during the crisis."
"We want a social pact to replace the Lisbon strategy and the Stability Pact."
"You believe that a few new financial supervision regulations will keep the greed of the financial world in check."
"We are calling for a ban on particularly risky forms of investment and a tax on capital movements."
"You, and I quote, 'support every paragraph of the Treaty of Lisbon'."
"We want a social Europe instead of a continuation of the radical focus on the internal market."
"We want a commitment to disarmament and civil conflict management instead of the continuing growth in military capability."
"You see Europe as a leading power and we want to spread the ideology of free trade and marketisation of all areas of life throughout the world."
"We stand for intercultural, multilateral dialogue and the greatest possible support for developing countries in overcoming the economic, food, financial and climate crisis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us elect a Commission together which sets itself the objective of a social, peaceful, economically sustainable and democratic European Union."
"If we want to gain acceptance among the people of Europe for the EU project, we need a break with radical free-market concepts and more direct democracy."
"In this case, Mr Barroso is the wrong man for the job of president."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I should like to ask Mr Barroso: why the unseemly haste?"
"Why change the rules of the game?"
"Why does your re-election for five years as Commission President have to take place now?"
"Well, of course, the answer is Ireland and the Lisbon Treaty."
"The plan is to show everybody that the ship is steady, that everything is going well, that all the Irish have to do is to correct their rather silly little mistake - and indeed your working document is written as if the Treaty were already ratified."
"But there is a rather important point being missed here: you have been the boss; you have been the governor for the last five years."
"You have been in charge of overseeing that the Constitutional Treaty was pushed through."
"But things went wrong, did they not?"
"The French said 'no' and the Dutch said 'no', but you refused to accept these democratic results and you took part, with many Members of this Parliament, in the absolute deceit that is the Lisbon Treaty."
"You told us that the flag and the anthem would be dropped, but I have not seen much evidence of that."
"No, you rebranded it as the Lisbon Treaty but you could not stop the Irish from voting, and the Irish said 'no'."
"But once again you could not accept a democratic result, oh no - the Irish have to vote again!"
"Where in all of this, given that you are in charge, is the principle of democratic accountability?"
"Well, you might argue that there is not much democracy left in the European Union now, but there should at least be some degree of accountability, and I would argue that, on the eve of what may well be a fourth rejection of this Treaty, the one that kills it off for good, this Parliament should not install you as Commission President for the next five years until we have that result."
"If the Irish people say 'no' for a second time, then we simply have to respect what they say, and you have to go as President of the Commission."
"It would happen in any other walk of life, it would happen in any business, and I suggest that it really ought to happen in European politics."
"And what about your record?"
"You have overseen the Lisbon Agenda: it was sunk without trace way before the credit crunch hit us."
"Now you are telling us we have to have a commissioner for immigration, taking away from nation states their most basic right to decide who comes to live, work and settle in their countries."
"You have pushed on with your obsession with climate change, which has led to massive costs and no material benefits whatsoever."
"But, above all, it is the fact that you ignored that Irish referendum, that you said the Irish cannot stop this Treaty: for that reason alone, I simply cannot support you."
"But it is possible that I have got this horribly wrong."
"It is possible that you are the right man after all, because yesterday in the Daily Telegraph, a poll asked: If Lisbon goes through without a referendum, would you want Britain to stay part of the European Union?"
"And by 43% to 26% - for the first time in over 30 years - a massive majority of Britons said they want us to leave this European Union if Mr Barroso gets his way."
"So maybe I got it wrong: maybe you are the right man."
"We will see."
"(Applause and laughter from certain quarters)"
"Yes, he is very happy to go!"
"(HU) Mr President, Europe has reached an historic turning point."
"Millions of people making a living from an honest day's work want a fundamental change."
"They want to combat the gross injustices of neoliberalism and global big capital."
"These include family farmers, smallholders, small business owners and government employees."
"To be able to do this, they are in huge need of human rights."
"I am sorry that the commissioner is not here now to hear me speaking in defence of human rights and civil liberties."
"These rights are necessary so that people can express their views, in other words, enjoy the freedom of opinion, the right to free assembly and freedom of speech without being labelled as fascists, as actually happened here today in this chamber, or shot in the eye, intimidated by police brutality, maltreated, put in prison or subjected to sham criminal proceedings."
"When all these events took place in Hungary in autumn 2006, we turned to you for you to do something."
"You did nothing."
"Why not?"
"I would ask Parliament's Vice-President, Mr Schmitt, to confirm what happened, why we turned to you."
"It was because of what happened at a meeting organised by the Fidesz party, a civic party..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Thank you, Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words in this discussion."
"I must say that it is wonderful to be back in the European Parliament."
"The discussion and speeches here are undeniably more dynamic and entertaining than back home in Sweden."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Barroso for giving us such a clear indication of the role that he would like the Commission to play and for his reform agenda for the next five years."
"I have also listened very carefully to what the group rapporteurs had to say."
"There is, of course, an awful lot I could comment on, but I will not do that today, because this is not the Council's debate."
"It is Parliament's debate with the President-designate of the Commission."
"As I mentioned, it is not my job to comment on what has been said, but I have listened very carefully to the debate."
"There are just two things I would like to say."
"The first thing is self-evident: José Manuel Barroso has been unanimously nominated by 27 Heads of State or Government with various political affiliations."
"He has our clear support to lead the Commission for another term."
"This does not, of course, reduce Parliament's duty to scrutinise him and take a decision as to whether to approve or not to approve him."
"My second comment is also self-evident, but it bears repeating."
"We are living in extremely uncertain times with considerable and difficult challenges."
"We need a strong Europe with an ability to take action and one in which the European Institutions function properly and are able to cooperate."
"We need certainty, clarity and stability, so that, together, we can tackle the issues for which our citizens expect results and on which they expect Europe to deliver."
"President-designate of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all let us address some issues of policy substance."
"The Commission does not and has never advocated the privatisation of public services."
"We believe public services are an important part of our European model of society."
"What we believe is important is that those public services work in the framework of a strong single market in respect of Community rules. This is very important."
"Let us be frank about it: sometimes some national politicians, when there is a problem, say it is the fault of Brussels and when they have success, say it is their merit."
"So please let us not embark on those accusations that it is because of Brussels that there is privatisation."
"These are national decisions."
"We have amongst our Member States some countries with some public services that they have decided to privatise but this is not an imposition of Brussels."
"I think that the usual exercise of Brussels-bashing goes too far sometimes."
"Everyone should assume their responsibilities."
"The second point is about posting of workers."
"The principles of the directive are indeed those that have been mentioned, namely by the Socialist Group: the respect for fundamental rights of workers;"
"I said it very often."
"For us, these are sacred rights: the right to strike; the right of association."
"Fundamental rights are something very important."
"I come from a country where there was a time when there were no civil rights or social rights, so I know what it means to have access to those social rights."
"At the same time, we are committed to the freedom of circulation in Europe."
"Without that freedom of circulation, we are not going to have a Europe."
"So let us try to reconcile both principles in a way."
"Let us not give into interpretations of the European Court of Justice."
"That is why I proposed here a way forward inspired by many of your suggestions and I am ready to work in loyalty with all the Members of this Parliament to achieve it so that we have a stronger Europe, keeping our internal market, but respecting fully the social rights of our workers."
"On regulation and deregulation, let me make the point very clear, and I ask you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, find a statement where I advocate deregulation."
"I have always said 'better regulation' or 'smart regulation'."
"It is not my fault if in French it is translated as 'deregulation'."
"Better legislation: mieux légiférer, not moins légiférer."
"(FR) And, Mr Cohn-Bendit, I wish to tell you something."
"You have an obsession with me."
"I do not have an obsession with you."
"On the contrary, I almost feel sympathy towards you because you remind me of my youth ..."
"(Applause)"
"There is one political issue that is very important."
"I may be criticised for many things, and I am the first to admit that there are issues on which myself and the Commission may be criticised."
"However, we must fulfil our commitment regarding climate change: everyone acknowledges that we are the world's leaders on this issue."
"I have received compliments, for the Commission, from President Obama, from the United Nations Secretary-General, and from the Nobel Prize winner, Mr Pachauri, who wrote me a touching letter."
"I will be the first to share this success for Europe with you, since the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has contributed to the agenda for green growth."
"Make no mistake: I am in favour of green growth;"
"I am not in favour of the decline of Europe."
"This is important."
"I am in favour of green growth, of viable growth, but I am not in favour of the deindustrialisation of Europe."
"I am not in favour of cutting our jobs in Europe."
"The fact is, it is the Commission that has done the most for climate change, and it is precisely the Commission that Mr Cohn-Bendit has made a scapegoat of since the beginning."
"Even before I have presented the guidelines and even before I have presented myself to your group, you have said 'No'."
"You have even made T-shirts."
"They have not sold well, the 'Stop Barroso' T-shirts."
"You speak of hallucinations, Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"Listen!"
"A party put forward a candidate before the elections."
"I myself heard your proposals."
"You proposed a UK conservative, Mr Patten."
"You even, I believe, put the French Prime Minister forward as a candidate, which shows ... but no, you did not, because I was thinking that that was yet another favour like the one you did Mr Sarkozy, by dividing the left in France."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, the truth is this: if we want to have a Europe that is closer to the citizens, we have to make our choices on the basis of policies."
"I should very much like the pro-European forces to support a pro-European programme."
"I have presented a very pro-European programme to you."
"It is up to you to vote for me."
"It is not I who decides who must support me."
"It is you who must vote."
"I have a pro-European programme, linked to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This may not be the best news for everyone, but I believe in it."
"I am proposing to you now a new ambition for Europe."
"Indeed, the last five years have been the years of consolidation of the enlarged Europe."
"I make no apology for having the support of the 27 Heads of State or Government, who were democratically elected and who are on all political sides, of course, because I believe that my role was essentially to bring people together."
"This is the first time that we have had this enlarged Europe."
"I make no apology for having loyally worked alongside these Heads of State or Government."
"It goes without saying that a re-elected President of the Commission will have increased authority."
"I call on you to give strong support to a Commission that is in favour of more ambition, of more determined progress, and of a European project of solidarity and freedom."
"I am offering you loyal cooperation."
"Some people have ruled themselves out of this."
"That is a shame!"
"I for my part am going to remain committed to my values, and even to the values that you at times defend."
"(Applause)"
"(Mr Cohn-Bendit held up a blue card)"
"I must explain."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit is holding up a blue card, but we discovered half an hour ago that the rule in question applies only to speakers who are Members of the European Parliament and not to speakers from outside Parliament, such as speakers from the Commission."
"Maybe we should change this in future, but for now we must observe the rules."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to change the tone of this debate and suggest that we all ask ourselves: Who among us does not need to grow and develop?"
"Who among us does not have scope for improvement?"
"Who among us never makes mistakes?"
"A new direction needs to be taken in many areas, not only by the Commission President, but also by us."
"There are many new paths for us to tread."
"I have the feeling that many people here are looking for one person to blame for the problems which face us, instead of working on solving our common problems with new strength, new ideas, enthusiasm and vision."
"Many people make insinuations and generate mistrust in order to divert attention from their own weaknesses."
"Many people are also ignoring the election results of 7 June 2009 which form the democratic basis for today's debate."
"We accuse the Commission President of doing things that he is obliged to do, in other words, adhering to the treaties and implementing the resolutions."
"Someone today uttered the fine statement: 'Without freedom there is no solidarity and without solidarity there is no strong, effective European Union.'"
"I would like to add: no strong European Commission."
"We are all in the same boat."
"All of us are jointly responsible."
"Each of us has his or her own share of responsibility."
"The Commission President has a great deal of the primary responsibility."
"However, as Martin Schulz said, this is not just about him."
"His strength depends on us, on the Member States, on the competence and quality of the Commissioners."
"That is the next chapter in our book."
"How will we implement an eco-social market economy?"
"How will we restructure the Commission?"
"How will we create a commissioner for financial markets?"
"What about the diplomatic service?"
"What about protecting the climate?"
"At the end of his speech, our President paraphrased a quotation from Bronisław Geremek: 'Let us all work hard in our own way and make the most of the opportunity to bring about change, rather than running each other down!'"
"Mr President, Mr Barroso might recall my intervention when he came before our group last week."
"As I said then, Mr Barroso, I read your political guidelines for the new Commission with considerable interest and I actually found that much of the rhetoric contained in the guidelines reflects my own beliefs and political priorities."
"I am sure of many others on the Left as well."
"The problem is, however, that you used pretty much the same rhetoric when you came here five years ago to look for the Commission Presidency then."
"At that time, you made a number of promises in relation to social Europe on renewing the social agenda for five years that have not been met."
"You might recall, for example, saying five years ago on services of general interest: 'I do not exclude the possibility of a framework directive'."
"Now five years later, as you have said again today, the EU might establish a 'quality framework for public and social services'."
"We are not quite sure what that means."
"We do know what a framework directive means and for us that is a very important commitment that we would like you to enter into."
"Telling us that you do not exclude the possibility of one is simply not enough this time."
"When we looked at your document last week, we looked for specific concrete commitments, but we found virtually none."
"What we did find - thanks to Google - is that the guidelines themselves, presented as a transformational agenda, are, by and large, nothing more than a recycling of existing Commission texts and the existing policy agenda."
"Three broad points on your guidelines:"
"Firstly, they simply do not address the seriousness of the severe unemployment and social crisis that we are facing and which will worsen in the months if not years to come."
"Secondly, we think your words about a crisis exit strategy are premature."
"You have modified that in what you have said to us today."
"But what we should be talking about is an entry strategy, a strategy for positive intervention in the labour market, not just at Member State level but at European level."
"Thirdly, your transformational agenda is the agenda of the past."
"The crisis is calling for much bolder and more far-sighted policies than you have in mind."
"Instead, what the number one priority of the new Commission must be is the launching of a modernised and ambitious new European social agenda."
"I have listened to what you have said very carefully again today on the response to the Laval judgment in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive."
"You have said again today that an implementing regulation, without touching the directive, is the way to go."
"That simply will not work."
"The problem is in the directive itself which repeats over and over again that 'Member States 'may'...'."
"Unless the implementing regulation replaces or overtakes that directive, the problem of Laval will remain."
"Also, forgive us if we judge you on your track record."
"Laval did not happen yesterday."
"What have you done in the almost two years since the Laval judgment sent shock waves through the trade union movement?"
"One final question: will you commit yourself today to doing everything possible to bring about a proper gender balance in the next College of the Commission?"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why now?"
"Why Mr Barroso?"
"These are the two questions which we need to answer."
"The question 'Why now?' has already been covered here."
"We are in the middle of a financial and economic crisis and the preconditions for strong economic growth and the creation of more jobs will not be established overnight."
"We need an effective Commission and we need a common, long-term European strategy."
"We cannot start work on this next year; we must begin immediately."
"This is why we also need to vote now."
"Why Mr Barroso?"
"I am pleased about the clear declaration by the Commission President, the candidate, on the social market economy, on competition and on the internal market."
"As liberals, we also have high expectations and demands."
"We expect that a common strategy will be developed jointly with the Member States."
"In the medium term, it will not be enough to have a network of regulators monitoring the financial markets."
"We need a single European financial supervisory body."
"As Guy Verhofstadt has just said, the mid-term review will be decisive for us."
"As liberals, we believe that the creation of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights is a positive move."
"We want him to have genuine authority."
"For anyone who does not know what is meant by this: data protection and the treatment of asylum seekers at Europe's external borders are both subjects which require more attention."
"I would like to say a few words about the comments made here on the political situation."
"I very much regret that the majority of social democrats will not be voting in your favour tomorrow."
"The social democrats are thus withdrawing from the pro-European alliance which we wanted to establish, particularly in the case of European policy issues."
"Mr Schulz, Mr Bisky and Mr Cohn-Bendit are organising a red/red/green blockade of Europe, or at least they are trying to."
"The decisive factor is as follows: we cannot defend ourselves against the agreement among the European conservatives, but it is crucial that the liberals and Christian democrats maintain Europe's ability to act."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the European Free Alliance members in the Greens/EFA Group."
"We believe in equality for all people in Europe."
"We support independence for the nations and the regions of Europe that are not currently Member States in their own right but that aspire to be, and we campaign for equal rights for speakers of all languages, whether they are official EU languages or co-official languages, and whether they are spoken by the majority or the minority in a Member State."
"Mr Barroso, you talk in your guidelines, and you have talked again today, about the need to create a feeling of connection between the EU and its citizens, but this can never be achieved until the EU recognises the real nations and peoples, and that subsidiarity operates at all levels and not just between the EU and the Member State government."
"If the European Union is to effectively support us through the economic crisis, lead the way as it must in fighting climate change, protect public services, defend human rights and contribute to international peace and disarmament, then it needs the input of all of us, and that includes Wales, Scotland, Catalonia, Corsica, Flanders and many others."
"Across Europe at this moment, there are discussions, consultations and referenda taking place, and I am not talking about Lisbon but about proposals for constitutional change and for greater autonomy in these countries."
"I regret that you have not acknowledged, recognised or addressed these current developments in your guidelines and you have not brought forward proposals for greater involvement of countries and regions which have legislative powers in EU decision making, something which we in the EFA see as crucial."
"I would ask you again to agree to do that."
"Mr President, one of the most corrosive criticisms of the EU is that it is more concerned with its own internal systems than in demonstrating leadership on global issues or acting in a way that adds value to citizens' lives."
"Nowhere has this tendency been more apparent than in the preposterous discussions we have been forced to endure over whether and when to appoint the President of the Commission."
"The anniversary today of the collapse of Lehman Brothers is a timely reminder of the parlous state of the European economy and especially that of the UK."
"Unemployment is on the increase wherever we look, and we are just weeks away from a crucial global summit on climate change."
"In these circumstances, it was absurd to seek to delay the appointment of the President of the Commission beyond September."
"I read President Barroso's political guidelines with great interest."
"I warmly welcome the opportunity the ECR Group had for a vigorous discussion with him on it."
"First, our central priority must be restarting economic growth and building long-term competitiveness."
"In the short term, this means less economic intervention, and resisting protectionism."
"Then we must ensure a return to sound public finances and work to secure further market liberalisation to restore trade and business confidence and ensure there is proper investment in skills and human capital, as well as in innovation and research."
"The Commission has a vital role to play in making sure the EU institutions do not undermine economic recovery through imposing unnecessary and excessive burdens on business."
"The work done by President Barroso and Commissioner Verheugen in this area has been significant."
"Tackling excessive regulation and promoting the 'better regulation' agenda - although, Mr Barroso, I myself would have preferred it to be called 'deregulation' - was an area of success of the last Commission."
"Nonetheless, it is regrettable this success was not more pronounced, and more work is certainly required."
"We need to have a senior Vice-President of the Commission responsible for this area of work."
"I urge you, President Barroso, to make such an appointment if you are elected tomorrow."
"On the issue of climate change, it is the case that the EU has shown leadership in international negotiations in this area and it must continue to do so."
"I welcome the emphasis President Barroso has placed on the need to show how fighting climate change can help to modernise our economies."
"Another area I wish to highlight is the commitment to reshape the EU budget with a root-and-branch reform."
"Such a reform is long overdue and it should have been a binding commitment."
"Although I, personally, and my group strongly support the renomination of the President and welcome some of the major elements, we do not see eye to eye on everything, as my friend Michał Kamiński has said."
"I have grave concerns about the Commission's reported plans in the field of immigration and asylum and, as far as the UK is concerned, retention of national control over our borders continues to be essential."
"As President Barroso knows from our discussions, there are problems with the Commission proposals in the field of financial supervision."
"There is a real risk that key financial businesses will relocate outside the EU to the benefit of no one other than our competitors."
"Lastly, there have been references throughout the debate to the Lisbon Treaty."
"I do not hide the fact, and confine myself to pointing out once again, that the EU has continued to function perfectly well without the Lisbon Treaty in the past three or four years."
"There is no reason why this could not continue to be the case."
"Finally, I quote a paragraph towards the end of President Barroso's manifesto."
"He said: 'The EU works best when it focuses on its core business."
"I want to concentrate our limited resources on where we can have most effect and where we can bring most added value.'"
"In other words, I think that means that the EU might do less, but it must do it better."
"President Barroso, if these were to be your watchwords in the next five years, it would be an excellent basis for progress but, in any event, you do deserve a resounding vote of support from us tomorrow."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, the institutions do not permit the left to put forward a candidate."
"We deplore this single-candidacy condition and the political agreements among right-wing and social-democrat governments that make it possible."
"Indeed, this condition denies the existence of a widely held opinion in Europe that is totally opposed to the liberal model of European integration that you embody."
"This is the model which, without your saying a single word about it, plunges the European ideal into the depths of hostile abstentions from the European elections, in particular, and that is remarkable, in the new Member States."
"This is the model that has turned the dream of a protective Europe into a machine for destroying our social rights and our national industries, and which makes peoples compete against one another in order to earn a living."
"More and more people are saying: 'Nothing good comes of Europe'."
"You did not see the financial disaster and the environmental catastrophe coming, despite all the warnings, because there were warnings."
"You helped them happen - you, and the others - with this dictatorship of free and fair competition, which is crippling our societies and destroying their public spirit and our public services."
"Now, you are changing the words but not the deeds."
"However, your programme can be summed up in one sentence - I do not know whether the French pun can be translated - which is: 'Henceforth it will be the same as before'."
"It is, however, a great change that Europe needs in order to turn the page on an epoch, on an archaic and bygone era, that of financial capitalism and maximum productivity."
"The change could therefore begin by the refusal to invest you with the presidency."
"That is why our delegation will deny you its vote."
"(FI) Mr President, President Barroso, you came to see our Eurosceptic group and we appreciate that."
"It was time to discuss issues and you had some tough questions, from me among others."
"The fact that there is only one candidate, however, does not appeal to me."
"Moreover, if we do not accept you now, will it be how it was in Ireland, with Mr Barroso coming along in a couple of months' time wearing a different tie and then everyone voting again on the same thing?"
"You like the Commission."
"I have read this document very carefully."
"You say in it that the Commission is irreplaceable and that it is only the Commission which has the authority to put forward proposals which take the interests of all our citizens into account, and that only the Commission has competence and independence."
"Ladies and gentlemen, where are the nations of Europe?"
"Where are the parliaments of Europe and where are the European voters?"
"Do they not say that it is for them that this Union is kept on its feet?"
"I do not actually believe in that very much."
"Mr Barroso, stand up for the working man, stand up for the workers, because the tired Left can no longer do that."
"Stand up for the small entrepreneurs: we have no shortage of labour; we have a shortage of employers."
"Do good work from the bottom up, so that people are able to employ others, and this way Europe can move forward."
"Finally, President Barroso, no EU taxes, thank you; we already have enough taxes."
"(Applause)"
"(ES) Mr President, I wish to direct my comments to Mr Barroso."
"Mr Barroso, I have listened to you with great interest, and also great respect, for a very long time, in fact since you were a politician in a country that is very close to us and our hearts, namely Portugal."
"However, you have just totally surprised me."
"There are two reasons for this: firstly, you have demonstrated contempt for the group to which I belong - the group of Non-attached members - by not giving us even a minute of your time to explain your political proposals."
"We represent many European citizens and you have demonstrated contempt for all our voters."
"Secondly, your political plan is weak and your political proposals in the document 'Political guidelines for the next Commission' are poor."
"These proposals do not even include what you yourself have defended during your term as Commission President."
"I am surprised that issues such as energy which, throughout your term of office, have been well handled, are now, when you are offering your proposals for the next ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, President Barroso, I shall begin by offering you my congratulations."
"I congratulate you first on your five years of work at the head of the Commission, in which you have shown firmness in dealing with the Member States, as on the climate and energy question, and an ability to generate compromise and consensus, as on the financial perspective, despite the added difficulties resulting from enlargement, the institutional crisis and the international financial crisis."
"Secondly, I congratulate you on the political guidelines for the next Commission that you have presented to this Parliament."
"Unfortunately, President Barroso, in a democracy you cannot please everyone."
"Some people do not like you because you are too European, and others because of ideological prejudice."
"Other people compare you with the past, forgetting that today there are 27 Member States whose interests have to be reconciled, not just 12 any more, and that, fortunately, this Parliament has greater power and interinstitutional cooperation is more demanding."
"Others want to postpone the decision."
"Postponing it would create a vacuum and would weaken both the Commission and Europe."
"The world is not waiting for us."
"Just yesterday, the President of Brazil made a statement that threw the G8 into the wastebasket of history and supported the G20."
"The world is not standing still while Europe sets its house in order and elects its leaders."
"Postponing a decision would be to accept that Europe is irrelevant in a more global world."
"I am naturally proud that a Portuguese is presiding over the European Commission, but my support is not just an expression of national solidarity."
"It represents my acknowledgment of the work that you have done, and my agreement with your priorities, which I make mine: economic growth; investment in innovation, training and fighting unemployment; an emphasis on the importance of economic and social cohesion; investment in the environment and the fight against climate change; greater security without curbing freedom; and a strengthening of citizenship and civic participation."
"I welcome what you have just proposed to us regarding working together, bringing this Parliament and your Commission closer together for the sake of our common Europe."
"It is time for this Parliament to give the Heads of State of different political families a reason to unanimously reappoint you to head the Commission."
"Good luck, President Barroso, and success in your work."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, I fought my election campaign as the leading social democratic candidate in Austria on the basis of strong European regulation of the financial markets, a change in the Posting of Workers Directive, the protection of public services and an assessment of the social impact of legislation."
"As none of this was achieved by the previous Commission, of which you were head, I have worked on the assumption that we need a new Commission and a new Commission President."
"Now you are saying that you will do everything I have asked for."
"How can we suddenly start believing what you say?"
"My colleague, Stephen Hughes, has already referred to the fact that the first Barroso Commission has failed to deliver much of what you had already promised."
"In the next few weeks, you will have the time to prove that you really take this seriously."
"In this case, taking it seriously means having the support of the people who want to implement these measures."
"It has already been made clear that tomorrow you will receive support from many people who have nothing to do with these substantive objectives."
"You will receive a lot of support from those Members of Parliament who have prevented these objectives from being achieved or have rejected these objectives, for example, in the case of the Posting of Workers Directive and the public services measures, and who have been strongly in favour of privatisation."
"These Members will support you tomorrow."
"You must prove that you can form a new majority in the Commission which really wants to achieve these objectives."
"In answer to Mr Lambsdorff, who says that this can only be a German election campaign and that the social democrats are leaving the European path, I would like to say that it is not the social democrats, but you who are entering into an alliance with genuine anti-Europeans and that is the problem."
"Many of us would be prepared to support you, if the Commission had a clear position on the social dimension."
"We note the promises that you have made today, but we also expect a decision which will indicate that the matters that I have referred to today will be taken seriously in the policy of the future Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, in this House there are MEPs, including myself, who will not be placing their confidence in you in tomorrow's vote."
"I wish to state here the reasons for this decision, and also to voice our concerns to you, because I believe that they deserve to be heard."
"We believe that the Commission is rather less strong today than it was five years ago."
"We believe that, too often, it has deliberately chosen to give way to the Council, so as not to upset anyone."
"We also believe that it has been unable to use the power conferred on it by the Treaties, this right of initiative which, in times of crisis, should be a real duty of initiative."
"We believe, finally, that the Commission is no longer the place where the European general interest is formed, so as to make itself heard by one and all, and that none of this is good for Europe."
"This Europe needs a vision, it needs powers to think and to produce a new development model, and it needs new solutions to economic issues: how can we achieve more industrial and budgetary integration; how can we prioritise the long term over the short term; how can we ensure, for example, that the banks are there, firstly, to support businesses, households and European investors in the area of regulation; how can we put in place a European regulator who can discuss social issues on an equal footing with his or her US counterpart; how can we implement a pact on employment; how can we achieve more upwards harmonisation in the monetary field; how can we use and demonstrate solidarity; how can we achieve, in the future perhaps, a further enlargement of the euro area, including in the area of sustainable development; and how can we make this transition work, not only in Europe but also in developing countries?"
"There, Mr Barroso, are some of the questions facing you."
"This is why I believe that we need a Commission that can revive the European general interest and its vision, quite simply to restore meaning to the idea of Europe."
"It is on this basis that we shall judge your future actions."
"Thank you for listening."
"(DE) Mr President, the depth of the crisis in Europe was caused not simply by unethical behaviour on the financial markets, Mr Barroso."
"Other causes include growing social inequality, dangerous macro-economic imbalances between the Member States, which led to a lack of solidarity, and Europe's dependency on rising resource prices."
"The citizens of Europe deserve a Commission which repeatedly puts these deeper causes back on the agenda instead of turning them into taboos, instead of doing the opposite and instead of shifting the responsibility on to the Member States."
"We need properly coordinated economic and fiscal policies in Europe."
"We need collaboration on tax in Europe, which will put an end to tax dumping."
"Only then will it be possible to stop the spread of social divisions and to finance the environmentally friendly investments that are needed."
"We need a policy which consistently promotes green technologies and lifestyles in order to bring about a rapid reduction in the EU's dependence on finite resources."
"This will represent a green environmental revolution."
"I cannot find any of these things in your programme, Mr Barroso, which is why I cannot vote for you."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President, Mr Barroso, for years, some of the smaller new Member States had already maintained a fixed exchange rate for their national currency against the euro before joining the European Union."
"This allowed the European Union financial sector to invest most profitably in those countries."
"However, at this time of crisis, for these countries to preserve this strict exchange rate results in a socially dramatic devaluation of people's incomes and in speculative attacks on the foreign currency reserves of those countries' central banks."
"This costs both their citizens and the European Commission, as the lender of this money, dear."
"A speedier introduction of the euro in these countries would reduce these costs and create stability."
"That is why, Mr Barroso, I should like to see you promote an application of the Maastricht criteria appropriate to these times of crisis with as much zeal as you defend the Treaty of Lisbon. Thank you."
"Mr President, I opposed the nomination of Mr Barroso as President of the Commission."
"Mr Barroso is using the EU Commission to interfere with the democratic right of the Irish people to freely decide to accept or reject the Lisbon Treaty in a referendum on 2 October."
"With great cynicism, his Commission has sent employees of the Commission into schools all over Ireland in recent days to speak, supposedly, of how good the Commission of the European Union is - in reality a signal to their parents that they should vote 'yes' for Lisbon."
"Moreover, a senior civil servant of the Commission has openly participated in public rallies of organisations campaigning for the Lisbon Treaty."
"Like Caesar Augustus, Mr Barroso is sending his emissaries to tell the Irish people what they should do."
"We will embark on democratic debate with anybody, but it is a gross abuse of taxpayers' funds that civil servants should intervene on one side of this debate."
"(GA) Mr Barroso's policies are not at all for the benefit of the European workforce and the Lisbon Treaty is not for the benefit of the European workforce, but rather it promotes militarisation and privatisation and, as a result, we will not accept Mr Barroso as president from now on."
"Mr President, President Barroso espouses a Europe of ambition."
"The EU has certainly achieved that: 27 states in 50 years, and the Lisbon Treaty - if ratified by Ireland - will mark the death of their national sovereignty and the launch pad for the European Union takeover."
"But we in UKIP reject Mr Barroso's plan for European integration because we know that individual Member States are not an irrelevance."
"National sovereignty is the bedrock of our values and the cornerstone of the United Kingdom's democracy."
"In the EU, human rights - whether individual or collective - take second place to solidarity for Europeans."
"The two are directly incompatible, yet President Barroso puts them together at the centre of his vision of the EU for the next five years, with solidarity as the cornerstone for European society."
"We in UKIP prefer sovereignty to solidarity."
"When Member States' citizens express views in national referendums, the result should be final, respecting their rights to their opinions, but the EU's version of citizens' rights is to make them vote and vote again in national referendums until they can cave in to the pressure and vote 'yes'."
"This is how the Maastricht Treaty and the Nice Treaty were achieved, and now the EU is following the same tactic and forcing Ireland to vote again on the Lisbon Treaty when it has already rejected it, as did France and the Netherlands."
"What kind of rights are these, when they are rejected out of hand in the name of solidarity?"
"UKIP places sovereignty and the citizen's rights above solidarity."
"We reject the Lisbon Treaty and President Barroso's vision of it."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy."
"Mr Barroso, just imagine you were to stand for election in Europe, just you and no other candidate."
"What percentage of the votes would you receive?"
"What would the citizens do?"
"They would probably have listened to you today and seen that you promised everything to everyone."
"Hopefully, they would also find out what you did five years ago."
"That was when you promised most people a very great deal."
"It is a question of comparing what you promised then with what you are promising now and with what can be expected."
"I believe that is very, very little."
"You represent the old Europe, the botched Europe, the contribution to the financial crisis, as a result of the failure on the part of the Commission, the lack of commitment to climate issues, and so on and so forth."
"I would be on the side of the majority of European citizens, because I believe that you would not get more than 10 or 12 or 15% of the votes."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say in advance that the German conservative (CDU/CSU) Members of Parliament will support you, Mr Barroso, in your bid for a second period of office."
"However, we do have specific expectations of you and, of course, of the future Commission during this second period of office."
"I want to make that quite clear."
"Our demands are focused on the future but, of course, we have five years' experience behind us and therefore I would like to highlight briefly the changes we would like to see."
"In our opinion, the last five years have brought high points and low points."
"The low points included the lack of regulation of the financial markets, because the Commission lacked the courage to take the necessary measures against individual Member States which were blocking progress, the noticeable increase in the power of the Council, and the high-handedness of individual Commissioners who have disregarded the concept of subsidiarity."
"We will lend our support to your programme and your guidelines, because we believe that they represent the right approach."
"We want to ensure that some of the things that are important to us are achieved and I am sure that you will take that into account."
"Firstly, the model of a social market economy must be the basis of our common policy in Europe, in other words, freedom and responsibility and not just the freedom which was to be found on the financial markets."
"The competitiveness of Europe and job security in Europe have to be weighed up against protecting the environment and the climate."
"I was rather surprised that you are potentially putting this overall approach at risk by appointing a separate climate commissioner."
"We need an industrial base in Europe and the problems of the world, such as hunger, poverty and disease, can only be solved if Europe is a strong economic power with a base of this kind."
"The citizens must lend their support to Europe."
"Over-regulation is significantly reducing people's motivation and alienating them from the concept of Europe, which is why we want an independent assessment of the impact of legislation."
"Fourthly and finally, we want a fundamentally new version of the interinstitutional agreements."
"Under these conditions, the five-year period of office will be a positive one."
"Mr President, one could not ask a Popular Party politician to be a Socialist, nor a Socialist to vote for a Popular Party politician."
"It would be as simple as that, if it were not much more complicated."
"Why do we feel somehow embarrassed and divided, however, when asked to support your candidacy?"
"Let us be frank."
"The list of disappointments and failures during the term of office of this Commission is far too long, as is that of the unaccomplished promises and initiatives."
"Consequently, our European citizens not only lost trust in the European institutions but also their hopes and passions."
"In complete fairness, we must also admit that you cannot be held solely responsible for that."
"The prime responsibility should lie with the national political leaders who always nationalised the achievements and Europeanised the defeats, and who mostly gave priority to national egoism over European solidarity."
"Many of your Commissioners, Socialists included, and provided by the same national leaders, are also responsible for lacking enough vision, courage, competence and will."
"Thus, today we are not just confronting you but those nominating you as the only candidate for one of the most important European positions."
"Obviously, they did not do so out of respect for your qualities and strengths, but for what they consider to be your weaknesses."
"Not because they believe you will work for the achievement of an ever closer union with a powerful social appeal, but because they think you will call them individually to ask for their national blessing in advance of each European Commission initiative."
"It is paradoxical, at least, that today, the European Parliament as a communitarian institution, rather than consolidating the democratic legitimacy of the future president of the communitarian institution that is the Commission with an overwhelming 'yes', should, through this candidate, challenge the intergovernmental institution that is the Council."
"Therefore, at the end of this process of our vote for the college, it will be important if you could prove that you are one of us and not one of them."
"Mr President, President Barroso should be congratulated for his staunch support for the treaty change agenda throughout his previous term."
"I think he should also be thanked for publishing a good programme of stability plus necessary proposals for improvement in the challenging policy sectors that we all agree upon."
"But I have to say that, as GDP sinks and as our spending increases, we are facing, across the period to 2014, the prospect of a fresh budgetary crisis, and at that time, I do trust that President Barroso will be firmly on the side of Parliament and is going to oppose the position that we can foresee will be the position of national treasuries."
"The fact is that the Union requires a larger budget and a budgetary policy crafted to promote economic recovery."
"National spending should be transferred to the European budget in places where there are clear cost efficiencies, economies of scale and value added, and where market failure requires stronger European policies to correct it."
"We must resource the budget by means of an independent and more progressive and transparent system."
"(DE) Mr President, I am, of course, not referring to the previous speaker, but I would ask you to be fair when interrupting speakers who have exceeded their speaking time."
"You cut off some people dramatically and let others run over for a very long time."
"That is not acceptable."
"Mr President, I just want to clarify that Ireland is not having to vote again because someone has said so: the Irish people are voting again because they have decided to do so of their own accord, and they will take their own decision."
"Secondly, the vote now is different to the last time."
"We have guarantees that clarify matters for the Irish people, and we also have a guarantee that we can keep our Commissioner."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Kelly, I am sorry but this is a new procedure but we have to apply it correctly."
"It applies only to questions to the previous speaker, not for statements."
"Apologies for cutting you off."
"President-designate of the Commission. - Mr President, I will start with issues of policy, then politics if I have the time."
"Regarding Mr Hughes' questions, I think it is important to clarify those issues that are very important for your group and for me, and for our commitment to a social market economy."
"On the posting of workers, my commitment to a regulation is intended to address the very problem you highlighted, Mr Hughes."
"The implementation and interpretation issues that have created uncertainty are the problem."
"I remind you that a regulation is directly applicable and will take less time than overall revision of the directive."
"In any case, I have said that, if necessary, we can look at revising the directive."
"On Laval, Commissioner Špidla, a member of your Socialist family, has, in agreement with me, conducted a very complete search for practical solutions."
"You must be aware that the problems you raised do not arise in all Member States."
"The diversity of labour law in the Member States means that a Laval situation can arise in some Member States but not in others."
"You, of all people, know that Member States, social partners and trade unions stick to their labour law acquis."
"We needed to fully assess the situation to make sure that the remedy was not going to create a bigger problem than the one it set out to solve."
"Mr Špidla has carried out that analysis, and that is why I can now propose a solution, trying to get a broad agreement in this Parliament."
"On public services, Mr Hughes asked why the Commission has not yet proposed a framework directive."
"I will point out that my Commission has done very important legal work on clarifying the application of state aid rules to public services."
"That was the most important issue five years ago, and the truth is that these clarifications have taken much of the heat out of the age-old debate on public services in the internal market."
"I did not say that there are no more problems."
"On the contrary, I recognise them."
"I am committed to completely assessing the situation and I will not hesitate, if necessary, to go further."
"I have made an honest and loyal offer in discussions with your group, and I look forward to working on it with you, including on the appropriate legal instruments."
"On gender balance, I am committed to this and my Commission has a record number of women."
"I can tell you very frankly that it was a very hard fight to get some Member States to send competent women to the Commission because they did not want to send women."
"As you know, the initiative on that comes from the Member States."
"I am committed to doing my best once again. I remember the first Delors Commission had no women and the second had only one."
"At one time I had nine women members of the Commission, which I believe is very important."
"I nominated the first woman ever as Secretary-General - the most important civil servant in the Commission - so I am very committed to that issue and I need your support there."
"Once again, however, please also work with your Member States so that they do not resort to this routine, because for 50 years, some Member States were incapable of making one single proposal for a woman for the Commission."
"Regarding the issue of social matters, let us put this bluntly."
"If you want to attack the caricature of Mr Barroso, then do so, but you know very well that I have often made proposals that were refused by the Council - including, by the way, some governments from your family."
"Let us be honest about it."
"At the last European Council, I proposed that we no longer have cofinancing for the Social Fund for those countries that do not have this possibility, namely the new Member States that are having difficulties."
"I made that proposal."
"It was refused by several governments, including some whose leadership, or whose finance minister, is from your party."
"So I completely disagree."
"It is not intellectually honest to attack the Commission all the time."
"You are missing the target."
"It is easier for you, but the reality is that we are pushing hard."
"After that Council, I put a proposal on the table - that is now being considered by the Council - to suspend the Social Fund cofinancing rules for countries that are in difficulties."
"I am committed to social cohesion."
"How could I not be committed, coming from a country like Portugal that benefits so much from the European Union?"
"I am committed to social and economic cohesion, and that is why I believe this caricature that some try to present is damaging Europe."
"I agree with what Mr Lambsdorff said before."
"I would prefer to have the support of the main pro-European political families, but some are excluding themselves from that."
"That is your choice, not mine."
"I want to bring the broadest possible consensus and exclude nobody."
"Let us be frank: in the history of European integration, it is not only the EPP, not only the Socialists, not only the Liberals, who have made great contributions."
"From Lord Cockfield, a Conservative, to a Communist like Altiero Spinelli, to the Green movement, there have been many contributions to our European integration."
"After the election, and with this diversity of views, it is important that we work together for Europe."
"We need a strong Europe, but there is a contradiction there."
"On the one hand, you say that you want a strong Europe, you want a strong Commission, you want me to stand up to some Member States that are going national, but at the same time you say 'We are not going to vote for you."
"We are going to reduce your influence."
"We are going to weaken you in front of the Member States'."
"There is a contradiction there, so let us be honest about it."
"If you want a strong Commission that has all the rights and initiative to defend European interests, at least give me the benefit of the doubt."
"We are living in difficult times and I have made an honest offer to you, a loyal offer to all Members of the Parliament, in full transparency."
"You cannot say that I am saying different things to different groups because this is the same programme I am presenting to all of you."
"Today I have added some complements and clarifications, but it is the same programme."
"Of course it is a compromise, but Europe only works as a compromise."
"Europe cannot work on fanaticism, or on dogmatism."
"I thank the EPP for the support it has given me."
"I am really grateful for the support you have given me, but the EPP was the first to say that they do not want this because it is alone."
"No party has a majority alone, so we have to build a consensus in Europe."
"Building this consensus in Europe is critically important."
"Of course we keep our ideological differences and keep up the political debate, but we make an effort to have a stronger Europe."
"I am committed to that."
"Are you?"
"That is my question."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso did not reply to my charge of interference by the Commission in the democratic process in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Barroso, I have a problem which means that I am not going to vote for you tomorrow, but you know what it is, since my group has explained it well."
"It is a political issue."
"You do not have a project for transforming Europe environmentally and socially."
"And yet that is, I believe, what needs to be done today."
"However, as Mr Daul elegantly put it, it was the right that won the elections, therefore you are on the right."
"The situation is clear."
"I should like, however, to be able to have respect for the President of the Commission, but I have a problem with this: when I see you, I inevitably think - and I assure you this is true - of your responsibility in the CIA's secret flights."
"Between 2002 and 2006, 728 people were transferred to Guantánamo via Portuguese airspace."
"You were minister from 2002 to 2004."
"I therefore cannot believe you, Mr Barroso, when you make declamations about Europe being a champion of human rights."
"What I expect from you - what I hope for from you, because I would like, in the future, to respect you as President of the Commission - is not your memoirs, in however many years' time, but that you will acknowledge your responsibilities in this serious act, which casts a shadow over European values."
"Mr President, there is a saying that if you are not at the table, you are on the menu."
"The next decade will decide where Europe is going to be."
"The current leading generation in Western Europe had a holiday from history."
"We grew up in peace."
"We grew up in a welfare state."
"We made debts and passed them on to our children. But history is knocking on our door."
"We will have a sluggish economy for years to come; we are facing mounting immigration and are sustaining an ageing population."
"Unfortunately, Europe does not have a culture of achievement."
"The European dream is to retire to the French Riviera as soon as possible."
"If we do not innovate and develop an entrepreneurial culture as you designed, Europe will be on the menu."
"I count on your leadership."
"May I give you one piece of advice: keep Europe focused on its core task."
"If you fail there, you will fail everywhere."
"Remain open-minded and do not propose a European tax because it will provoke a pitchfork revolution against Europe."
"I have never seen a demonstration in favour of a European tax."
"It is simply a bridge too far and you will only feed public anger."
"I count on your sense of realism to get Europe at the table and not on it, and I wish you good luck in your second term."
"(DE) Mr President, we are aware that Mr Barroso is a walking compromise between the powers of Europe."
"We know also that he is the lowest common denominator among the governments of the Member States."
"We know that Mr Barroso also has something to offer for everyone: a hint of Maoism for those on the left, a touch of conservatism for the members of the Christian Social party, a smattering of neo-liberalism, plus a green and socialist approach."
"Mr Barroso will, of course, stand as a candidate without opposition, without an alternative."
"For this reason, he is now having a few tough days and having to listen to unpleasant remarks from the united left and from other critics."
"However, this will pay off, because we know that after these tough days, Mr Barroso will probably once again be Commission President and that there will, once again, be uneasy compromises between the large and powerful groups in this House, but also between the governments in the Council, and that Mr Barroso, who has personified the failures of European integration during the last five years, is likely to continue to do so over the next five years."
"When it comes down to it, we all have very little influence."
"Mr President, let me start by saying that we support President Barroso's European ambition and his programme, and I say that on behalf of 28 Polish MEPs, if not more."
"There is one thing in this programme, however, which is especially close to our hearts, and that is energy security."
"You know, President Barroso, that this House is very much attached to this issue."
"We need to revisit and reassess both the progress and the deficiencies in this process and to set priorities for the coming months and years."
"The present situation is not satisfactory, but rather grey, because, in spite of all the declarations and apparent goodwill, the progress made in terms of energy infrastructure and crisis mechanisms is far from sufficient."
"The measures taken are not fulfilling all expectations and are still not satisfactory."
"We obviously welcome the short-term measures set by the Commission and Presidency, but we expect a long-term vision and determination from the Commission President and, if necessary, for the President of the Commission to face or challenge the inertia and egoism of the Member States."
"We need a strong Commission and strong leadership from you because we need the Commission to act on behalf of the whole Union and in the interests of the Union's citizens."
"Let me emphasise that such leadership should be based on a consensus that you have to lead and build in the Parliament and Commission as well as in the Member States."
"As you know, this idea was launched here in Parliament three years ago, but there is still a long way to go and we still have to wait for this dream to come true."
"I hope that by the end of this legislature, President Barroso, you will make this miracle happen and that you will be given the chance to do so."
"In this expectation, we support your candidature and keep our fingers crossed for your Presidency."
"(SV) Mr President, Mr Barroso, you said in your introduction that Europe and the world have suffered a crisis of values."
"Why do you not use plain language?"
"What we have suffered is, of course, a crisis for radical market thinking, for which you and your group are among the primary advocates."
"I promised my voters that I would not vote for you - as many other Social Democrats have done - if you do not guarantee that the Posting of Workers Directive will be amended to strengthen the rights of workers."
"Now I hear you trying to sound as if you have complied with this request."
"However, you say that this request will not be complied with by amending the directive, but by means of a new regulation, which we know to be completely inadequate."
"At the same time, I hear you painting an erroneous picture of the consequences of these amendments to the Posting of Workers Directive."
"You have been asked about this before and you have been evasive every time."
"I will ask you again: will you take action to amend the Posting of Workers Directive, so that European workers receive equal pay for equal work throughout the EU instead of experiencing the wage dumping that we are currently suffering throughout Europe?"
"(SV) Mr President, Europe today is a continent defined by peace and democracy."
"This was not the case 70 years ago when Europe was at war."
"This was not the case 20 years ago, either, when Europe was divided into East and West."
"Our generation has a responsibility to manage our continent and preserve and strengthen an open and democratic Europe."
"Mr Barroso, you have a special responsibility."
"Europe needs clear leadership and an EU that is both visible and there for the people of Europe in hard times as well as good ones."
"We need a leadership that listens."
"You need to do more in this regard."
"I would like to see more of the commitment that we have seen today, more of the José Manuel Barroso that we have seen today."
"Tomorrow you will receive the support of the Liberal Party of Sweden - Cecilia Malmström's party, not because we agree with you on everything, but because we believe that you can do more than you have shown us thus far."
"Here are some guiding principles for the continuation of your work."
"Protectionism is an abomination - even for a former Maoist."
"The strength of the EU lies in its open borders and free trade."
"Human rights apply to everyone, wherever they are."
"You need to do more in this regard."
"The economic crisis cries out for a global new order, with balanced regulations enabling us to deal with the climate crisis."
"Free Europe's farmers and give consumers and the market a chance."
"The EU does not need more institutional power struggles."
"Preserve us from that fate!"
"Europe has had enough of lame ducks."
"Mr Barroso, tomorrow, you will hopefully have the opportunity to establish a new Commission."
"I hope that you will then ensure that there are as many women as men in the new Commission."
"(EL) Mr Barroso, as you know, you have made no mention whatsoever of your position on issues such as the protection of biodiversity or your commitments pursuant to the Millennium Goals and the European Union's sustainable development strategy."
"I shall focus on the meaning of flexicurity, which you often use to combine flexibility and security."
"This concept appears to harbour serious dangers in terms of worker protection."
"Part-time employment, for example, is fine when it is the worker's choice."
"However, forced employment, where the worker has no choice, but is perhaps unable to find a job, looks like part-time unemployment."
"There is a similar problem with forced employment in jobs and with working times that have an adverse impact on citizens' personal lives and their quality of life."
"If you are elected, what political guidelines do you intend to issue on these matters, in cases which concern you?"
"Also, why do you not mention specific targets for green professions and other such initiatives, not so that you become 'green', but so that you at least indicate which way is the way out of the crisis?"
"(RO) Mr Barroso, I read your document but, quite frankly, I will vote for you tomorrow because I believe that Europe needs a religious Christian man like yourself, with this kind of upbringing."
"I think that you will be President of the Commission tomorrow and I urge you, Mr Barroso, to ask God to give you what he gave to Solomon: the wisdom to lead the European Commission."
"Please God."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian delegation of the European People's Party will support you, Mr Barroso, with our customary respect, our customary friendship and our customary loyalty."
"Nevertheless, we call on you to show more courage to enable our institutions to face the momentous times which we are experiencing, and to focus not only on the legitimate concerns of the governments, but first and foremost on the needs of the young generations, their desire to set up a home, have a family and have children: basically, the courage to fight for a true Europe, one underpinned by our sense of responsibility and not by our political mix."
"That is why I am calling on my fellow Socialist Members to show the same courage."
"Of course, electing Mr Barroso again may be a stopgap measure for the crisis of consensus, which is clearly shown by the outcome of the elections, but a yes vote, albeit a yes vote with conditions attached for the candidate for Commission President, would also give you all an opportunity to play your part at this difficult time, and send a clear signal to the European public, namely, that what unites us is stronger than what divides us, and that only in this way, together, can we help each other out of the abyss."
"In short, it is not just a yes to Mr Barroso but a yes to a clear and simple recipe: a Commission created with a contribution from all of you means that that Commission will be more independent, more efficient, stronger and, in other words, more European."
"(SK) I would like to discuss a topic which is causing concern to many people in the European Union, including myself."
"Our economies are going through a very difficult period, a period of crisis, the impact of which is being felt by so-called ordinary people in particular."
"These people are fighting for their work, for their existence and for their children, and it is precisely this fear and worry which creates such fertile ground for the growth of far-right extremism in the EU and in the Member States."
"In the past, far-right extremists concealed their faces under various different masks and guises."
"Today they parade through public squares and speak openly to the media."
"In addition, these people, who spread hatred against Roma, Jews, immigrants and homosexuals, are establishing political parties and, unfortunately, are successfully fielding candidates both for national parliaments and for the European Parliament during this difficult period."
"Finally, it was not so long ago that we witnessed even here, on the floor of this democratic institution, here in the European Parliament, the arrival or rather the marching in of certain MEPs in uniforms reminiscent of the fascist period of the Second World War."
"I would therefore like to ask you, Mr President, what sort of measures need to be adopted in the future, in respect of your role and the Commission as an authority, against such an abuse of the European Parliament and especially in the actual fight against extremism."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso observed that we are living in extraordinary times - true - but extraordinary times call for extraordinary leadership."
"Are you that leader, Mr Barroso?"
"I did not support you back in 2004 and unfortunately, in five years, you have not done enough to convince me."
"A majority of my group, however, is willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, but we will reserve our final judgment until we have seen the full package of commissioners' portfolios and the full details of your political programme, because do not forget, and I hope you hear the irony in this, that the President of the European Commission is a politician, and not a civil servant with job security."
"Regardless of the outcome of the votes, this process has strengthened European parliamentary democracy because, contrary to what some in this House fear, obliging a candidate to campaign has not weakened but strengthened the position of Commission President."
"Because, the way I see it, a mandate by the European Parliament for a political programme is a much more solid base than a nomination on the basis of a backroom deal between national governments."
"I also happen to believe, contrary to you, if I listened carefully, that the emergence of a real opposition in this House is very welcome and a healthy sign that European parliamentary democracy is vital and mature."
"So, Mr Barroso, the ball is in your court."
"Will you meet the challenge?"
"Because you have not convinced me yet."
"But that is not nearly as relevant, Mr Barroso, as convincing the European citizens in the next five years."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Madam President."
"Mr Barroso, when the credit crunch broke, you did nothing."
"It was the French Presidency that found the way to the emergency exit. You did not take back the reins: not with your European Economic Recovery Plan - you failed to make State aid to the car industry subject to strict environmental conditions - nor with a proposal for better financial supervision: you capitulated at the outset in the face of opposition from the City of London."
"The EU did hold the reins in the global approach to the climate crisis, but you are rapidly throwing them away."
"You are threatening to buy most of our CO2 reductions from developing countries instead of ensuring we emit less ourselves."
"You could blame national governments for this, but not for last week's appallingly meagre proposal of climate aid to developing countries: EUR 2 billion."
"This is peanuts compared to the EUR 30-35 billion Europe ought to be providing."
"In so doing, you are severely hampering Copenhagen's chances of success."
"There is the credit crunch, the economic crisis, the climate crisis - three tests of genuine leadership."
"Mr Barroso, three times you have failed to make the grade."
"Madam President, as a new Member of this House, I have listened to the many speakers who have focussed on Mr Barroso's track record in office and have voiced many concerns."
"Many I agree with."
"Our paths diverge completely on the Lisbon Treaty, Mr Barroso."
"However, you have taken a great interest in my constituency of Northern Ireland. For this commitment I thank you."
"We value the support and close working relationship of Commission officials at all levels with Northern Ireland."
"I look forward to this relationship continuing and my constituency benefiting from it."
"You will know about our past: the impact of violence on investment, and the need for new roads and rail links."
"You will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism."
"To aid our economic development I would urge the Commission to examine what resources will be made available to redress the years of underinvestment."
"As many in this Chamber have said already today, it is actions and delivery that count."
"(ES) Madam President, Commission President, I want to make a preliminary comment."
"We cannot have the same debate after elections as before elections, out of respect for the elections and for the European people."
"We should not do things any differently from what happens in the national parliaments in this respect."
"If the European Commissioners are the result of a majority in each country, our main concern should be that the Commission President is faithful to what the European people have voted for in the European elections, hence the importance and correctness of Mr Barroso becoming Commission President."
"This is a strictly democratic principle."
"There are two points which Mr Barroso made and which I do not have any doubts in clearly and definitively supporting."
"The first is the extent of the diagnosis of the current situation, which he gave in his speech and comments."
"We are not only experiencing an economic and financial crisis, but also a crisis of values."
"This is the first time that I have heard in this House any confirmation of these characteristics."
"We are not only experiencing a crisis, but also a changing world."
"That is why, more than ever before, the emphasis must be placed on positive action by individuals and on a change of attitude towards the State and the markets, because we have probably lived beyond our means in many EU countries."
"The second point, which I also support, is Mr Barroso's European ambition."
"Europe needs to elect, prioritise and organise, and the crisis and the Treaty of Lisbon are the two main issues on which the Commission President must particularly concentrate."
"Tackling the crisis requires a determined Commission and also a Parliament which is capable of tackling the serious circumstances that we are experiencing."
"The crisis is not yet over and its landscape is still unrecognisable."
"It is also forcing us to deal with social inequalities in the European Union."
"We therefore need the political ambition that you have shown this afternoon, Mr Barroso."
"(ES) Madam President, Mr President-designate, having listened to you closely, I should like to underline a few points on which many of us would agree with you."
"Firstly, it is clear that we are facing a crisis, yet many of us believe that, in recent years, Europe has been incapable of developing expectations and hopes that can overcome pessimism."
"Secondly, it is clear that we need the European Union, strong institutions and a Commission that knows where it is going."
"However, many of us think that you cannot be a candidate for re-election to the same Commission, but rather to a new Commission in order to start a new era in which we are confronted with many more and much tougher challenges."
"We need a Europe capable of regulating markets and guaranteeing rights, particularly social rights."
"However, we really need a Europe capable of adding value in order to correct global abuses and injustices at source."
"I have listened to the proposal to include a security-related immigration commissioner in your Commission."
"I would stress that immigration does not impact solely or mainly on our security, but on our values and our capacity to correct inequalities at source."
"As a result, tomorrow's vote will not mark the end of a process, but rather the first step or starting point in a huge task that the new Commission must take on so that, in defiance of those who want the paralysis or retreat of the European Union, it can give a new impetus to a much better Europe than the one we have known in recent years."
"This new Commission must be capable of asserting itself against the Europhobes and Eurosceptics; it must be capable of defending its independence as a European engine against the Council; and it must be capable, not only of cooperating, but also of continually responding to this Parliament."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Barroso, there are several elements to, and reasons for, our show of confidence and our very clear vote tomorrow."
"The first element is that of democratic consistency: with regard to the choice of the 27 Heads of State or Government who chose you unanimously; with regard to what we said during the electoral campaign - it was not so long ago - and with regard to the citizens' vote."
"We are not going to apologise for having won the elections, even though we are aware - we are well aware, I would say to our fellow Members - that we will have to surround you with more ideas than those of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) alone."
"Then, there is democratic consistency with regard to the exercise that you have been conducting for several weeks, in the demanding, sincere and humble dialogue with Parliament, and we are here to bear witness to it."
"There is a second reason, which is a conviction: the very strong conviction that there will be no strong policies in Europe if the institutions are weak."
"We need strong institutions."
"This is why we hope that the Treaty of Lisbon will be ratified."
"It is a tool box that will make the institutions work."
"We need a strong Commission that can confront the crisis as quickly as possible."
"The third reason is a contract of confidence that we have signed with you."
"In the face of this, the most serious and most profound economic, financial, food - let us not forget the one billion starving people in the world - and environmental crisis, we need the Commission to show its fighting spirit."
"We need you, and us with you, to learn all the lessons from this crisis, in terms of governance, regulation, innovation and new policies - I am thinking of the idea of a European savings bank to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the strategic sectors - and, with regard to the most profound crisis, the environmental crisis, to introduce a new model of economic and social growth, of green growth, as you yourself said."
"That, Mr Barroso, is why we shall be ready, tomorrow, to sign the contract of confidence with you."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech today, Mr Barroso, has not changed our opinion."
"Our view remains strongly negative."
"Throughout the years of your presidency, the Commission has shown itself to be incapable and lacking in autonomy."
"This was the case for the financial crisis and the same holds true for immigration policy: the safeguarding of fundamental rights and compliance with Community law must represent two sides of the same policy."
"You said in this Chamber that you intend to appoint a commissioner for justice and rights and a commissioner for internal affairs and immigration."
"Do not do that, Mr Barroso: immigration and rights must stay together so as not to endorse xenophobic policies."
"You have a majority here in Parliament, a right-wing majority, and clearly we are unable to identify with this majority."
"I understand the difficulties of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and the Democrats for Europe but, Mr Verhofstadt, do not tell us that the coherent approach that you called for in order to emerge from the crisis consists of the speed with which the Barroso Commission will be formed."
"It is obvious that we cannot identify with this majority."
"Our positions cannot be reconciled with those who do not resolutely fight for full and steadfast freedom of information, with those who do not fight to safeguard rights, and with those who view Parliament as a mere forum to represent national governments."
"(RO) Madam President, President of the Commission, the growth of energy security is an important item in your programme."
"The success of the negotiations with Turkey, which led to the signing of the Nabucco agreement, highlights that the European Union is able to represent Member States on the international stage, and I wish to congratulate you on this achievement."
"I hope that by using the same methods, a similar success will be achieved in securing the required volume of gas at a time when there are countries in the region which want to make their sources available for this project."
"The future Commission must create an internal energy market, effective competition and a high level of supply security for all Member States."
"In this respect, an important role will be played by the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators."
"Romania has applied to host the headquarters of this agency and I hope that it will enjoy the necessary support."
"Energy security also depends on the EU's neighbours."
"We must support neighbouring countries which subscribe to European values and aspire to become part of the European family."
"I also want to draw your attention to the still fragile political situation and the difficult economic situation in the Republic of Moldova."
"Support needs to be given urgently to the new political authorities in Chişinău to help them get through this difficult situation."
"Finally, I firmly believe that tomorrow's vote will demonstrate the stability of Europe's institutions and will make a positive contribution to the outcome of the referendum in Ireland."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Barroso, I might as well say it straight away: you did not convince the French socialists for five years, and you are not succeeding in convincing us now with a project in which you are as generous in word as you are general in purpose."
"How can you say to us 'vote for me if you want a Europe that is united in its diversity', when it is precisely because we want this Europe that we are recommending waiting for the Irish vote so as to vote on your candidacy?"
"Armed with the support of the Member States, you preferred to secure your appointment ahead of time and with fewer risks as regards the number of votes required."
"You thought that the passage before Parliament would be a mere formality: it is not so, and this is just the beginning, for your response does not meet the expectations of the citizens, who are suffering in the crisis and who have demonstrated their anger towards our institutions through their low turnout."
"You say that the crisis has changed you and you pose as the great navigator of a united Europe, but you have not been able to guide the Member States towards a truly European recovery plan, and we are still awaiting the concrete and binding measures needed for financial regulation."
"You claim to have given us guarantees regarding the social agenda, but all you are advocating is a new regulation, not a review of the Posting of Workers Directive."
"Moreover, you have not made a firm, and above all clear, commitment on a directive protecting public services."
"You show contempt for the MEPs' memory of events."
"We have not forgotten that, over the last five years, social issues have never been at the heart of the proposed solutions, and it is only now that you are agreeing to a social impact study for each piece of European legislation."
"In a period of unprecedented crisis, which is destroying hundreds of thousands of jobs, everything must be done to ensure that the number of European unemployed workers or working poor does not reach 25 million by 2010."
"For this we need an industrial policy to be adopted."
"The citizens need to be set an example of solidarity in order to combat the crisis."
"Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today."
"To carry on as before is disastrous, said the philosopher, Walter Benjamin."
"You still have a very long way to go to win over the socialists and the social democrats."
"For the sake of political consistency and out of respect for our electorate, we shall not vote for you."
"(NL) Madam President."
"Mr Barroso, the members of the Dutch delegation in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will be voting for you with conviction tomorrow."
"This is not only because we are convinced of your qualities but also because we are in a hurry."
"In our view, the last two months have been a lost opportunity to tackle the economic crisis - and we, the Dutch, are in a hurry."
"We do indeed want to see more social market economy in your programme - as far as we were concerned, the previous Commission was rather too liberal in that regard."
"We hope that you will continue the fight against excessive regulation and make Copenhagen a success, but reduce the number of European Agencies created."
"Another matter concerns Europe's citizens."
"Today, this afternoon, the word has come up perhaps two or three times."
"That is not enough."
"The European elections have shown us that we really have our work cut out to win the minds of ordinary people for Europe."
"The Opel workers who are to be made redundant must immediately think of Europe as a source of hope, a source of work."
"Finally, over the last six weeks, you have struck me as a man with passion and enthusiasm."
"You thrive when challenged."
"I urge you to keep that up for the next five years: I should like to see it every week."
"Madam President, we are indeed living in extraordinary times, but Mr Barroso's response to the economic crisis lacks strength and impact and his promises on social Europe have not been kept."
"Mr Barroso, your political guidelines provide little illumination as to your plans and drag out much of the same rhetoric used five years ago."
"Of course we need a strong and vibrant internal market bringing jobs and prosperity, but this must go hand in hand with improved social rights in Europe for workers and citizens, not at their expense."
"Despite strong pressure from this House to correct this imbalance and calls for a review of the Posted Workers Directive, for social impact assessments and for a more ambitious economic recovery package, we are still waiting."
"Earlier, you referred to union membership and the right to strike as sacred."
"Across the UK, unions are once more in talks over strike action in response to problems associated with the Posted Workers Directive, with fears of the undercutting of wages and undermining of collective agreements."
"Your answer to my question on this issue last week sounded like warm words, yet you admitted that the Directive falls short of its aims."
"The problems lie in implementation and interpretation by the European Court of Justice (ECJ)."
"You promised to make amends through a new legal instrument, but the ECJ judgments have shown we need to strengthen the directive to stop the undercutting of wages."
"At this time of financial crisis, we need clear legal guidelines and, Mr Barroso, we need the same wage for the same work at the same place, regardless of gender."
"What guarantees can you give us that this will be the case?"
"(NL) Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, these are difficult times, transitional times, times of change - but interesting times too."
"Institutionally speaking, we are on the way from Nice to Lisbon."
"I hope we arrive unscathed: financially, economically, ecologically, demographically, even in terms of energy, migration and security, and not forgetting globalisation, the food problem, the fight to preserve our social model - in all these fields we are in the throes of transition."
"Whether these are dangers or opportunities depends to a great extent on ourselves."
"One thing is certain in this regard: only if we take a European approach to the challenges, only if we tackle them with a solid, well-oriented European programme - which you have, Mr President-designate of the Commission - and if we have strong institutions to work with, can we help shape the future ourselves and further develop our socially and ecologically adjusted market economy."
"We have no time to lose - 'we are in a hurry', as my neighbour has just put it - and for this reason, too, we must press on with the matter of a new Commission."
"At present, ladies and gentlemen, we have one President-designate, and one only."
"We must give José Manuel Barroso our trust."
"I would ask anyone who disagrees to make sure they can tell friends from enemies - after all, what are you achieving with delays and dissenting votes?"
"If you do not want Mr Barroso, who do you want?"
"Who was your candidate, who is your candidate, I ask the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"If you succeed in your plans, are you sure you will obtain what you consider a better candidate, a better President of the Commission?"
"Mr President-designate of the Commission, you have my trust, and you will have my vote and that of my group colleagues."
"I wish you every success, including with the formation of the new Commission: you must be given elbow room to press on with this."
"(PT) President Barroso, the Lisbon Treaty will be ratified and will enter into force within a few months."
"That is my hope."
"It is clear from your programme and your speech today, however, that you want to strengthen the European Parliament's powers right away."
"I agree, because we can no longer go back to the time when the future of Europe was cooked up between the Council and the Commission, while the European Parliament was given the role of a mere onlooker."
"I believe, Mr Barroso, that your next mandate will be decisive for consolidating this new institutional balance between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"Our support is not, therefore, a blank cheque, but an investment."
"Our democratic tradition, the protection of human rights, and innovations in the production of cleaner forms of energy and better environmental policies are distinctive European features, but nothing makes us stand out from the rest of the world as much as our social policies."
"I must therefore express our hope that the Commission over which you will preside, I am sure, will assume the responsibility of protecting, consolidating and improving the European social model and promoting gender equality."
"Before I finish, I would like to emphasise that I have made a note of what you said today, your commitments for the future."
"You can count on the vote of the Portuguese Socialists."
"However, you can also count on a relationship that will certainly be loyal, but very demanding as well during your next term of office."
"I wish you good luck and success in your work."
"(DE) Madam President, Commission President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, what is tomorrow's vote all about?"
"It is about doing what many people in this House cannot do and others do not want to do."
"It is, in fact, about taking responsibility for Europe."
"I would like to highlight one point."
"Mr Barroso, I am very grateful to you for mentioning this again in your interruption."
"It is about taking responsibility for Europe's ability to act during a difficult time, in order to overcome all the problems which have been the subject of justified criticism from citizens and also from this Parliament."
"I believe that today's debate has helped to clarify the issue of whom Europe can and cannot rely on in future when it comes to taking political responsibility in the years to come."
"However, I would like to point out, Mr Barroso, that there is, of course, a whole series of subjects on the agenda which need to be dealt with and you have a great deal of responsibility in this area because you have a monopoly on launching initiatives at a European level."
"I would like to look at one more subject which seems to me not to have been covered in sufficient detail in the debate so far and that is agricultural policy."
"In this area, we are faced with several new challenges."
"It is not enough simply to mention the fact that the agriculture ministers came to a resolution in the autumn of last year."
"It is not enough that we have begun a programme of comprehensive agricultural reform, because when the basic conditions change, you must, of course, take a corresponding initiative to help farmers in the European Union."
"My request is that you take the Commissioner for Agriculture on one side and point out to her that her model will not succeed in guiding this important sector out of the crisis."
"We are prepared, and I am speaking on behalf of my colleagues here, to take over responsibility for Europe in the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Barroso, in February 2008, six months before the global financial crisis, the Hungarian Prime Minister proposed the establishment of a European institution to supervise and monitor global financial trends."
"Unfortunately, the Council and your Commission decided to set up this institution only after the global crisis had erupted."
"Mr Barroso, at what stage are the preparations for this institution?"
"When will the institution begin its work?"
"My second question is: over the last few years, the Commission has had no success in combating the predominance of the major commercial chains and has protected neither farmers nor consumers."
"Can we expect concrete and effective measures from the Commission?"
"My third question is: there is a profound crisis in the dairy sector throughout Europe, with very serious social and political consequences."
"Do you intend to amend, to revise the neoliberal policy pursued by the Commission thus far, which has failed completely?"
"My fourth question is: as a candidate for President, do you intend to establish a mediation mechanism?"
"Do you wish to reaffirm your intention to entrust the new commissioner in charge of fundamental rights with the responsibility for historical national minorities, immigrant minorities and the Roma?"
"(MT) Madam President, Mr Barroso, financial and economic challenges have been extensively discussed."
"Today, however, I would like to focus on citizens' rights and on the citizen's Europe."
"We talk of European citizenship, of citizens' rights, freedom of movement, the fight against criminality, the strengthening of security, the fight against terrorism and a common immigration policy."
"All of the above affect the European citizen, as do economic and financial issues."
"However, there are also other challenges which affect our citizens in their daily lives and which therefore deserve to be addressed."
"We do have a plan, a plan of creating a European space based on justice, freedom and security."
"We had the Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme, and now that of Stockholm."
"I believe that we must invest renewed energy in this field."
"The Stockholm Programme will open up new opportunities."
"Moreover, there is the Lisbon Treaty that will bestow new and important powers as well as grant a much greater role to this Parliament in this area."
"This evening you told us, President Barroso, that there will no longer be one but two Commissioners devoted to this field."
"We were told that there is to be a Commissioner responsible for internal affairs and immigration and another who will be assigned the area of justice, human rights and civil liberties."
"Let us form a partnership; a close partnership between the Commission and Parliament for a Europe that will indeed be a Europe for our citizens, a Europe that defends our citizens' rights; that protects our citizens' freedoms, that guards our citizens' security."
"Yes, I believe that together, we can work towards building a Europe for our citizens, and I wish you the best of luck in tomorrow's elections."
"(SL) I would agree with the comments of many of my colleagues who have already spoken, but allow me to also put the following questions to you, Mr Barroso: Have you taken stock of your previous term of office?"
"Are you satisfied with your achievements over the past five years?"
"I would imagine that you are and that that is the reason why you are standing for the presidency of the Commission again."
"However, I also wonder whether you are satisfied with how effective you have been to date as regards preventing financial, economic and social crises?"
"Can you witness, with a clear conscience, the staggering increase in unemployment figures which have now reached millions in the European Union, and the shameless rewards again being paid out by the financial sector to those who have not only plunged us into the worst crisis imaginable, but also threatened us with poverty?"
"Can you tell us today whether you are going to do things differently in your second term?"
"Are we going to see more of the same, or something new?"
"Is there anything we ought to be looking forward to?"
"What do you think you need to change about the way in which you go about your work?"
"Allow me to put one more question to you: it is one that you have been going to great lengths to avoid addressing in your policy guidelines."
"You clearly want to lead the Commission of a European Union that numbers 500 million people."
"Where is the ambition and drive of our great community when it comes to opening the door to those fellow Europeans who want to join it?"
"What additional efforts will your Commission make in order to speed up this process?"
"Will you offer tangible assistance, i.e. expertise and material resources, to the central government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to help it achieve its roadmap and the criteria needed for its citizens to travel freely within the European Union?"
"Madam President, Mr Barroso will have our support tomorrow, not only because you are nominated by all 27 Member States, Mr Barroso, and not only because we need to start work, but also because you have presented a broad political agenda that addresses the main challenges of our time."
"Of course, we all have different views on that."
"We will call on initiatives from you and your Commission based upon the majority of this Parliament, not by trying to impose minority positions, and we will discuss and scrutinise your proposals and take decisions based upon the majority of this Parliament."
"That is how democracy works, and that is how we work."
"We are confident not only in you, but also in this Parliament."
"Just let me say that voting 'no' tomorrow without an alternative means that you do not have an alternative."
"At the same time as we are calling for action, there are those who want to stop the action."
"And I must say that with only weeks to go until the Copenhagen meeting, it is not responsible to act in such a way that we shall not have a leadership in place for the Commission."
"At a time when we need to deal with all the arrangements and legislation on financial markets, the alternative of saying 'no' to a new Commission is not responsible."
"And to act in a way that we cannot start the political process for economic recovery when jobs are threatened all over Europe is not responsible."
"Madam President, this vote tomorrow is very much a vote about the standing of the European Parliament."
"We, as parliamentarians, are saying that we want Europe to have leadership in the world, but we can never have global leadership if we cannot ensure leadership of the European Union."
"We will give you our support, and we will scrutinise the proposals, and we will discuss with you, because we have confidence in democracy and the majority we have in this Parliament."
"Good luck tomorrow."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, following this debate I am even more convinced that I am right to back the proposal put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to support your candidacy, and as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to offer you my modest contribution: Mr Barroso, I endorse your objectives and the priorities you set out, but allow me to suggest two areas of greater focus, in particular with regard to what you refer to as moving out of this economic and financial crisis."
"I believe, as you do, that this crisis is also, and above all, a crisis of our values, of the basic values of our society."
"Over the next five years, the European Commission will have to address major challenges."
"The geopolitical framework has undergone radical change."
"The emerging countries, the emerging economies such as India, Brazil and Africa, now play a significant role in the real economy."
"On the one hand, this affords us new opportunities for growth, while on the other, it exposes us to the risk of market hegemonies which, in the long term, could produce higher levels of poverty."
"In this regard, the role of Europe, its civilisation and its wisdom is essential to foster widespread, balanced growth and encourage the attainment of civil rights."
"It represents the genuine integration of different roots and cultures."
"I am referring to our roots, our Christian roots, which could be the tool with which we can tackle the value aspect of this extremely serious crisis, but only if we use them as a guide in the promotion of development and the integration of everyone's rights and duties."
"On the financial level, Mr Barroso, we must assess the need for reform of monetary and fiscal policy in order to defuse the struggle between our currency, the euro, and the old hegemony of the dollar, and also the struggle with the emerging currencies of China and India; to obtain stricter regulation of the financial market together with bans on speculation in energy commodities and, above all, food commodities, whose prices can starve many economies; to bring finance back to its main role of serving production; and to replace or support the traditional economic contributions in depressed European regions with tax incentives."
"With regard to the citizens' Europe which you propose to develop by intensifying dialogue and distributing information, I feel personally involved as Chairman of the Committee on Petitions."
"Therefore, this committee should be called upon if Parliament follows up on the resolution adopted during the previous parliamentary term."
"The Committee on Petitions is the first point of contact between the European institutions and citizens."
"It seeks solutions, provides explanations and promotes actions in response to the numerous and varied complaints made by European citizens."
"In this connection, Mr Barroso, I urge you to strengthen relations between the Commission which you have the honour to lead and the committee which I chair, the Committee on Petitions, and establish a specific commissioner for it."
"You have already announced the creation of two new commissioner posts."
"A Europe which focuses its work programme on its citizens, as you stated, is a Europe which must provide this committee - which is the forum, the place where citizens' rights have a voice - with greater rights and greater dignity."
"(FR) Madam President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have examined the guidelines of your programme and I welcome your ambition in each of the major policy areas, including economic policy, with the continuation and creation of activities; the recovery plan; social cohesion; environmental policy, and especially sustainable development; the projects aimed at our young people; the strengthening of European defence; and the continuation of a strong and sustained agricultural policy."
"I applaud your ambition to have a conquering, united and protective Europe, as we want."
"However, I question the European Union's financial standing as regards all of your projects."
"The Union must have the financial resources for its ambitions."
"Some of my fellow Members have already stressed this point."
"It is vital, in my view, Mr Barroso, that we see you undertake to encourage the Member States to increase their contributions to the Community budget substantially from 2014."
"It is true that the crisis is putting the Member States' budgets under pressure at the moment."
"All the same, we must look ahead to the post-crisis period and start work now on a Community budget that will meet the needs of European action."
"I know that you are conscious of this need, as you addressed it in your programme."
"All that remains today is for you to commit yourself to ensuring that, in future, we, Parliament and the Council will have the resources needed to apply our policies."
"(LV) I should like to confirm that the Members of the Group of the European People's Party from Latvia will support President J. M. Barroso's candidature."
"We shall support you because we hope that you, Mr Barroso, will continue as President of the European Commission to work for a fairer Europe."
"We consider that fairness should be achieved between all Member States as regards support for farmers, regardless of how long they have been members of the European Union."
"We also expect that you will take the leadership role in reform of the common agricultural policy and in securing the possibility of fair competition for all Member States."
"We call upon you to take the lead in the further liberalisation of the European services market."
"Europe will only emerge successfully from the crisis if it bases its strategy on a strong single market and a level playing field."
"European institutions do indeed have a stabilising role in overcoming the crisis in those Member States most severely affected, and Latvia knows this."
"I would like to thank the European Commission for working with us."
"The European single currency has proved its stabilising role in these crisis conditions."
"The Baltic States have set themselves the goal of accession to the euro area, but during the global downturn, this is a very stiff task."
"That is why we are calling on the Commission to promote a sensible, flexible approach to the application of the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria, appropriate to the crisis."
"I am convinced that the earlier inclusion of the Baltic States and of all European countries in the euro area is in the interests of Europe as a whole."
"Mr President, we urge you to move faster in developing a common energy policy to reduce Europe's dependence on monopolies."
"I wish you success in the vote tomorrow."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Barroso, as a member of the French delegation of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and as a representative of the Nouveau Centre, a French political party born out of the UDF, I was keen to address you directly today."
"Above all, I should like to remind you of the support of the President of the Republic and of the French Government and to applaud the way in which you were able to contribute to the success of the French Presidency."
"Mr Barnier and all of my parliamentary colleagues from the French presidential majority now expect that our mission to build a political Europe that can influence the major global issues of the future will be taken up and shared by your Commission."
"In order to build this political Europe, Mr Barroso, two pitfalls must be avoided in our view."
"Firstly, that of presenting competition as an absolute and insurmountable dogma."
"Yes, Europe needs industrial policy, agricultural policy, energy policy, or energy policy that promotes new technologies as much as it needs competition policy."
"The second pitfall to avoid is that of turning this Commission into a mere general secretariat of the Council."
"We need a Commission that is strong, that makes proposals, that innovates and that drives this European integration."
"Thus, despite the reservations that may have been expressed by my own political party in France, I am willing today to support your action and to accompany you on this purposeful path on which you seem to want to embark, not least in terms of sustainable development and of the fight against climate change."
"However, to ensure that my vote, and that of several of my parliamentary colleagues who still have some questions today, can be as informed as possible, I would like you to make two strong commitments in this House."
"Firstly, to implement a really purposeful policy in favour of our industries, of our territories and of everything that forges a European identity."
"Secondly, to do everything possible to ensure that the European model is the one that best reconciles the market economy with the requirement for solidarity among Member States, regions and populations."
"Mr Barroso, today's young people need a Europe that supports them in globalisation and that embodies a new hope, and, as the youngest of the French MEPs, I am thoroughly convinced that these young people want a Europe that both protects them and offers them a new ambition."
"In the future, it is our task to build Europe together."
"I am counting on you just as you can count on me."
"(PL) Madam President, Europe is united."
"It is a Europe of peace, freedom and democracy."
"We observe human rights and we want to realise a programme of social market economy - a programme which puts people at the centre of our attention."
"However, Europe is also diversified."
"We have many very poor regions, and there is, therefore, a need for a genuine Cohesion Policy."
"The common agricultural policy actually sanctions two Europes - the old and the new."
"This requires changes and the creation of a genuine, unified, united and cohesive Europe."
"You, Mr President, know this best of all."
"What action do you intend to take in this area, in order to change this situation?"
"(FI) Madam President, President Barroso, in my opinion you have succeeded magnificently in the role of President of the Commission."
"It is easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit is due."
"Leading 27 different countries in a pluralist Europe is a challenging task and you have done it well."
"You have been a balancing factor between the large and small countries, so in this connection I would like to borrow the words of my party's Chairman, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, who said that you deserved a further term of office."
"I am greatly in favour of your further term and I will vote for it."
"What you have accomplished in five years speaks for itself."
"In my view, there is no longer any need for proposals for new programmes because actions speak for themselves and I hope that the Finnish Commissioner, Olli Rehn, will also enjoy a good and strong position in the next Commission."
"Most important of all, however, is that tomorrow we will vote in favour of your being able to establish a new Commission."
"I wish you every success."
"Madam President, Mr Barroso has spoken quite often about the extraordinary times we live in, the important issues faced and the leadership the EU has to show in the financial market sector."
"However, Mr Barroso, there is one thing I should like to ask you about - and you mention it in the paper you presented to us - namely the European Union's own financial resources."
"You do not say where they should come from."
"In this connection, there is one question that I asked you about at the hearing we had with the Greens/EFA Group last week."
"Unfortunately I did not get an answer from you; hopefully I will now."
"My question is: what about a financial transaction tax?"
"Even Mr Sarkozy has now proposed this, and Mr Steinmeier and others are talking about it now."
"Belgium and France already have legal instruments to implement it, so why not talk and bring pressure to bear with a view to a Commission proposal on a financial transaction tax?"
"(EL) Madam President, I have listened twice to Mr Barroso, once in plenary and once at a conference with the European United Left, and I have read his planning positions."
"I have one specific comment: we know Mr Barroso's position on the modified policies."
"We have not seen his position on modified products."
"Does that mean the importation and marketing of contaminated products is to be tolerated in Europe?"
"Generally, while maintaining that he is promoting the new ideas which Europe needs, Mr Barroso is essentially promoting and proposing the same failed, neo-liberal recipes which led to depression in Europe, unemployment in Europe and serious social inequalities in Europe."
"This approach, by which I mean your approach, Mr Barroso, and your Commission's approach, has created a confidence gap between the leadership of the European Union and European citizens, which was clearly reflected in the last elections, with the massive numbers of European citizens who abstained."
"Finally, as you call everyone who does not agree with your programme anti-European, you will not have the ear of all Europeans, especially those who want a different Europe, which is why, in my opinion, Mr Barroso, you are not suited to this position."
"(NL) Mr Barroso, you have not managed to gain the support of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament or the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - which actually speaks in your favour."
"It will be an exciting election: if I have a look, you can count on approximately half of the votes, so every vote counts."
"Of course you would like our vote too, that of the second-largest Dutch party in Parliament, the Party for Freedom."
"We are prepared to give you our vote, but you need to promise to stop the negotiations with Turkey, to make sure that the Netherlands is no longer the largest net contributor to this bureaucratic EU, and to work towards a Europe of sovereign Member States rather than the federal superstate to which you aspire."
"I invite you to pay us a visit at 22.00 today to discuss this."
"Who knows, you may make these promises, obtain our support and be able to continue with your work - just in a completely different way from the last five years."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to wish Mr Barroso well for tomorrow in the vote."
"Unfortunately, I was of the opinion that the vote should have been held in July so as not to allow a lacuna of uncertainty to develop."
"However, in saying that, I think the political guidelines which you have produced, Mr Barroso, clearly outline the kind of vision and ideas that you have for getting things back on the road."
"Maybe my biggest appeal to you - not only about coming back to Parliament - would also be to be a bit more critical of governments when they fail to live up to their commitments because, even if we look at the Lisbon Strategy, 90% of the Lisbon Strategy has failed to be implemented because Member States have failed to take action to make us the most competitive and the most dynamic economy of the future."
"I know it is difficult to try and pinpoint any one individual state."
"I would not dare to do so, but if we are leading by example, and, if we are putting down ideas between Parliament and the Commission about the ways we can see of regenerating new growth and about being innovative within the new economy, then the Member States must also step up to the plate and take those actions."
"Finally, it saddens me, at a time when there are unprecedented economic difficulties throughout the globe, when we in Europe are seen to take the lead with regard to banking regulation and other areas like that, that we have lost the opportunity because of juvenile political games among certain groups."
"(ES) Mr Barroso, you are regarded as a champion of environmental protection, and I congratulate you for it."
"In fact, last week we had good news because it was finally decided that bluefin tuna, which is facing collapse, would be protected by including it in the list of species protected by CITES."
"In this respect, I call for this temporary support to become permanent support."
"The problem and global paradox in all this is that it is the neoliberal policies that you have advocated to date which have led us into this situation, because they are policies which simply privatise profit and socialise costs."
"In this respect, we are facing a serious problem with the environment."
"For years we have been subsidising fleets, which have depleted our seas and which, in this precise context, are, in many cases, jointly responsible for the disaster."
"They are now asking for money to overcome the situation which we have caused."
"This is absurd and truly difficult to justify democratically."
"We cannot make these mistakes with people's money."
"We therefore call for the common fisheries policy to be revised, specifically based on these new principles."
"Madam President, I am very confident that Mr Barroso will tomorrow secure another five-year mandate as the next president of the Commission."
"I believe he is the right person for the job and his track record has been impressive."
"I also believe that the EU will operate more effectively if the Lisbon Treaty is passed in my country."
"Those opposing the Treaty in Ireland are spreading scurrilous information about the minimum wage to be EUR 1.84."
"People speak of green shoots as part of the economic recovery in Europe."
"The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is a green shoot in itself."
"The investment community and people who create jobs want the Lisbon Treaty enacted."
"The fact that we in Ireland, since the last referendum, have secured the right to nominate one member of the European Commission into the future is a serious change."
"In addition to that, the legal guarantees relating to neutrality, tax, the right to life, education and the family are important."
"These guarantees are important to us."
"Protocols are the same as the Treaty and, of course, Ireland needs Europe; Europe needs Ireland."
"(GA) I wish you the very best of luck tomorrow."
"(DE) Madam President, the European Union is suffering from a dramatic democratic deficit."
"Unfortunately nothing has changed in this respect during the last five years under the leadership of Mr Barroso."
"During his period of office, we have fallen into a very severe economic crisis and it has become clear that all the warnings relating to the instability of the financial system were simply ignored."
"These warnings were definitely made."
"Mr Barroso talks in his speech about the need to change the architecture of the financial system and to reform the bonus system for managers."
"I would like to say clearly: Mr Barroso, that was your task during the last five years and you have not done it."
"For this reason, I will be voting you out of office."
"Personally, I would like to see a young Commission President who takes on the role with plenty of creativity, with the courage to make major changes and, above all, with independence: someone who turns Europe into a true democracy."
"I am certain that Europe needs a new mood of optimism and this certainly will not come about with Mr Barroso, but only without him."
"(HU) Thank you for this opportunity to speak."
"I would like to ask President Barroso two questions."
"The first one is as follows: In your speech, you clearly linked your political future with the Lisbon Treaty coming into force."
"Does this also mean that if you are elected tomorrow and the Lisbon Treaty fails to be accepted by the Irish referendum, you will then resign?"
"My second question is the following. You have declared war on national egoism which, according to your definition, stems from anxiety and turns into extremism."
"My question is: who will decide whether people, organisations or parties are still involved in this harmful activity?"
"Or is it about them, as in our case, having as their objective the promotion of national awareness, the necessary preservation of national self-determination?"
"In other words, does this provide us with a basis for talking here in Europe about national cultures, languages and diversity?"
"Madam President, I would like to begin with a procedural issue."
"I wish to say, in particular to the non-attached Members, that I did not go to see their group because they did not invite me."
"It is as simple as that."
"Of course, I have strong differences of opinion with some of these Members and with others too, but I went to see all of the groups who invited me, all of the legitimately formed groups."
"I went there for a democratic debate."
"I like democratic debate."
"Let us be clear on that."
"I shall try to respond quickly to a large number of questions."
"Moreover, I can see that, at times, Members are no longer here to listen to me, but I am going to make an effort all the same."
"I will begin with the issue of bonuses, which was the last question."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that, at the end of 2004, the Commission - my Commission - made a recommendation on excessive remuneration, not only in banks, but also in the economic system in general."
"Unfortunately, at that time, no one paid attention to our recommendation."
"I am glad that this issue of bonuses and excessive remuneration is now becoming more of a priority and I hope that we will be able to find a solution, on the basis, I might add, of the proposals that we have submitted to the Council."
"They are on the table: a recommendation, but also a binding part of the Directive on capital requirements for banks."
"Many questions focused on energy security: those of Mr Saryusz-Wolski, Mr Marinescu and others."
"Energy security was, in fact, one of the main priorities of this College, and I also intend to include it in the priorities of the next Commission, if I have your Parliament's consent, since it is to the Commission that Europeans look, and not just the Europeans of the Union."
"When there was the problem between Russia and Ukraine, President Putin decided to call me specifically to inform me of that problem, and you know just how much time and energy we at the Commission, together with other partners, have put into trying to find a solution to a problem that concerned Russia and Ukraine but which has had consequences for European consumers."
"I personally am very committed to these issues."
"That is why, I might add, we launched the interconnections programme in the Baltic states, and that is why it was the Commission that broke the deadlock on the Nabucco issue - and let us be clear, it was completely deadlocked."
"I shall therefore include these issues among the Commission's main priorities, but there is, in fact, resistance to the creation of a real internal energy market."
"I hope that during the next term, with your support, we are going to overcome this resistance that - let us be frank and sincere - does still exist, in order to establish a real integrated energy market in Europe."
"You can count on me at the Commission to be uncompromising in my defence of the European interest."
"What is more, I believe that this problem of energy security is also crucial to the issue of combating climate change."
"I will say it again, in particular for the benefit of the Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: one can always be more ambitious but, frankly, I believe that we should welcome the fact that the European Union, acting on the basis of a Commission proposal, is spearheading the fight against climate change."
"It is clear that, subsequently, we would not have had the agreement of all the Member States were it not for the work - and I want to make this point - of Mrs Merkel's presidency, and then of Mr Sarkozy's presidency, since they worked to achieve this too, and it is only right to acknowledge it."
"All the Member States made an effort, but it was on the basis of an ambitious proposal by the Commission that we were able to conduct this fight against global warming, and I am very much counting on your efforts so that we can keep Europe in the vanguard of this fight."
"With regard to the social issues, I have already said my piece: I have already given some very concrete undertakings on the issues relating to the posting of workers and on the problems concerning public services."
"I will be willing to work with you on these principles that I have mentioned and that I have spelt out very clearly today: against social dumping, for the social market economy."
"I am well aware that this is an interesting ideological debate, but I believe that we have the answer in Europe."
"We need an internal market - it is our strength - and, at the same time, a high level of social cohesion."
"This is a European creation; it is a contribution."
"In the quotation I included at the start of my document, I quoted a great European contemporary historian, Tony Judt, who lectures at New York University."
"He said: 'The United States may have the most powerful army in the world, China may sell cheaper goods, but only Europe has a model that can serve as an inspiration to the rest of the world'."
"The 21st century could well be Europe's century."
"I believe that."
"I believe that we can manage this globalisation not by force but with inspiration."
"We have a social market economy that is not the property of the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats or the Liberals."
"It was created by Europe, particularly after the Second World War: not only the European integration process, but also this social market economy aimed at combining free markets, open markets."
"Europe is the world's biggest export power."
"We Europeans must therefore reject protectionism and, at the same time, must promote the European social dialogue model, the European social security model."
"When I hear certain 'declinists' - the 'crisis-lovers' - say that it is now the Americans and the Chinese who are controlling everything, I say to them: be that as it may, but what is President Obama doing?"
"President Obama is currently attempting - I wish him well - to introduce a national health care system, which we have practically everywhere in Europe, with some differences."
"It is the Americans who are now taking inspiration from the European model."
"What are the Chinese doing?"
"They are now considering - with the additional aim of boosting demand - the introduction of a social security system, and I believe that they will have this system, because there will be a rise in prosperity in that country, and this rising prosperity in China is good for the entire world."
"What are the Americans and other major powers doing today?"
"They are starting to talk to us about combating climate change."
"I clearly recall that, when we spoke with them before, the Americans flatly refused to make any kind of target-related commitment in the fight against climate change."
"As you can see, I cannot be as pessimistic as some of those who have spoken here today."
"Of course, we have problems in Europe, consistency problems."
"In terms of political will, we must work harder to achieve more consistency."
"We also have a very clear problem, a social problem, which is the most serious of all: the rise in unemployment."
"Let us be clear, however: it is not Europe, it is not the European Commission that created this financial crisis."
"You all know where this crisis came from."
"Immediately after, we reacted."
"We reacted with concrete proposals."
"I was in the United States with the French President, when it was the French Presidency, to propose the launch of this G20 process to the US President."
"It was Europe that instigated this response."
"I said at Camp David that just as open societies need the rule of law, legal rules, in the same way, the markets also need rules in order to be legitimate, credible and ethical."
"That is the European position."
"I believe in fact that we should be proud of the proposals we have made."
"They are on the table."
"I hope that they will be adopted, and we will see as we go along whether an additional effort is needed."
"On the subject of the environment, I believe that this Commission's track record is well known. Someone said that biodiversity is not in there."
"Re-read my document and you will see that it is in there. Furthermore, one Member of this House applauded our measures to protect bluefin tuna, and I thank them for that."
"I believe that we have some good credentials there."
"With regard to Mrs Beňová's question about fundamental rights, it is precisely in order to give this new sign of commitment that I decided to create - and I would add that the proposal came from the European Parliament, even though I was already convinced on the matter - the post of commissioner responsible for fundamental rights and individual freedoms."
"The commissioner will also deal with the issue of minorities, of course, and he or she will be able to report to the Committee on Petitions, which was mentioned here."
"I also believe that, as in the national systems, where there is normally a minister for justice and a minister for the interior, we should have a commissioner in charge of justice, fundamental rights and freedoms."
"There will be another commissioner - because we must also be serious about this, we must also see that there are problems to do with insecurity in Europe and that there are things that we can do together with the added value of Europe - who will also look at other issues, but always with the same spirit: the spirit of security, with full respect shown for individual freedoms and with full respect shown for fundamental rights."
"That, once again, is what makes Europe."
"Someone spoke of Guantánamo."
"I was one of the first, if not the first, politician in office within a government to call on the US President - this was during the Austrian Presidency - to close Guantánamo."
"I said this publicly because I believe that we Europeans are against an anti-terrorism campaign that does not respect fundamental rights, as that is how moral authority is lost."
"On the subject of fundamental rights, I believe that we may have certain disagreements, but that there are no fundamental disagreements with some of the Members who raised this issue."
"I myself do not need advice from anyone on this issue."
"At the age of sixteen, I had already taken to the streets of my country to fight against a dictatorship, against the colonial system."
"Therefore I do not need anyone's advice on how to show commitment to fundamental rights."
"Thank you, anyway."
"With regard to the question on Northern Ireland - thank you, Mrs Dodds: it is true that we have made a great - discreet - effort for Northern Ireland."
"We set up a special working group and, back when a dialogue had not yet been established between the parties, we helped to bring about this reconciliation."
"With regard to the question put by Mr López Aguilar, yes, I believe that now is the time for a new social ambition."
"That is obvious."
"We have an unemployment problem that is much greater than before."
"If you look at the statistics, the truth is that, until the financial crisis, employment was rising everywhere."
"The Lisbon Strategy, which some criticise, was actually heading in the right direction, overall."
"There was job creation and growth in Europe."
"It is just with the financial crisis that we have seen the reverse of the trend in most countries, including your own, Spain."
"It is the global financial crisis that has put us in a different position."
"So, now, in this state of social anxiety - not only are there people who are unemployed but there are others who are liable to become so - it is obvious that we must make a social investment."
"That is why I have called for a new social ambition."
"I believed that it would be possible to unite the large majority of Parliament around this priority, and I still believe it."
"Mrs in 't Veld told me that I had not convinced her."
"You are very difficult to convince, Mrs in 't Veld."
"I will do my best, but I will tell you one thing: I will always do my best, not just to convince you, but because I genuinely believe in fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"I believe that the Commission has a role in this matter, not only in terms of legislation, but also regarding the signals we send out."
"I can tell you that, whenever there is a problem in the world, be it Guantánamo or when I meet with Mr Putin, each time I ask him: 'What is happening with Mrs Politkovskaya's killers?"
"I put the question to President Putin, just as I am currently putting questions to the prime ministers, including even the Chinese Prime Minister, when I speak to him, and just as I am always asking questions about human rights."
"I am even asking the Japanese Prime Minister why Japan is now carrying out capital punishment again, when there was a moratorium."
"Therefore, the Commission is important, not only through legislation, but also through the signals sent out by the Commission and the Commission President, such as the time of the crisis concerning the cartoons in Denmark, where I unequivocally defended and upheld the right to freedom of expression."
"I believe, in fact, that we can find a fundamental line of agreement on this."
"Mr Abad asked some very practical questions, and I would say to him that I support his suggestions and I believe that they are important."
"I believe that we need an industrial base in Europe."
"We do not want relocation, but it is important for this industrial base to adapt to the new constraints of global competition and, above all, to the major challenges of climate change and of more sustainable growth."
"I believe that we have the means to achieve this."
"That is why I am proposing that, in future, more resources be put into this at European level."
"With regard to the budget-related question that someone asked, let us try, above all, to reach a consensus on the main principles."
"I believe that it would be a mistake to start by talking about the amounts for the future budget."
"That would cause divisions."
"We must first see where there is European added value and, afterwards, decide what the priorities will be."
"However, I believe that research, innovation and cohesion policy clearly must be important priorities, especially when the new generations are considered."
"For the benefit of the youngest member of the French delegation, I hope that the young people of this Parliament will support this movement."
"Someone asked me a question about the global financial tax, about the tax on financial movements."
"If it is global, I support it, obviously."
"I think that it would be an excellent idea but, in any case, let us be clear: I see no point in driving out the financial services that we have now in Europe, whether they be in London, Frankfurt or Paris."
"We are world leaders when it comes to financial services."
"What is the point of handing over the leadership to Dubai?"
"I do not see what the point would be."
"Let us be clear on that."
"However, if there were a global tax on financial transactions, I think that would be an excellent idea."
"I believe that there are already quite a number of reasons in favour of that: to prevent, for example, starvation in the world, for it is scandalous what is happening in the 21st century; to help Europe achieve the Millennium Goals; and to fight for more solidarity in Europe."
"You may not know, but I proposed to the Council that we increase a facility that we have within Europe to provide food aid, because there are poor and newly poor people in Europe, but it was rejected."
"Those are many reasons, if you will, for a tax, provided that it is genuinely global and that it does not undermine Europe's competitiveness."
"To conclude, I would like to say something very important to you."
"Some have said: 'Why should we elect you?"
"You are the only candidate."
"Is that democratic?'"
"I myself have very often wondered why I am the only candidate."
"Frankly, I believe that it was wrong for me to be the only candidate, because, let us be clear, as I am the only candidate, I have been the only one attacked for all this time, the only one criticised."
"Every time you compare me with your ideal candidate, I lose, obviously."
"I lose to an ideal candidate."
"I lose to an ideal candidate from each group."
"Yet Europe is not built with ideal candidates."
"Europe is an exercise in responsibility."
"I believe that there has been no other candidate for the simple reason that the support needed to be a candidate was lacking."
"That is the reason."
"A fair few names were mentioned, but I succeeded in achieving a consensus and I am proud of that, because building Europe today, as we have seen in the debate, is - as all of you will admit - an extremely difficult and extremely hard exercise."
"Europe is very diverse."
"There are many constraints and many priorities, and so I am proud to be the candidate that has been supported by the party that won the elections, to be the candidate that has received the support of democratically elected Heads of State or Government, from across the political spectrum, and I do not see that as negative."
"That said, I am no one's secretary-general, and the Commission is an independent institution."
"I can assure you of that."
"The Commission over which I preside and over which I will preside if I have your backing will be independent in its uncompromising defence of the European general interest."
"I fully understand, as Mrs Estrela and others have said, that the support of those who will be willing to back me is not a blank cheque."
"I am grateful to all those who have supported me;"
"I cannot name them all."
"Some of them are still here."
"I am grateful to you."
"Your support is not a blank cheque."
"I think highly of Parliament."
"Some say: 'You are too close to the governments'."
"You forget one thing: before becoming Prime Minister, I was leader of the opposition, and before becoming leader of the opposition, I sat on the benches."
"I was elected for the first time to the Portuguese parliament when I was 29 years old."
"I am a politician;"
"I am not a technocrat or a bureaucrat."
"I defend parliaments and I want to engage with you in this debate."
"Therefore, your demands can help me and can help the Commission to do better."
"This is what I shall aim to do if I have your support."
"(Applause)"
"I would like to thank the President-designate of the European Commission."
"I would also like to thank all those present, as well as those who spoke earlier, for an exceptionally animated discussion."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Malmström for being with us in this session."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are bringing in new principles of action, new institutional solutions for the European Union."
"Please remember that the President-designate has told us about the directions of political action for the next five years."
"He has done this here, in Parliament, where he has met with all the political groups."
"He has given us information which is very important, both for us and for our citizens."
"We will vote tomorrow, after today's long, exhaustive and wise discussion."
"(The President continued in English)"
"Thank you very much once again, Mr President-designate."
"This was a great opportunity to have your political guidelines and discussion in political groups and also in the plenary session."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr Barroso's programme is ambitious and demonstrates an overwhelming desire to give our crisis-hit Europe the boost it sorely needs."
"In my opinion, it would be wrong to blame Mr Barroso personally for all the troubles that have characterised the previous period."
"Compromising with an enlarged Commission in which decisions are now taken by the 27, and tackling a financial and economic crisis against a backdrop of difficult institutional reform, has certainly not made President Barroso's job any easier."
"Admittedly, one might have hoped, in these difficult times, to have heard him speak with a more assertive European voice."
"I believe, however, that he has learnt from his mistakes and that, in future, he will make great efforts both for Europe as a whole and for the small countries."
"By making social issues a more important part of his programme, he appears to want to respond to the people of Europe, who are yearning for a more social Europe."
"The idea of a genuine partnership between Parliament and the Commission is a commendable one and is an opportunity to be seized."
"For this reason I support Mr Barroso's candidacy, but this support is not a blank cheque."
"I am pleased to say that, as a Portuguese and a Member of the European Parliament, I will vote in favour of the re-election of José Manuel Durão Barroso as President of the European Commission."
"I believe his performance during the current mandate, which has been beset by so many political, financial and social difficulties, and the experience he has acquired in this post, justify the support of the governments and the renewed confidence of this House."
"I deplore the many attempts - not all of them open or serious - to prevent his candidacy from succeeding, and I note that they were frustrated not only by a lack of any credible alternative but also by the foolishness of their arguments."
"I regret that Members from my own country cannot resist taking that path, which is as easy as it is inconsequential."
"I hope the second Barroso Commission can combine technical competence with that 'something extra'."
"I also hope it will effectively respect and make use of the principle of subsidiarity, and will choose the safety and solidity of taking small steps, as recommended by Jean Monnet, rather than adopting the fast-track approach that has promised much but contributed little to the real progress of the European project and dream."
"However much we aim for the horizon, we only get there by putting one foot in front of the other."
"Let us go the right way."
"What is also at stake in this election is the direction the EU will take in the next few years."
"The current President of the Commission, who is standing for another term of office, symbolises one possible direction: the EU he represents is that of the interests of the major economic groups."
"That is the EU of undemocratic red tape; of political and ideological conservatism; of the accentuation and institutionalisation of profound inequalities and relations of social, regional and national domination; of militarism and external interventionism; and of the institutionalisation of neoliberalism as the only acceptable economic system."
"That, however, is not and never has been the only possible direction."
"The alternative to that direction is that of a social Europe, the Europe of workers and peoples."
"It is an EU that values democracy in its participatory aspects, not reducing it to the formal representational sphere."
"It is an EU which respects the will of its peoples and the decisions that they democratically express, and which protects public services and workers' rights as essential tools for social development and cohesion."
"It is an EU of free, sovereign states with equal rights, which supports and promotes the protection of nature, peace and cooperation among peoples."
"The statement that Mr Barroso has just made as President-designate of the Commission is a reaffirmation of the basic pillars of the European Union that we know."
"It also confirms the capitalist, federalist and militarist integration of Europe enshrined in the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice, which the draft Treaty of Lisbon wishes to take even further."
"If there were any doubt, his statements are there on the importance of the draft Treaty of Lisbon."
"They come, in fact, after the anti-democratic pressure exerted by European leaders - which he observed - on the Irish people, who are being forced to have a new referendum, to be held on 2 October."
"Even if he now tries to promise to remedy the serious attacks on social and workers' rights that the European Commission, of which he is still the President, carried out in the previous term of office, he has never got to the bottom of those issues or the causes of the current crisis of capitalism that we are experiencing."
"In practice, what he is proposing is to carry on with the same policy that prioritises free competition, militarism and the interests of economic and financial groups, particularly those of the most powerful countries, as was clear when he said we are the champions of globalisation."
"Mr President, I would like to guarantee President Barroso my support as the European People's Party's delegate, and express the hope that the present Europe Commission will be able to continue the job which has been started involving the social integration of the Roma."
"Important results have been achieved during this cycle, mainly during the last two years, but we are expecting a significantly deeper commitment and a greater sense of initiative in the future from this body which, as the exclusive initiator of Community legislation, can be the driving force in the battle against the poverty and exclusion affecting Europe's largest minority, the Roma."
"I hope that the creation of a new commissioner's portfolio for justice, fundamental rights and civil liberties will encourage the Commission's organisation to do more and in a more coordinated manner."
"I also hope that President Barroso will continue to actively promote his personal commitment to Roma affairs, which he has also expressed on several occasions, and that he will do his utmost to ensure that Heads of State or Government will assume a more vigorous role in devising a comprehensive, integrated programme spanning parties and cycles."
"The social challenges affecting Roma and non-Roma alike are so serious and the consequences of inaction are so dangerous that we cannot afford to have the apathy and slip-ups of the previous cycle."
"We are expecting immediate, brave deeds and a radical change to the attitude held up until now from the past-present President, and for the Commission's to be the flagship of a pan-European Roma Strategy to be developed as soon as possible, based on regulatory norms, a stable budget and clear political commitment."
"If there is one thing that nobody questions across all parties, it is that we are going through a period of economic crisis, which affects countries and makes government decision making difficult."
"Since that is the case, having a validated Commission whose president has been elected or a provisional Commission in which this decisive decision is always being postponed makes a difference to how effectively the European Union can combat the crisis."
"In view of that, even though they do not deny the evidence of the crisis and even refer to it repeatedly, the arguments put forward by all those who reject and seek to prevent José Manuel Durão Barroso from being chosen as President of the European Commission become mere rhetoric."
"In other words, those who think and act in that way have little or no concern for the effects of the crisis, but think only, or almost only, of gaining advantage through some kind of party political manoeuvring which, in these circumstances at least, should justifiably be avoided."
"Support for Mr Barroso from the conservative, liberal and social democrat MEPs follows his unanimous designation as the only common candidate of all the governments of the EU, both neo-conservative and social democrat."
"The anti-working class policy of the EU does not depend on persons or on the President of the Commission; it is determined above all by its very character as an imperialist union of capital."
"The political guidelines presented by Mr Barroso summarise the strategic ambitions of European monopoly capital and form the political programme applied by the political forces of the European one-way street throughout the EU, including by both New Democracy and PASOK in Greece, regardless of whether they are in government or opposition."
"The primary objective of this political programme is to shift the burden of the crisis on to the working classes, thereby ensuring that the European monopoly groups are free to safeguard and increase their profits, so that they can reinforce their position as global imperialist competitors when the capitalist economy revives following the recession."
"This objective will be achieved by adapting to the new conditions of the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy by 2020 and through an even more vicious attack on the workers' labour, wage, social and insurance rights."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0203/2009)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part One"
"Subject: Protection of the textile and clothing industries in the context of international trade"
"The grave predicament of the textile and clothing industries in certain EU Member States, including Portugal, calls for a coherent and concerted public policy strategy in favour of investment in innovation, differentiation, training and conversion."
"However, such measures also imply the need, in the context of international trade, to take the necessary actions to protect industry in the Member States, especially in the case of the more vulnerable areas such as textiles and clothing."
"What measures is the Commission taking for the protection of the textile and clothing sector in the EU Member States in the context of new free-trade agreements with third countries, especially in Asia and as in the case of South Korea?"
"What measures is the Commission taking in the context of the urgent need for market regulation in the context of trade, on a worldwide basis and going beyond regulation of the financial markets alone?"
"Member of the Commission. - We follow very closely the effects of the financial crisis on our industrial sectors, including of course the textile and clothing sector, an important and strong industry in the European Union."
"We reacted to this crisis by setting up the European Recovery Plan complemented by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Temporary Community framework for State aid matters."
"These measures have also been relevant for the textile and clothing industry: for instance, the Globalisation Fund support has been used to reintegrate workers laid off in mostly small and medium-sized enterprises of the sector in Italy, Malta, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania and Belgium."
"The textile and clothing sector comes from decades of managed trade."
"Since early 2009, trade in this sector has been fully liberalised."
"The sector has lived up to the challenge of liberalisation and has undertaken a process of restructuring and modernisation, which has not been easy."
"The sector has reduced mass production and concentrated on products with higher value added and technological content."
"Today European textiles are known in the world for their innovation and technical performance."
"The sector has been evolving successfully and has maintained a world-class export performance."
"Market access issues are therefore a priority for it, and I am happy that our renewed market access strategy has been taken up by this industry with positive results."
"And, of course, in our trade negotiations, such as the free trade agreement with Korea or the multilateral trade talks, we do take into account the sensitivities of the different industrial sectors, including the textile sector, and we aim for balanced deals."
"(PT) Just yesterday we were talking here about the problem of the free trade agreement with South Korea, and the Commissioner knows that she needs business organisations."
"I would like to tell her that I myself have met with the various business organisations in Portugal and they have told me of their great concern at the clauses of this free trade agreement with South Korea."
"There are also great concerns across Europe."
"The trade unions also have their concerns, and anyone who knows the countries of southern Europe, such as Portugal and Spain, and the areas where these industrial sectors predominate, will be well aware of how serious unemployment has become."
"In some municipalities, Commissioner, it is now over 20%, particularly in the north of Portugal."
"There are municipalities with textile mills where unemployment is over 20%!"
"We are afraid that this situation may get worse, in a country where there is already considerable poverty."
"I therefore ask you what specifically is going to be done ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"It is to Mrs Figueiredo's credit that she shows such concern about the social impact of the closure of textile mills and the damage being done to the industry."
"But will the Commissioner agree with me that the South Korean Free Trade Agreement actually provides as many opportunities for European textile manufacturers as threats, and indeed gives our quality textiles access to the Korean market?"
"Member of the Commission. - I understand very well the strength of feeling."
"This is a very important industry and I agree completely with David Martin who has studied the detail of the deal with South Korea."
"There is no doubt that we export far more clothing to Korea than they do to us, so there are real opportunities in the market."
"It is absolutely right that in thinking about everything we do on trade, we need to be mindful of the impact on industries, and that is exactly what we do."
"I would be more than happy to continue this dialogue and to provide more information about how we approach this, because I agree completely with the view that we have to support our industries through this economic recession, be mindful of the poverty and deprivation that can occur, and give new trading opportunities that will actually help boost those economies and those sectors."
"That is precisely what we are seeking to do."
"Subject: EU priorities for Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change"
"What will be the specific priorities for the European Union in the context of the United Nations Intergovernmental Conference on Climate Change which will be held in Copenhagen this coming December?"
"Member of the Commission. - This is a very timely question and I could answer very briefly that the priorities are agreement in Copenhagen for reduction commitments by developed countries, nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing countries, and finance."
"I would, however, like to say a few more words."
"We now have less than three months until Copenhagen and the climate talks have now entered into a crucial phase."
"With 250 pages of negotiating text on the table, the negotiations have not yet gathered sufficient momentum to come to an agreement that is ambitious and detailed enough."
"However, among most parties there is a sense of urgency and the willingness to focus on areas of convergence."
"The ultimate objective of the climate agreement is to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, an objective that was endorsed at the last G8 summit and the Major Economies Forum."
"We need comparable and more ambitious emission reduction targets for the group of developed countries, which in aggregate today offer less than 15% reduction as compared with 1990."
"This falls short of the 25-40% reduction required by science."
"We welcome the fact that Japan will strengthen its target."
"The EU has offered to take up a 30% reduction target if others make comparable commitments."
"Developing countries should take appropriate mitigation actions to curb the growth of their emissions to 15-30% below business as usual by 2020."
"The EU proposes that developing countries (except Least Developed Countries) design and implement low carbon growth plans containing their key mitigation actions."
"These plans would then form the basis for targeted financial and other support."
"Adequate international financing will be essential to reach an effective agreement in Copenhagen."
"Money will make or break the deal."
"We need to mobilise private investment and promote the establishment of a robust international carbon market, but substantial public funding will also be required."
"In this respect, it is worth mentioning the global partnership on technology, which aims at doubling investment in low carbon technologies."
"Furthermore, we have to strengthen support to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the increasing adverse effects of climate change."
"Last week, on 10 September 2009, the Commission adopted a communication on stepping up international climate finance, which aims at speeding up the international negotiations."
"There is a daunting task ahead of us, with intense negotiations over the coming months - but failure is not an option."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Dimas for his answer."
"Very briefly, do we know what the real position of the United States of America is, now that there is a new administration, and are they using the same reduction figures that the EU is proposing?"
"Secondly, with regard to Brazil, Russia, India and China, which are huge producers of CO2 emissions and other emissions, what role will they play, and what pressures can we in the European Union put on them to meet the same standards that we are demanding of our own?"
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, whenever we talk about climate change, we talk about measures for adapting to climate change, as well as for reducing the causes leading to climate change."
"I would like to ask the following question with the Copenhagen conference in mind: what priority is given to energy efficiency growth, including for developing countries, and also, what discussions are you having about the drinking water crisis, and obviously, the food crisis?"
"(DE) Is there an impact assessment of the changes to European competitiveness which will result from a reduction of 20% or 30% and of how that will affect small and medium-sized businesses and, above all, jobs?"
"Member of the Commission. - Regarding the United States, the new Administration has committed to reductions which are considerably more ambitious than those of the previous administration."
"However, they are still not as ambitious as those to which the European Union has committed, and fall below the level that science is telling us is required in order to keep global warming below 2°C, as was agreed by all the leaders of the major economies in July 2009 in L'Aquila, including the Americans, the Chinese and the leaders of the other countries that you mentioned."
"But the discussions in the United States are ongoing."
"The Markey-Waxman bill has been voted on in the House and is now going to be voted on in the Senate."
"There are quite a lot of provisions which need clarification, and we have to see what the net result will be at the end, because this bill could be more ambitious than it appears to be today."
"For example, if the calculation of emission reductions includes those achieved by investments in 'avoided deforestation' - depending on whether this is calculated in the United States' emission reduction target, or in the financing, or whatever - this is something which must be clarified in order to determine the comparability between the targets of the United States and the European Union and other developed countries."
"The fact is that we are encountering a very positive attitude from this Administration, we are working closely with them, and we hope that together we shall work for a good result in Copenhagen, namely an agreement with the elements that I described previously."
"Regarding Brazil, China, India, Mexico and other developing countries, of course we expect from them a reduction in the rate of growth of their emissions of the order of 15% to 30% below 'business as usual'."
"This is again what science is telling us is necessary in order to keep global warming below 2 °C. Reductions by developed countries alone will not suffice."
"Some of these countries have already taken national measures which will lead to reductions in emissions, either by energy efficiency measures or investments in renewable sources of energy, but we need to intensify our cooperation with them - exchange of information, cooperation regarding technologies and transfer of technology - in order to achieve the reductions that we need."
"Regarding cost reduction and, as you mentioned, energy efficiency, clearly all investments in energy efficiency are win-win-win situations."
"For example, by reducing the consumption of imported oil, not only do you save money, and you do not pay it to the oil-producing countries, but you also reduce CO2 emissions."
"In many countries, especially developing countries, where there are problems with air pollution - the air pollution problem in China, for example, is very well known - there will be the collateral benefit of improving air quality."
"Concerning the related problem of water and food, both of these are objectives of the European Union's policies."
"We do support policies that will improve the sanitary quality and supply of water, especially in very poor countries."
"Regarding food, we were very careful, for example, when we examined the Biofuels Directive, that there should be no competition between feedstocks for food and biofuel."
"We always take account of these important issues."
"Regarding the impact assessment and the issues of competitiveness, these were discussed at length when we adopted the Energy and Climate Package."
"Many studies have been carried out not only by the Commission but also by industry and by various sectors."
"The provisions that we have in our legislation will provide the assurances needed to preserve the competitiveness of other European industries, especially small and medium-sized enterprises by, for example, granting free allowances, in many cases up to 100% of their emissions."
"So this is something that we are taking into account and, of course, the same applies when we go to 30%."
"Additionally, if we go to 30%, it will mean that we shall have an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen where all developed countries will undertake similar comparable reduction targets to the European Union and developing countries will accept mitigation actions which will create a level playing field for the whole world."
"We shall then have comparable reduction obligations which will mean that the problem of competitiveness will not exist."
"Subject: Measures to stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies"
"The European Environment Agency recently presented provisional statistics for the year 2008 concerning the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."
"According to those statistics, emissions in the EU-15 fell by 1.3%, and those in the EU-27 by 1.5%, over 2007 levels, which represents an important step towards achieving the Kyoto Protocol objectives of an 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 over those in 1990, the reference year."
"In view of the fact that the reduction in CO2 emissions is mainly due to the increase in energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies in the transport and housing sectors, and in energy-intensive industries, can the European Commission state what concrete measures it has in mind to help the Member States stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies?"
"Mr President, the honourable member of Parliament has rightly highlighted the ongoing improvement in terms of the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases, which is due in part to energy efficiency measures and the increased use of renewable sources of energy in the transport and housing sectors."
"The Commission would point out that energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy also serve other political objectives, such as improving the security of the energy supply of the European Union, strengthening its competitiveness, creating jobs and improving citizens' standard of living."
"On account of all these benefits, the Commission is continuing to improve the legislation and programmes of the European Union in this specific sector and to provide financial support."
"(RO) Given that we have a timeframe of 10 years until 2020 and that notable results for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be achieved in the area of energy performance in buildings and the transport sector, and that we are in the midst of an economic crisis and people are losing their jobs, we must emphasise that the green economy can create millions of jobs."
"We must come up with specific solutions for specific situations."
"This is why I hope that the solution will be that you, the European Commission, will join efforts with Parliament, and we will be able to find innovative solutions for increasing investments in energy efficiency."
"Parliament has proposed interesting solutions: an increase in the European Regional Development Fund's rate from 2014, the creation of a new special fund commencing in 2014 and the opportunity to apply a reduced VAT rate, with energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies in mind."
"Perhaps you could tell us more about this."
"A simple question: how does the Commission suggest that Member States should balance the increased use of renewables with the need to keep electricity prices low for competitive purposes?"
"(DE) What investment incentives should be put in place to speed up the move to renewable energy sources in private households and not just in industrial and commercial enterprises?"
"Mr President, in answer to Mr Kelly's question, greenhouse gas emissions trading is expected to generate a lot of money for the Member States' treasuries and measures which governments can take include using some of this money to support people on low wages or people who are 'fuel poor''."
"There is therefore a way and the money is there, apart from anything else, to reply to Mr Kelly's question."
"The new Directive on renewable energy sources requires the Member States to provide support and to introduce reforms at administrative level and to infrastructures, so as to facilitate the development of renewable energy sources."
"Every Member State has undertaken to achieve certain targets by 2020 and must submit a national action plan by June next year on renewable energy, analysing how the targets will be achieved."
"As far as the review of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings is concerned, the Commission has also undertaken to provide even more Community financing and to propose new financing to support the implementation of this directive."
"The Commission is already providing direct funding for various projects relating to energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy, such as:"
"a series of research and development endeavours based on the research and technological development framework programme;"
"EUR 727 million for the period 2007-2013 under the programme entitled 'Intelligent Energy - Europe', to help remove obstacles to the development of renewable sources of energy, improve the business environment and raise public awareness;"
"over EUR 500 million for projects relating to offshore wind farms under the European economic recovery programme, to give impetus to private investment in this particular sector, and"
"the initiative to finance sustainable energy, which is being managed jointly by the Commission and the European Investment Bank, has a budget of EUR 15 million for 2009 and is designed to mobilise funds from the capital markets and the Marguerite Fund, the European Fund for Energy, Climate Change and Infrastructure, which is being managed by the European Investment Bank."
"The Commission is also encouraging the Member States to use a large part of the money available from EU cohesion policy funds to support projects relating to energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy."
"Subject: Development assistance in an economic crisis"
"In this current period, when we are having to contend with an economic crisis, is there a realistic chance of putting in place specific conditions to help the countries most affected?"
"I am referring above all to the very poor countries of the third world."
"Would it be possible to increase the aid for developing countries?"
"If our own internal problems, such as an insufficient budget or a lack of time, do not allow us to do that, then what is being done to speed up the take-up of funds that have already been assigned to developing countries?"
"My question is essentially whether it is possible to simplify the procedure for allowing this assistance to be increased."
"Member of the Commission. - Within its field of competence, the Commission has so far responded rapidly to help prevent disastrous social consequences in developing countries, in particular in the least-developed countries, most of which are ACP states."
"These measures include honouring aid commitments and leveraging new resources, acting counter-cyclically, improving aid effectiveness, sustaining economic activity and employment, revitalising agriculture, investing in green growth, stimulating trade and private investment, working together for economic governance and stability, and protecting the most vulnerable in developing countries."
"Concrete actions and procedures have already been put in place to speed up delivery of aid."
"An ad hoc 'Vulnerability FLEX' instrument will mobilise EUR 500 million from the European Development Fund."
"This V-FLEX is complementary to actions taken by the World Bank and the IMF, and will target the most vulnerable countries with poor resilience capacity, giving rapid grant assistance to help them to maintain priority spending, notably in the social sectors."
"As the V-FLEX utilises previously unallocated reserve funds, it represents additional financing for these highly vulnerable countries."
"EUR 80 million has also been mobilised for the funding under the existing EDF FLEX mechanism for countries that suffered significant export losses in 2008."
"In addition, the mid-term review of cooperation strategies for countries funded from the EC budget is currently under way, and the mid-term review for ACP countries funded from the EDF has been accelerated in order to re-define and adjust the national strategies and allocations in early 2010."
"Nevertheless, it is important to recall that development policy is a shared competence within the EU."
"The prime responsibility for delivering on the ODA commitments lies with the Member States themselves."
"I strongly believe that the crisis should not be an excuse for our Member States to water down donors' aid and promises, and I will insist on remaining committed to delivering the promised aid levels, both for EU Member States as well as for other donors."
"In this regard, we very publicly monitor Member State ODA through our annual Monterrey survey."
"On the basis of the information gathered from Member States, we foresee the EU collective ODA increasing from EUR 49 billion in 2008 to EUR 53.4 billion in 2009 and EUR 58.7 billion in 2010."
"This also means that, without additional steps by Member States to fulfil their individual targets, the collective targets for 2010 will not be achieved."
"Moreover this crisis has also shown that we have to strengthen the mechanisms for delivering ODA, as the honourable Member rightly pointed out."
"The International Aid Effectiveness Agenda embodied in the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action are now more important than ever."
"In these difficult economic times, we have a particular responsibility towards the world's poor to make sure our development assistance is being channelled effectively."
"I will defend this approach personally at the November Development Council, and the global financial crisis will be at the centre of my political concerns during the weeks ahead."
"(PL) Thank you for your explanation."
"Should the EU not be more active at international level?"
"I am thinking of financial institutions, like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which should be more flexible when determining aid levels and granting aid during the crisis."
"How can we eliminate tax irregularities and the illegal transfer of profits out of poor countries by various firms?"
"Finally, how can we fairly liberalise commercial exchange to benefit those who deserve help?"
"(DE) Particularly at times when resources are in short supply, it is important to take targeted action in order to provide the right amount of aid to the right people at the right time."
"Therefore, my question is: What future measures are planned to evaluate the efficiency and quantify the effect of economic assistance?"
"Member of the Commission. - As far as the first question is concerned, the cooperation with international institutions - the IMF, World Bank - we are working very closely together with those institutions, for example, for the vulnerability flex."
"In fact, it is together that we have been identifying the countries that should primarily take profit from this new instrument."
"We have also insisted repeatedly to the institutions to grant more loans to the developing countries and, out of the USD 280 billion drawing rights, USD 8 billion will go to the developing countries."
"So I think we are really at the forefront of influencing the international institutions going in that direction and that will also be the stance of the Commission, of Mr Almunia and me in the meetings of the World Bank and the IMF at the beginning of October in Istanbul."
"As far as the second question is concerned, I honestly think that this was the subject of my first reply."
"I detailed how this should happen."
"I am ready, of course, to repeat it, but it comes down to the fact that we especially have to pay attention that the aid is used in the proper manner."
"Subject: Demographics and development policy in Africa"
"According to a United Nations study, the population of the African continent could double to two billion by the year 2050, at which point the population of Africa would be double that of the continent of Europe."
"The average fertility rate in Africa is five children per woman, compared to 1.7 in the Far East and 1.47 in the European Union."
"What measures does the Commission intend to propose, in relation to long-term immigration and environment policies among others, to adjust external relations and development cooperation policy to take account of this data?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission shares the concern of the honourable Member that population growth in Africa and the long-term impact of high fertility rates could contribute significantly to increased pressure on Africa's natural resources and determining the development trajectory of the African continent."
"Fertility rates tell an important part of the story; according to the UN Population Division, Africa's overall population today is 8% lower than if its fertility rate had stayed at its 1970 levels."
"Indeed, its fertility rate is expected to decline even below 2.5% by 2050."
"In urban parts of the continent, an emergent middle class is having fewer children at rates comparable with Europeans."
"This story is one of promise, of the countries which have attained political stability and achieved impressive economic growth."
"Aware of these challenges, the European Commission has a development policy geared to fight poverty, promote sustainable development and tackle political challenges in order to help foster stability."
"In this field, the Commission is also bound by the strategy endorsed by the 1994 international conference on population and development, further reviewed in 1999."
"The strategy has extended the concept of family planning to that of sexual and reproductive health and rights."
"It emphasises human rights, the empowerment of women, the importance of investing in health and education and the provision of comprehensive reproductive health services to all those who need them."
"In particular, the education of women has an impact on their reproductive behaviour."
"Many studies have found a strong correlation between education and fertility; as literacy improves, fertility rates tend to decrease."
"Across all of its programmes the Commission expects to commit around EUR 1.7 billion to education for the years 2007-2013; more generally, we are firmly engaged in increasing the level and effectiveness of the collective EU aid to health systems delivering universal coverage of basic services including reproductive health."
"In this respect, under the EU agenda for action on MDGs - Millennium Development Goals - the EU has undertaken to contribute an additional EUR 8 billion, of which EUR 6 billion for Africa, to health, providing that all aid commitments are fully met."
"In order to address environmental pressure, it is of key importance to ensure that local livelihoods are sustainable."
"This means combating desertification and land degradation and enhancing agricultural productivity, halting over-exploitation of biodiversity, forests and other natural resources including oceans and inland waters; and, finally, ensuring that climate change remains within certain limits and assisting African populations to adapt to climate change."
"The Commission, together with the EU Member States, is working on an environmental integration strategy to ensure that development cooperation efforts contribute to these objectives."
"Our preparations for the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit are to be seen in this light."
"At present, the EU is working with the African Union and other regional organisations to strengthen their capacity to address environment and climate change issues."
"It promotes important initiatives to enhance forest governance, especially through forest law enforcement, governance and trade."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my question was meant to highlight one particular aspect: that global population growth has an impact both on the use of raw materials and on pollution."
"However, in developing countries this demographic increase is particularly large, with social and economic consequences too."
"My question is: would it not be possible to implement aid policies for developing countries in conjunction with family planning policies, possibly through the NGO system?"
"(DE) It is an interesting fact that two thirds of the population of Africa live in only eight of the 53 states."
"The problem of overpopulation in Africa is clearly limited to individual countries."
"To what extent are these facts influencing the development policy of the European Union?"
"Member of the Commission. - We do not have a specific family planning policy, but this can and does happen at the request of the governments concerned."
"A lot of maternal deaths result from abortions in unacceptable circumstances."
"In countries where the legislation allows abortion, the Commission will also support these programmes."
"So whether or not we take such measures really depends on the countries concerned."
"With respect to the second question; I must say that when you look at the African continent and the birth rates, as I explained in my introduction, there is a clear relationship between economic development, the degree of urbanisation and fertility rates."
"This is not a new phenomenon."
"We have seen it in all countries all over the globe."
"One can expect, with global urbanisation and, hopefully, increased growth figures, that the fertility rates might go down."
"This is not limited, as the honourable Member is suggesting, to some countries."
"It is rather a phenomenon that is linked to the development of the country concerned."
"Subject: Suspension of negotiations on free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia"
"In the light of the clear evidence that there continue to be killings of trade union activists in Colombia, and particularly in the light of the fact that in 2008, there was an increase of 25% in such killings, is the Commission prepared to recommend a suspension of negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia?"
"Member of the Commission. - The protection of human rights is of the highest priority in the European Union's relations with Colombia."
"We are therefore following the situation in Colombia very closely."
"We are well aware of the difficulties confronting trade unionism in Colombia, and the continued killings of, and threats against, union leaders and members."
"We know this from our information sources, from the reports and statements issued by international treaty bodies, as well as from my own discussions with bodies such as the European Trade Union Confederation."
"Serious concerns remain concerning the effective application of the ILO core conventions in the country."
"We are consistently urging the Government to step up efforts to protect the most vulnerable population groups and to investigate and punish all human rights violations."
"Recent attacks on human rights defenders and trade unionists have been the subject of démarches by the EU troika ambassadors in Bogotá and were also raised during recent high-level meetings between European Union and Colombian officials."
"Moreover, we have recently launched a bilateral human rights dialogue with the Colombian Government which provides a channel for a more regular and systematic exchange of information and experience in the human rights field, and will help inform technical cooperation."
"Furthermore, we are seeking to include additional guarantees in the planned multiparty trade agreement in order to improve implementation of core labour and environmental conventions in Colombia as part of the Sustainable Development Chapter."
"We are also proposing monitoring by civil society institutions on the implementation of labour laws."
"We hope that in this manner the agreement will help to improve the situation for labour rights activists in Colombia."
"I know that human rights are a high priority, and I am at a loss to understand why the European Union, which prides itself on being the champion of human rights in the world, should even contemplate a trade agreement with a regime like that of Colombia."
"Twenty-seven trade unionists have been murdered since the beginning of January 2009."
"This figure speaks for itself, and it has been proven in the past that the way to get the message across is to hurt these countries economically, as happened in the case of the sanctions against South Africa."
"I genuinely believe that we should be sending a delegation to Colombia to see the actual situation at first hand, rather than holding a dialogue with them."
"We should have people out there on the ground, and we should suspend any trade negotiations with Colombia until such time as we are assured that human rights there are on a par with the rest of the world."
"I am very pleased that Mr Higgins has asked his question."
"He is absolutely right about the situation he has described and you yourself, Commissioner, have now acknowledged the facts of the case."
"Will the Commission, in the light of this, firstly suspend their GSP+ agreement with Colombia and, secondly, suspend our negotiations for a free trade agreement, until we get the assurances from the Colombian Government that trade unionists, human rights activists and others can go about their business safely in that country?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am grateful to both, and I understand the passion and strength of feeling."
"I am not convinced that suspending negotiations will achieve what both honourable Members would wish to achieve."
"What I think we have to do is to continue the dialogue, continue working to include in our discussions and, more importantly, in our agreements, an absolute guarantee along the lines that both honourable Members are looking for."
"That is the approach that I have taken."
"It does not mean, I hasten to add, that I have not invited those who have already talked to me to continue with their contribution to making sure that we are on the right lines, and, of course, I keep it under review, but at the present time, that is the course of action I have decided upon."
"Subject: International trade recovery"
"The visible slowdown in international trade growth figures in 2008 was followed by a further contraction in 2009, far exceeding the actual extent of the economic recession."
"The European Council (Brussels, 19-20 March 2009) 'recognising that free and fair trade is a key element for global recovery', called for 'a swift conclusion of bilateral trade negotiations and of the WTO Doha Development Agenda'."
"Can the Commission provide the following information:"
"What trade funding initiatives has it taken?"
"What progress has been made by current trade negotiations and what measures are being envisaged to consolidate EU external trade flows?"
"Member of the Commission. - It is true, of course, that international trade has been particularly deeply affected by the crisis."
"The World Trade Organisation secretariat estimates that global trade will drop by 10% in 2009, with a 14% decline in developed countries and about 7% for emerging countries."
"This calls for ambitious reactions, which is what we have been doing, both on trade finance, multilateral negotiations and bilateral negotiations."
"Together with Member States, we have taken a number of important steps to increase the availability of trade finance."
"Where commercial parties were no longer willing or able to provide export finance insurance, Member States have stepped in via the export credit agencies."
"With regard to short-term insurance, this has been facilitated by the Commission decision to temporarily relax the conditions to offer such support."
"We furthermore agree to temporary relaxation of the OECD rules on medium- to long-term credit insurance."
"At the multilateral level, we strongly endorse the commitments made in the G20 context for national export credit agencies to make available sufficient government export credit insurance capacity where this is needed, and we also support the efforts by multilateral financing organisations to make available new trade financing facilities or increase the envelopes of existing ones."
"To make sure we consolidate and increase exports, we are continuing to pursue the various trade negotiations we have engaged in."
"Honourable Members know that the priority on the multilateral front is, and remains, an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive conclusion to the Doha Round, which would reap great benefits for the world and, of course, for the European economy."
"The recent meeting in New Delhi which I attended has provided new political momentum and, together with the upcoming G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, it will hopefully enable us to conclude the deal in 2010."
"We are calling for real engagement with key World Trade Organisation partners in the months ahead in order to move the negotiations forward on the basis of the package which has been tentatively negotiated up until this point."
"As Members know, we are pursuing a range of bilateral agreements in conjunction with this."
"(EL) Mr President, under pressure from the economic crisis, many states are introducing measures to invigorate their domestic industries."
"The most recent example is the decision by US President Barack Obama to impose duties on tyre imports from China."
"Has the Commission evaluated the impact on European exports of the policies of our third country trading partners, such as the 'Buy American' or 'Buy Chinese' campaigns?"
"Member of the Commission. - I have indeed been discussing with the United States and with China - from which I came last week - 'Buy American' and 'Buy Chinese' - two very different programmes; at least that is what I am reliably informed."
"I have read the legislation for 'Buy American'."
"I am concerned much more about the implementation by individual states in the United States than I am by what it actually said."
"'Buy Chinese' is a different proposition."
"I am reassured to some extent by what both the Trade Minister, Chen Deming, and the Vice-Premier, Tang Jiaxuan, said to me last week about the objective and the way in which European businesses would be treated, but I remain vigilant to make sure that neither directly nor indirectly does European business suffer."
"In terms of the current position on tyres, which I think the honourable Member is referring to, we are just watching that at the moment to see exactly what will happen."
"The honourable Member is right to point to it as an important area that we need to keep an eye on and see what happens and obviously I am happy to keep in touch on that."
"In the absence of Mr Moraes, I am afraid Question 27 falls."
"Subject: Marketing European beef and lamb products"
"What measures is the European Union pursuing to help market the sale of European beef and lamb products in third countries and does the Commission intend to bring forward any new initiatives to help in this process?"
"Member of the Commission. - We work actively to tackle what are very complex vital sanitary barriers, and with this to help market the sale of European products like Irish beef and lamb."
"The Market Access Strategy, and particularly the Market Access Partnership launched in 2007, is the centrepiece of the Commission's work in that respect."
"The Market Access Strategy sets up a stronger partnership between the Commission, Member States and business to enhance the work of detecting, analysing, prioritising and removing barriers."
"The specificity of this strategy is that it is done through the right mix of various trade policy instruments."
"That means using multilateral and bilateral channels and complementing the more formal medium to long-term policy instruments with political contacts and with joint trade diplomacy."
"Our efforts in relation to this market access have been stepped up considerably in recent years, and we have several success stories to show we are going in the right direction."
"For example, we managed to confine a few countries and lift the ban on EU exports of meat due to the dioxin and PCBs contamination incident in Ireland in December 2008, and recently we were successful in opening Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Philippines to the import of EU beef and to treat certain SPS issues in a more trade-friendly manner with Egypt and Israel."
"We keep insisting on the different levels with countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea, to bring some of their legislation fully in line with the requirements of the SPS agreement and of the international standards of the World Organisation for Animal Health."
"We have asked EU beef businesses to come forward with their specific concerns and to make suggestions on how we might tackle barriers in key markets."
"It has recently had very positive feedback, and a presentation made by an Irish business association will help us in setting priorities and continuing our work."
"Can I ask the Commissioner if she would consider a thorough and full examination of the food promotion budget?"
"It has been in operation since the 1970s, is very restrictive and needs to be reformed."
"Furthermore, would the Commissioner agree that improving the competitiveness of the European Union food sector will help the European Union pull itself out of the economic recession?"
"It is well known that European beef and lamb products comply with the highest standards."
"What measures is the Commission taking, if any, to encourage or demand that similar standards apply to trading partners, particularly in Brazil?"
"Member of the Commission. - First of all, I am not familiar with the particular area that the honourable Member mentioned, so, if I may, I will come back to him in writing about that."
"However, I agree completely on the question of the value and importance of the industry to the European Union and to trade."
"Indeed, it is an area where we have increasingly to look and focus."
"I work very closely with Commissioner Fischer Boel when looking at trade agreements to make sure that the agriculture side of our agreements represents a real strength and a real opportunity."
"I hope that, as our negotiations unfold, the honourable Member will see more of the value that we place on this."
"In terms of the reciprocity principle, we are negotiating with and training third-country officials so that they understand what the EU system is, so as to build their confidence in the level of protection offered to EU consumers and to their consumers alike."
"We insist that third countries respect their international obligations, notably the World Trade Organisation SPS agreement, making sure that, when setting requirements, they respect international standards or base their requirements on science."
"Subject: Environmental damage caused by lignite mining in the Czech Republic and central Germany"
"What view does the Commission take of the environmental damage caused by opencast lignite mining and lignite-burning power stations in the Czech Republic and central Germany, and of the progress with plans to decommission lignite plants and return affected land to nature?"
"Mr President, the environmental damage which may be caused by the mining and use of lignite in power plants is an issue which is adequately addressed under Community legislation."
"Under the Mining Waste Directive, units which process mining waste must have authorisation which includes a waste management plan and a plan for the closure and rehabilitation of facilities."
"These units have to provide a financial guarantee to cover the cost of rehabilitation of the land."
"The directive makes provision for inspections to be carried out by the competent authorities and includes obligations relating to the prevention of air, water and land pollution."
"The directive has applied to new facilities since May 2008."
"Facilities which already existed must obtain authorisation, in accordance with the directive, by May 2012."
"The Member States must also prepare a list of abandoned and decommissioned facilities which cause or may cause environmental damage by mid-2012."
"The regulatory framework of the European Union also includes other directives, such as the ΙPPC Directive and the Large Combustion Plant Directive."
"As far as environmental liability is concerned, the Land Directive is before the Council, but has not progressed."
"Of these, the most important is, of course, the ΙPPC Directive, which requires large combustion plants to obtain an authorisation based on the application of best available practices."
"At the same time, the Large Combustion Plant Directive sets minimum limit values on emissions for the most important atmospheric pollutants."
"If a plant ceases to operate, the ΙPPC requires the operator to take measures to prevent any risk of pollution and to take measures to rehabilitate the area."
"This legal framework safeguards a high level of environmental protection in the event of possible environmental damage from lignite-fuelled plants."
"Now, as far as the closure of plants is concerned, this will be judged depending on whether plants comply with statutory requirements."
"(DE) Thank you for your accurate and comprehensive answer."
"However, I did also ask specifically about the border areas, in other words Germany and the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, Poland and the Czech Republic."
"There are many of these cases in these areas."
"I would like to ask whether you believe that there is sufficient cross-border cooperation between the relevant states and whether the Commission is providing support for cross-border measures in these areas, in particular as part of the regional programmes."
"Mr President, first there are various sources of financing, both for the Czech Republic post-2007 and for Germany."
"I must, of course, also remind you that, with the energy and climate package approved last December, there will be sufficient money from the scheme to trade greenhouse gas emissions which, under the agreement reached, must be reduced by 50% in order to combat climate change and other related uses."
"This means that facilities, especially outdoor lignite mining facilities, by definition destroy the environment and nature with various problems caused not only to the natural state of the land, but also to water from other pollutants and, as we know, from the generation of large quantities of carbon dioxide, given that lignite is, from this point of view, the worst fuel."
"On a scale from one to ten, it is perhaps one of the worst in terms of carbon dioxide emissions."
"I should like to say that money can also be obtained from emissions trading and, as far as Germany in particular is concerned, I have to say that emissions are being traded even as we speak."
"Consequently, there is also money from this source."
"However, apart from that, I should like to say that there is Community financing which can also contribute to the restoration of environmental damage from mining activities."
"The regional operational programmes for the period 2000-2006 funded projects to regenerate areas which had been badly affected by the mining of brown coal in certain federal states in former East Germany, such as Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia."
"Provision is made for this type of support to continue in the relevant programming documents for the 2007-2013 period."
"As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, the North-West regional operational programme for the period 2007-2013 finances actions to regenerate and rehabilitate abandoned mining areas."
"The 'Environment' operational programme also makes provision, as one of its priorities, for the regeneration of abandoned mining areas and, of course, cooperation not only between countries, but also between regional organisations, benefits both sides."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."

"G20 Summit in Pittsburgh (24-25 September) (debate)"
"The next item is the comments of the Council and the Commission on the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, to be held on 24-25 September 2009."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to be here today representing the Swedish Presidency."
"The Presidency and the Commission will jointly represent the EU at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh on 24-25 September."
"We will hold an informal European Council in Brussels tomorrow to prepare the EU's common position."
"As you will all be aware, the global financial crisis has necessitated unprecedented global measures:"
"Firstly, rapid and forceful financial and monetary policy measures to support the financial sector and the real economy."
"Secondly, coordination of global efforts and development of the role of the G20 as a forum for such coordination, including for measures concerning regulation of the financial markets."
"The financial and monetary policy measures that were able to be taken quickly were entirely necessary to get us through the worst of the crisis."
"The overall support to the EU economy this year and next year is estimated at 5% of GDP."
"The central banks have responded to the crisis by keeping interest rates close to zero."
"Today we are cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us as far as the acute problems of the financial sector are concerned, but the economic situation remains unstable and there is a considerable risk of further setbacks."
"We are very aware that rising unemployment will be a very dominant issue in the time ahead."
"The situation remains uncertain, but it could have been much worse."
"Coordination and cooperation at international level will be incredibly important if we are to ensure a broad recovery and to set the tone for a return to long-term, sustainable growth based on a firm foundation."
"The G20 has played, and will continue to play, a central part in this."
"The G20 will also work with the international financial institutions of the IMF and the World Bank to guarantee that they have sufficient resources and a well-functioning internal organisation so as to be able to support economic growth and ensure financial stability throughout the world."
"The G20 process has had the following significant results:"
"Firstly, that we have a common analysis of the problems that have affected our economies."
"That may not sound like great progress, but a shared view of the financial sector and the real economic problems that lie behind the crisis is essential for effective countermeasures."
"Secondly, we have made real progress with a number of specific measures that we agreed on in London at the spring summit."
"These include a comprehensive stimulus package for our economies and a strengthening of cooperation on the supervision and regulation of the financial markets."
"Furthermore, we have ensured that the International Monetary Fund has sufficient resources to meet demand for borrowing."
"We have also undertaken to improve the ability of the international financial institutions to give warning in good time should similar problems arise in the future."
"Much remains to be done, but we have made clear progress that has been driven forward by coordinated international commitments."
"I feel that we in the EU, along with the other members of the G20, have made great progress on a number of central issues that are crucial if we are to provide a strategic response to the economic and financial crisis."
"Our coordinated EU strategy means that Europe is leading the debate, rather than following it."
"It is our solutions that are being noted when global solutions are drawn up."
"That is why the Presidency is inviting the Heads of State or Government to a dinner tomorrow evening."
"The aim is to build further on the successful work of the informal Ecofin lunch and the meeting of G20 finance ministers in London, so that we will be well prepared on arrival in Pittsburgh."
"I expect the meeting tomorrow and the summit in Pittsburgh to continue to result in progress on the main issues that I have mentioned, but also in a few other areas besides."
"One issue that has been raised in strong terms by a number of European finance ministers is the question of the part played by bonus systems in financial stability."
"EU finance ministers are unanimous that we should lead demands for effective global standards to ensure that such bonus systems do not have destabilising effects and that the bonus payments are reasonable in relation to performance."
"This is an important part of the overall initiative to ensure greater transparency and better supervision of the financial sector and it is crucial if we are to be able to secure future stability."
"The Financial Stability Board has been asked to report to the Pittsburgh Summit regarding its work on developing principles for bonus systems."
"I hope that this report will contain specific strategies that can be implemented in practice and which guarantee the introduction by financial institutions of sensible, responsible remuneration and bonus structures."
"Moreover, I hope that we can agree to continue to provide the necessary stimulus to our economies as long as it is needed, but it is also important that we undertake to remove the measures when they are no longer required so that we can return to balanced public finances when the recovery comes."
"We have only just begun to reflect on these exit strategies."
"Their form and coordination, and how they are implemented, will be a highly important component if we are to achieve a balanced, long-term economic recovery."
"Employment is another major challenge."
"We need to carefully design the measures required, while at the same time maintaining a good balance between financial and structural policy."
"I am sure that we will also repeat the need to maintain a stand against protectionism and to ensure fair play on the global markets."
"This will require significant coordination of financial regulation and supervision, but also as regards the removal of extraordinary measures taken to support the financial sector."
"Extensive work will continue to be required both at national and EU level."
"Discussions concerning reform of financial institutions will continue tomorrow and in Pittsburgh, but also during the rest of the year."
"We want them to be strong, with sufficient resources, the right mandate, with political guidance and management structures that correctly reflect their composition."
"These matters are complex and interlinked, but we must get to grips with them as a matter of urgency so that the financial institutions can do this work which is becoming increasingly important."
"Finally, I would like to say that naturally there is a great need for political decisiveness if we are to make progress in the discussions ahead of the climate summit in Copenhagen."
"This is a very high priority for the Swedish Presidency."
"We want to ensure that the right incentives are in place for everyone to take action to limit global warming and to adapt economic strategies so as to favour climate-friendly development."
"Our goal is for the Pittsburgh Summit to make progress on guidelines for financing global climate measures."
"I cannot promise that we will achieve everything we want to, because these issues are highly complex, but we promise that the Presidency will assert and defend the EU's views in a responsible manner."
"In this spirit I look forward to fruitful discussions with the Heads of State or Government tomorrow evening and the real results that the world is expecting from Pittsburgh next week."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, this is my first time before the House in this new legislative term."
"I want to start by congratulating all of you on your election, or re-election in many cases."
"I am sure that we all share a sense of responsibility with regard to tackling one of the greatest political challenges of our generation: how to overcome this deep economic and financial crisis."
"We have to restore confidence and stability for our citizens, while increasing their opportunities and ensuring the highest possible level of social cohesion for everyone."
"The issue that will be on the table at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh next week is at the heart of this challenge and this concern."
"I am convinced that this issue will keep coming up throughout the next period and throughout this Parliament's legislative term, regardless of whether these issues are discussed at G20 summits or European Councils, in your own debates or in the proposed initiatives that the next Commission will bring before this House."
"The G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is the third to be convened at the level of Heads of State or Government since the collapse, one year and one day ago, of Lehman Brothers and the start of a crisis of proportions not seen for many decades."
"In light of the first two top-level G20 meetings in Washington last November and in London in April of this year, it is clear that the G20 is playing a decisive role in coordinating the global response to this crisis."
"The G20's contribution to the development of a coordinated response has been vital in avoiding an even deeper recession than the one we are currently experiencing."
"It has also been vital in establishing the foundations of an economic and financial system that will, in the future, prevent a repeat of the imbalances and excesses that have led us to the current situation."
"The European Union has played an active and decisive role in encouraging the G20 in this respect."
"As recalled yesterday in this House by President Barroso, the first summit in Washington was a European initiative by the French Presidency and President Sarkozy, together with the Commission."
"The European Union also made a decisive contribution in terms of setting ambitious objectives for the two previous summits and actively participating in the preparatory work for these summits, in order to achieve not only declarations of principle, but also concrete results and commitments."
"All Europeans, as well as the European institutions, should feel satisfied about all this."
"We can also be reasonably satisfied about the level of coordination that has existed between the various European representatives on the G20: the European countries that are G20 members and participate in the G20 meetings as such, plus the Presidency of the European Union together with the Commission, the latter representing the voice of all Europeans and the common position of all Member States."
"The Washington Summit last November allowed the world's main economies - the G20 countries account for around 90% of world GDP - to agree on the implementation of stimulus plans to support economic activity at that time, last autumn, when credit, international trade and investment came to a sudden halt as a result of the tremendous financial shock, which first occurred in August 2007 and which then gained incredible momentum in September 2008."
"A few days after the Washington Summit last year, the Commission proposed the European Economic Recovery Plan, which received the political support of the European Council in December."
"This plan has formed the basis of the European response in terms of fiscal policies and policies to stimulate demand through instruments which are in the hands of national governments and parliaments, or which are in the hands of the European institutions themselves."
"Based on the most recent information available, these discretionary fiscal stimuli, together with the action of the automatic stabilisers, which are very important in the European countries due to the weight of our taxes and social welfare system, are predicted to add, as a contribution to total demand, the equivalent of 5.5% of EU GDP between 2009 and 2010."
"The new US administration has also adopted a very significant stimulus plan."
"Given that its automatic stabilisers are not as extensive as ours in Europe, the total sum of direct stimuli plus automatic stabilisers means that similar support is being given on both sides of the Atlantic."
"In addition, countries such as Japan, China, Canada and other G20 members have also adopted equivalent fiscal stimuli."
"The London Summit at the beginning of April insisted, in this respect, on the need to quickly put these plans into practice."
"It called for close monitoring of these plans and said that, if necessary, they should be supplemented by additional measures."
"We can now confirm that these stimulus plans, together with the very significant monetary stimuli adopted by the central banks, plus the mobilisation of public resources in support of financial institutions, particularly the banks, have managed to halt the economy's freefall."
"They are also now allowing us to see, this autumn, the first signs of stabilisation, as is apparent from the economic forecasts that I had the opportunity to present two days ago in Brussels."
"For the first time in two years, these forecasts have not revised the previous forecast downwards."
"However, we are not yet able to say that economic activity could sustain itself if these stimuli were removed."
"It is also true that, even with the stimuli that are being applied, there are risks of a relapse given the extremely worrying rise in unemployment and the as-yet unresolved weaknesses in the financial system."
"As a result, one of the messages that the G20 Finance Ministers agreed on with regard to the Pittsburgh Summit, when they met in London at the beginning of this month, was the need, for the time being, to maintain the temporary support measures, without ignoring the need to start developing a coordinated exit strategy."
"I will come back to this briefly at the end of my speech."
"The first two G20 summits in Washington and London were also decisive in terms of setting a global agenda for reforms in the systems of financial regulation and supervision."
"It may be said that we are witnessing a radical change in tone after nearly three decades dominated by the model of deregulation and theories on the alleged infallibility of the financial markets."
"In Washington, the G20 countries established the foundations, laid down the principles and defined the agenda for subjecting the financial markets to stricter and more effective regulation and supervision, leaving no areas, products or financial players outside the control of the regulatory and supervisory authorities."
"These authorities must cooperate and coordinate their actions with one another much more closely in order to rectify the evident ineffectiveness of national supervisory systems vis-à-vis globalised markets and financial institutions operating across borders in these markets."
"Extensive work was carried out at the London Summit in April to bring about concrete and significant progress in the implementation of this reform agenda."
"From prudential accounting rules, applicable to financial institutions, to the firm requirement for transparency in non-cooperative jurisdictions, namely tax havens, and including the regulation of hedge funds or other financial institutions, the organisation of transparent derivative markets, and the adoption of rules on the pay of senior executives of financial institutions and traders operating on the markets, the London G20 Summit took definitive steps towards fulfilling the promise of reform."
"As a result, the European Union has performed a very important task not only in promoting these agreements at G20 level, but also in applying these G20 agreements."
"This has involved intensive regulatory work over the last year."
"Some of these proposals have already been adopted here in this Parliament and by the Council."
"Others are currently being discussed in this House and by the Council and, by the end of the year, the Commission plans to adopt another series of proposals, starting next week, one day before the Pittsburgh Summit, with the proposal to create the European Systemic Risk Board and three European micro-supervisory authorities, based on the recommendations of the de Larosière report, which both the Council and the Commission have taken on board."
"The US administration has also revealed an ambitious financial reform plan, which President Obama confirmed this week as a priority of his term of office."
"He has recognised the responsibility of the United States as being the place where this crisis was born and developed."
"The objectives set for the Pittsburgh Summit include checking on the positive progress of these reforms and ensuring the necessary regulatory convergence on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Any regulatory divergence will or could be used in the future by investors for arbitration strategies, which could once again create major distortions in the markets."
"However, in addition to ensuring compliance with what has already been agreed and encouraging the implementation of the measures adopted, the Pittsburgh Summit must send out a clear political message."
"The absolute desire of governments, political leaders, institutions, our own countries and the European Union to establish a solid regulatory framework with a firm commitment and dissuasive message must now be made clear."
"This message must say that 'no one should think that, having got over the worst part of this crisis, those former practices which led to the crisis can be allowed to redevelop, as if nothing had happened'."
"The public expect guarantees that the financial institutions and their executives will be required to comply with rules, particularly on pay, which will prevent them from once again endangering the financial system and the real economy as a whole."
"It must be said that the European Union is totally united on this point."
"Another issue that has been high up on the agenda of the various G20 summits is the reform of the international financial institutions, as already mentioned by Mrs Malmström."
"The only point I wish to add is that an extremely important step forward was taken in London in terms of the financial capacity of these institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"Its lending capacity has been increased by no less than USD 500 billion, as a result of which the total funds now available to the IMF for its operations are USD 750 billion."
"In addition to that, it was agreed to distribute between all the IMF's member countries, in proportion to their quota, special drawing rights amounting to USD 250 billion."
"On top of that, it was also agreed to increase the IMF's financial capacity in order to boost its concessionary loans to the poorest countries."
"All that is already in hand."
"A great deal more progress has been made in the space of six months than over many years before that."
"As a result, the European Union has, of course, agreed to duly contribute to this increase in the IMF's funds."
"The Member States of the European Union have agreed to add EUR 125 billion to their usual contributions, in proportion to the financing of the new objectives."
"The G20 leaders will also discuss changing the representation of the various countries on the governing bodies of the international financial institutions."
"Emerging and developing countries quite rightly aspire to a more appropriate representation."
"This is an aspiration that the European Union supports, but it must be translated into concrete agreements."
"That is why the European Commission - although this is not the official position of the Presidency of the European Union - continues to say that, in line with what this Parliament has thought to date, the best representation for the European Union on these bodies is a single representation."
"The Pittsburgh Summit agenda will also cover other issues: financing of climate change, in preparation for the Copenhagen Summit; the need to resume international trade negotiations and not to give in to protectionist tendencies; and increased support for the weakest and most vulnerable countries in tackling this crisis."
"As you know, the Commission adopted a communication on the financing of climate change last week."
"Finally, please allow me to conclude by mentioning the wish expressed at the last meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers, and which will be discussed at the Pittsburgh Summit: the need to establish the foundations of a future model of more balanced and sustainable growth."
"This will firstly involve developing exit strategies, not to be applied immediately, but to be applied when appropriate and in a coordinated manner."
"This is because the development of such strategies is not only key to a sustainable exit from this crisis, but also to offering, at the same time, a prospect of medium-to-long-term sustainability following the profound effect that the crisis has had on public finances, on levels of employment and on the capacity for growth of our economies."
"Mr President, Minister Malmström, Commissioner Almunia, we are in a global crisis."
"We have a financial sector that operates on a global basis and we therefore need, as far as possible, to agree binding rules for the sector on a global basis."
"That is why the G20 in Pittsburgh is so important, though the European Union itself should, of course, take vigorous action."
"Efforts must be focussed on restoring the balance between freedom and responsibility, the values that form the basis of our social market economy, the core of our electoral platform in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Mr President, the G20 Summit is an important summit where it is more than vision that will be needed - I am happy that you have said so too."
"It is a summit where decisions have to be taken."
"This relates to structural reformation in risk management, more transparency and better rules for financial supervision."
"Commissioner Almunia, you said that there are proposals in place for hedge funds."
"What do you hope to achieve in this regard at the G20 Summit?"
"A rapid reform of the IMF and the World Bank is also very much needed, and - I am pleased that you have both said this too - there must be timely work on a coordinated exit strategy, or new problems will arise once again."
"Mr President, it is of the greatest importance that the flawed bonus culture be tackled with binding rules, as bonuses that reward short-term profits pose a great risk to the stability of financial institutions."
"That is not all, however, as there is rightly a great deal of public indignation and, for that reason, too, it is very important that we show ourselves to be decisive in this regard."
"Mr President, the summit will only be a success if binding agreements are reached."
"I have talked about financial regulation, but climate change, preparing for a successful Copenhagen Summit and fighting protectionism in the interests of jobs are, of course, very important issues."
"You, the European Union, all of us together, must play a pioneering role in this regard, and it is therefore important that you get the Member States to pull together."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, there can be no 'as you were' in the current economic situation."
"That will only allow us to make a slow recovery and we shall see a further dramatic increase in unemployment figures, including here in Europe."
"You must therefore be bold."
"That is the most important message this Parliament can give the Pittsburgh delegates."
"Be bold!"
"Mr Almunia, I have listened to a refreshing speech from you, on which I should like to congratulate you."
"Now you need to start putting it into practice."
"It is good to start with the bonus systems, but it is not enough."
"We need a gear shift wherever short-term speculators are at an advantage on the international financial market, because the rules are wrong, over those who wish to make long-term investments in jobs, in products of excellence and in the long-term success of their company."
"It is right to say that no risky players, no risky financial centre can remain without reasonable regulation, which is why we need regulation of the offshore centres from which dubious products are flooding the entire world."
"That is the most important task that we must now set ourselves."
"Nor should you be frightened of discussing fiscal policy - it is not prohibited."
"A global transaction tax which benefits long-term investors would take us forward in this discussion as a whole."
"We need strong, improved coordination of our international, as well as our European, economic policy."
"It is right to think about an exit strategy, but it is even more important at the moment that we work out how we can give more solid support to the economy and improve the coordination of our economic policy."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, we clearly appreciate all the efforts that you have mentioned and which have, in fact, already gone quite far, but we want more."
"We want a number of the G20's elements and commitments to be formalised."
"In particular, I would like to draw your attention to the gap between the rather encouraging figures in the financial sector and the terrible unemployment figures in the European Union."
"If we have long-term unemployment, we will have, firstly, a human tragedy, and also a burden on public finance and no hope of a recovery through consumption."
"We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, very much fear a Japanese scenario and a sort of sluggish growth for several years."
"I think that your country, Mrs Malmström, Sweden, has unfortunately also had experience of this."
"Please help us to take advantage of this experience."
"For me, there are three essential tasks."
"Firstly, we have to carry on cooperating internationally, and carry on fighting against protectionism and strengthening global institutions such as the IMF."
"We cannot get out of this on our own."
"Europe must hammer home this message tirelessly."
"Secondly, we must successfully put in place effective supervision and a much more demanding form of bank stabilisation."
"In this respect, we should be wary of the G20's publicity stunts."
"There are executive powers, but there is work to be done at a legislative level and, for us, Mr Almunia, the Commission's proposals on supervision are a step in the right direction, but they are not enough."
"Ultimately, we want more European entities."
"Then I think we will have to consider joint strategies for exiting the crisis while preserving the euro, making sure that the deficits do not place a strain on common monetary discipline."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia for saying that he was in favour of the European Union as a body adopting positions in international institutions, thus defending the Community method."
"We are counting on you to make sure that it is not only the large States that make their voices heard, but that the whole of the European Union and the whole of the internal market are defended."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his speech."
"I have several concerns."
"The first is that the Committee on Development in this House drafted a motion for a resolution."
"I quote from that. It 'notes with great concern that the crisis already bears major human costs, and has devastating effects for the vulnerable in the poorest countries with an expected increase of 23 million more unemployed, up to 90 million more extreme poor in 2009 alone, life-saving drug treatment for up to 1.7 million people under threat, and 200 000-400 000 more infant deaths per year on average between 2009 and 2015'."
"Unfortunately, this motion was not passed, although it was written together by all groups of this House."
"We strongly deplore and we think it is a shame that this House was not able to draft a resolution on the G20 on development issues."
"The big question is how to finance the consequences of the crisis, and there the German Minister of Finance, together with the Chancellor, suggested that the G20 discuss the possibility of a global transaction tax."
"I ask the Commission, and I also ask the Presidency of the Council. Do you support this proposal?"
"The second question is about tax havens."
"The G20 wants to tackle it on the basis of case-by-case information exchange."
"We know that this will not work."
"The Development Committee suggested a country-by-country reporting regime so that transnational corporations have to report back on a country-by-country basis."
"We suggest introducing automatic information exchange so that information really flows between the different countries."
"A global financial system needs transparency."
"We also want to know your position on these concrete proposals to get out of the crisis and finance the consequences."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, thank you for the speeches we have had this morning."
"I was particularly pleased to hear Mrs Malmström's comments about the G20 Pittsburgh representatives needing to agree to significant coordination in the continued support of stimulus measures, in the unwinding of these support measures when appropriate, and a determined coordinated effort on future regulation."
"However, the backdrop to this summit is nations spending trillions of dollars on bailouts and stimulus packages and in two of the largest world economies we are seeing some protectionist measures, particularly with regard to tyres and poultry, as well as two of the most complicated regulatory structures in the world, namely the EU and the US, looking to completely overhaul their financial systems."
"Therefore, I hope that the important issues of how to coordinate financial services, particularly now that some countries are showing early signs of coming out of this period of negative growth, will be the main topic of discussion and not the distraction of controlling bankers' bonuses."
"This summit should focus on how we achieve a common regulatory framework in a common timescale so that we do not create an opportunity for competitive advantage by individual nations or regulatory arbitrage opportunity for speculative trading."
"There will be no first-mover advantage in financial regulation."
"A global, coordinated approach is the only one which would benefit the businesses looking to raise funds in Wales, the EU and beyond."
"If my Welsh businesses cannot access funds from the US, if the banks they rely on will require so much capital that the taxpayers of the EU need to take even more risk, we will not be thanked for moving first on overly burdensome regulation."
"My plea is that a global, coordinated approach is adopted at all times and maintained to ensure the future access to capital for all our businesses in Wales, the EU and beyond."
"In Portugal, bank profits grew by 18% in the first quarter of this year."
"The only thing that rose more than bank profits was unemployment."
"Portugal is not an exception, but an example of an unfulfilled promise made by the G20, which was that we would resolve this crisis with a new economic and world order."
"That is not true, and 50 million more people out of work and 200 million more people in poverty prove that it is not so."
"That is why I call on the Commission and Mrs Malmström to deal with bonuses and hedge funds, certainly, but most of all to deal with what we have not mentioned here: the end of off-shore banking, tax havens, the tax on financial transactions and the end of banking secrecy."
"They should do anything that can be seen if they want people to believe in them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how can the people have faith in financial market regulation when it is entrusted to the high priests of the global financial temples such as Mario Draghi?"
"In the United States, a popular uprising, a new conservative revolution of the people against the financial oligarchies, is taking place."
"We the people do not believe in making taxpayers fund policies to rescue the financial powers, whether in the United States or in Europe."
"Rather, European governments should give adequate resources to the real economy; they should worry about production and jobs."
"We can see the results of the G20: they include nothing about ceilings and bonuses, nothing about the elimination of tax havens!"
"The measures are instead aimed solely at rescuing those responsible for the financial bubble: EUR 23 trillion have already been spent, EUR 5 trillion of which were spent by the European Central Bank."
"The money in our economy has been gifted to those responsible for the financial bubble."
"In comparison with the EUR 850 billion given to the banks, only EUR 50 billion has been earmarked for welfare support provisions and production incentives."
"The reality is that high finance gives the orders and politics obeys them."
"In the United States as in Europe, politicians appear merely as servants of the global banking power."
"Wake up, Europe!"
"Follow the example of the US population, which is starting a second major revolution: the conservative people's revolution!"
"(DE) Mr President, we need democratic revolution."
"That is clear from this process, which has luckily gained momentum with what is presently the G20, because more may join; one could even imagine a G3."
"How would it be if the Council helped in establishing a democratic control mechanism, especially given its tradition of consensus?"
"It need not be a world parliament straight away, but what is being promoted needs democratic scrutiny by elected parliamentarians within a far bigger forum than the European Parliament."
"I should also like to specifically point out that the question of systemic risks must be approached at its core."
"With reference in particular to the tiresome situation we keep finding ourselves in, starting back in 1998, with LTCM, Hypo Real Estate and, of course, Lehman, and the knock-on effects, rules should emerge from this that make it impossible to end up with the basic problem of 'too big to fail'."
"This can, of course, be done through cartel legislation, but it is certainly also a fundamental global question."
"As far as a global transaction tax is concerned, the Tobin tax group was set up here in the European Parliament back in 1999."
"It is good that there has been progress here."
"As far as the supervisory package is concerned, we urgently need to act on a European scale and not to allow ourselves to be held back by those who want the wrong Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics are improving."
"However, the multiple causes of the crisis - and it is not just a question of loopholes in regulations - are far from being removed."
"For that, political will, decisiveness and courage must not fail us; on the contrary."
"Today we are talking about the G20."
"It is a good process."
"We need new or different structures, priorities and bases for valuation in order to build up a global economy and a financial, social and judicial order in the world."
"There are three conditions for this: firstly, we need to develop a democratic, parliamentary legitimisation process; secondly, we need more EU in Europe and more Europe in the world, which also means that the values of our Charter of Fundamental Rights are our export articles, that our model of a responsible eco-social market economy is the basis for our global order and, thirdly, European regulation is needed in areas in which no agreement is in sight within the framework of the G20."
"We say yes to integrated European rather than simply coordinated financial market supervision on the basis of the model of the European Central Bank."
"The de Larosière report is too little."
"We say yes to the debate on bonus payments, but changing the payment methods is not the right way to go about it."
"We must change the basis for assessment and, wherever there is a bonus, it must also have a penalty component."
"As far as I am concerned, the debate on pro-cyclicity is too brief at the moment."
"We need to remove the procyclic effects of the crisis and the current regulations for 2009 and 2010."
"The political will must not fail us."
"That is why, following the speeches of the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner, we are going to Pittsburgh with optimism."
"(FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, one year on from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the position that the European Union adopts at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh is absolutely critical if we want to prevent a repeat of past events and want the dynamic of change to remain at the top of the agenda."
"I have four observations on this matter."
"Firstly, at the G20 Summit in London last April, the Heads of State or Government made a commitment to increase the IMF's funds."
"Very well."
"We have seen that there was significant support to fulfil this objective."
"I fear that behind this there has been less determination to play a part in the much-needed reform of the governance of the IMF."
"My second observation is that we must not fall for gimmicks."
"I would not like the omnipresent debate on the bonuses and salaries of both CEOs and traders - which is absolutely critical if we want to develop the system into one which focuses less on the short term and more on long-term investment - to overshadow what is an equally important campaign concerning the eradication of tax havens, which was the highlight of the London Summit."
"My third observation - and this picks up on what Mr Bullmann said earlier - is that this is an historic moment for us to raise the question again of the banks' contribution to financing the aftershocks of the crisis."
"This will enable us to reopen the debate on the taxation of transactions, which itself must also allow funds to be made available for long-term investment."
"Once again, given the way the banks have been supported and assisted to cope with this crisis, the only right, proper and effective course of action is for them to contribute today to the financing of the economy."
"My final observation is that, when we look at the employment picture, I think that from the start, our G20 meetings have fallen short when it comes to tackling the macroeconomic question, the question of a global pact for employment, and the question of a return to a strategy which, tomorrow, will enable us to correct the global imbalances that caused this crisis."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fast and decisive reaction of the G20 to the global financial crisis."
"A great deal has happened."
"The fire appears to have been put out, but the foundations of our financial system are still shaky."
"The citizens are unsettled."
"Profits are being ploughed back for the benefit of shareholders and losses are being socialised, that is how the citizens see it."
"In the meantime, it is back to business as usual for more and more market players, who are making big moves, rather than focusing on what they should really be doing as service providers, namely supporting the real economy."
"Financial ethics and responsibility appear, as ever, to be foreign words to many of them."
"I am expecting specific - and fast - measures from the G20."
"I hope that the EU Member States will all pull together."
"In addition to new supervisory structures, we also need bigger equity bases, which increase in line with the risk, long-term - not short-term - incentive systems, a coordinated exit strategy from State aid, contained protectionism, congruent regulation, rather than regulation arbitrage, an end to pro-cyclicity and a solution to the 'too big to fail' problem and, above all, we must abide by the tried and tested social market economy."
"Mr President, so far the G20 has concentrated on measures for the financial sector."
"However, everyone seems to forget that the real economy also suffers from greed and an obsession with short-term profits."
"I have deep respect for small enterprises which, against all odds, try to survive."
"They deserve to get the loans to which they are entitled."
"However, I have no respect at all for the management of some of the bigger companies which have no affinity with the products or services they deliver and can only think in terms of expansion and speculation."
"I therefore call upon the G20 to discuss ways of making the economy more democratic and how to make sure that, within the company, workers and others who represent the general interest have enough power to control the management."
"Within the EU, we have to look again at the statute for a European company."
"We should make sure that it becomes impossible for shareholders and management to engage in speculative growth strategies to the detriment of the long-term interest of the companies themselves and of those who work for these companies."
"Mr President, the majority of Europeans are not corporate leaders and not bankers but family farmers, small entrepreneurs, state employees."
"The majority of Europe is completely fed up with the present system, in which global multinational corporations and banks rule the world."
"They need, and they want, a fundamentally new paradigm, in which there must be a shift from globalisation to localisation, from completely profit- and money-centred decision making to human-centred and community-centred decision making, from WTO-ruled free trade agriculture to food sovereignty, local production and local farming."
"Please do not fail to represent at the G20 Summit the views of the majority of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, who should regulate whom and how?"
"That will be one of the controversial questions at the G20 Summit."
"Even if there is unanimity on the fact that there can be no return to unbridled developments on the financial market, the methods and extent of regulation are still the subject of fierce argument."
"It will still be possible to reach agreement on equity rules, on rating agencies, possibly even on questions in connection with derivates and their licensing, but there will be argument on the question of unfair competition, taxes and control."
"There will be arguments over bonuses and there will be arguments over Europe's demand for a Tobin tax."
"In other words, as Europeans we have a responsibility to do our own homework, regardless of the outcome of the G20 Summit and the Commission is on the right path by not relying solely on it."
"The motto must be: no financial market players, no financial products and no financial centre with no supervision in future."
"However, global economic recovery is also on the agenda."
"We cannot carry on here as in the past and maintain the imbalances in the world for the benefit of the US and for the benefit of the large industrial countries."
"We must devote ourselves to overcoming poverty and hunger in the world and the G20 Summit must give new momentum to this."
"I should like to add one point that no one, with the exception of Commissioner Almunia, has addressed so far."
"It will be necessary to abide by the Stability and Growth Pact in Europe, not to bury it."
"It is only because we had this pact, because we revised and maintained it, that it was at all possible for Europe to remain capable of action."
"This should remain a European objective: a fast exit strategy out of excessive debt into a stable economy, to the Stability and Growth Pact as we know it."
"(MT) Mr President, currently, one of the most popular topics, at least on the news tied to the G20 Summit, is that of bonuses."
"It is evidently a much talked about issue, yet we have to understand that the actual problem is rather more complex."
"What has to be said is that if these bonuses are to put the financial system at risk then, undoubtedly, they must be checked."
"However, we must keep in mind that there were large deficits in the external trade between countries that led to this crisis, as well as other internal fiscal deficits."
"We must also take employment into consideration."
"We know that the employment lag approximately requires about a year or so to catch up with the impact of previous GDP performance."
"Therefore, when analysing employment issues, fiscal stimulus packages that are applied must keep being applied until positive results begin to emerge."
"The Commission should ensure that there are no inconsistencies and should require that a reduction in deficit be registered before doing so."
"(EL) Mr President, the G20 Summit, the main topic at which was bonus management, does not by any stretch of the imagination get to the root of the problem and, unfortunately, is not a step towards improving the present system."
"The series of proposals to amend the regulations is confined to an analysis of superficial issues and does not focus on social objectives."
"The objective should be a total overhaul of the financial system and public and social control, a more democratic summit which would include all states and would address issues such as increased unemployment and the spiralling cost of basic goods and fuel, a summit which would take fundamental decisions to intervene in the market in order to put a stop to continual privatisation and the destruction of the social state."
"These are the people's real needs."
"Citizens today want overall structural change, far from a neo-liberal system which leads to under-development instead of development, far from the rampant speculation which works against the people's interests."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your determination."
"Europe has begun to put in place effective regulation, but Europe must not find itself isolated."
"Close international cooperation is necessary, and this is exactly what we expect of the G20."
"It must pursue the reforms, which were initiated at previous meetings, with rigour and vigour."
"The international framework for regulating the financial sector must be completed, so that it can aid investment, growth and employment."
"Guiding principles must be affirmed."
"The crisis is not over."
"We must not return to the situation ex ante and abandon measures needed to avoid, as far as possible, the renewal of crises which are particularly damaging to the real economy, growth and employment."
"The strengthening of supervision and regulation is equally necessary."
"The obligations for supervision should reflect the level of systematic risk that the financial institutions impose on this sector."
"Speculative activities, which represent a significant risk, should be discouraged by increasing the capital requirements and applying the Basel rules internationally."
"As for salaries in the financial sector, we should recommend pay committees, increase transparency of these salaries with stricter disclosure requirements and supervise variable salaries, notably bonuses."
"The strengthening of global financial institutions is likewise an imperative, as is the reform of governance and representation at the IMF."
"Commissioner, these are some of the expectations citizens have of the next G20, where Europe must speak with one voice, with determination and conviction."
"(ES) Commissioner Almunia, Mrs Malmström, I would ask you not to forget in Pittsburgh that we are experiencing not only a financial and economic crisis of unprecedented dimensions, but also a huge social crisis with devastating effects on those most in need, on those who only have their job, on small entrepreneurs, and on the most disadvantaged regions and countries."
"I hope it is made clear in Pittsburgh that the economy is important, but that people are more important and that the economy serves the people."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, Minister, please do not forget in Pittsburgh that Europe exists."
"Please make your voices heard above those of the three tenors."
"I have here the letter of 3 September from the three European Prime Ministers."
"There is not one word on Europe."
"They say that it is important that Europe speaks with one voice, but they keep drowning out Europe's voice."
"You must speak louder than them."
"You must make clear that Europe has a right and an obligation, and that our vision of the social market economy is the solution to this crisis, and to preventing its reoccurrence."
"(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points that have been made, but must qualify some others."
"I agree that it is too soon to take away the patient's crutches, but that it is time to get him ready to walk without them."
"We still have to absorb excess liquidity in the markets, correct the imbalance in public finances and re-establish respect for competition rules."
"In Pittsburgh we must do several things that we cannot do alone: we have to set up early warning mechanisms that work, because those that we had did not work; we have to revise the regulatory framework, because the existing framework has not worked."
"I agree that it is important to regulate bonuses and tax havens."
"These are all necessary, but inadequate, measures."
"In my opinion, it is more important to re-build the muscle of financial institutions, limit debt and set up reserves in good times so that we can weather the bad times."
"It is more important to make an effort in terms of supervision."
"The Commissioner knows that I supported the de Larosière report, although I felt it was inadequate, because I would support more centralised supervision."
"However, it is clear that European supervision cannot function without close coordination with the supervisory authorities of the other major economic areas of the world."
"We also need to do something about trade."
"It is all well and good helping the emerging countries, but it is more important to lift the barriers that are still preventing trade in goods."
"Commissioner, the most important point is that we need to establish the foundations for stable and sustained growth over a generation."
"For this we need free markets, markets open to innovation, markets open to entrepreneurs, but also markets subject to a certain level of regulation."
"I will end with a quotation, which will be familiar to my compatriot Mr Almunia: 'Publish not many edicts; when you do enact pragmatics and decrees, see that they be good ones and, above all, that they are well observed', so said Don Quixote to his friend Sancho."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner."
"I especially agree with him on his Charter for Sustainable Economic Activity."
"I think this is what we must take to the G20 but I do not agree that we should use all our capital to focus on bankers' bonuses."
"I think this is a distraction in many ways although it should be dealt with."
"Neither is a wish list for solving the world's problems frankly likely to win the day."
"The financial services industry is on fire."
"We need first to make sure that we have put out that fire and that it stays out."
"For this we need a consistent approach."
"The G20 is a leading forum, but we also need permanent structures in place as well like the Transatlantic Economic Council to deal with issues like IFRS."
"If systemic risk is to be truly dealt with, we need to stop looking in the rear-view mirror and start focusing on the road ahead."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through is profound and long lasting."
"It is therefore urgent and absolutely essential to put in place the necessary regulations and supervision of the financial sector and the banks, to prevent an even more drastic repeat of today's crisis."
"The financial system must once again serve the real economy and not continue to destroy it."
"From this point of view, the last G20 Summit in London, which has been mentioned, ended in what were, to say the least, partial proposals, but, above all, the words have not been turned into deeds, and the financial drift is there once again."
"In view of this situation, and so that the Pittsburgh G20 Summit really is useful, the European Union must defend strong regulatory measures that have real consequences."
"Beyond the essential measures to supervise finance listed by a number of my fellow Members, I personally would like to raise the issues of trade and development, because in Pittsburgh there will also be talk of relaunching the Doha Round."
"Relaunch it, yes, but with the condition that the initial and central objective of this Round, that is to say development, is not sidelined again."
"Our southern partners, quite rightly, will not accept that their concerns continue to remain unanswered."
"The issue at stake in this G20 goes beyond that of the financial crisis: it is about laying the foundations of new global governance."
"(ES) Mrs Malmström, Mr Almunia, I will give you three ideas in one minute."
"Firstly, we need more Europe."
"This is because, given the global situation, Europe must be united and strong."
"If we fail to achieve this, Europe will not count and will not be involved."
"Secondly, we need more State."
"This is because, in addition to developing a new governance for the world, in addition to new regulation and supervision, and also greater international coordination, we need to put an end to tax havens and review transnational taxation."
"This, in my opinion, is an urgent issue for the future."
"Finally, we need a better market."
"I feel it is vital to reiterate the need for new business ethics and also the need to encourage a new culture of corporate responsibility."
"I believe this is essential."
"Companies must become part of society and, as such, must be held liable to these interest groups and to these stakeholders."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Mr Almunia, first of all, on 3 September, Germany, the United Kingdom and France reached an agreement, spoke with one voice to express a European consensus on the matter of the supervision of traders' bonuses."
"On Thursday, the 27 members of the Council will meet to prepare for the G20."
"I encourage you to work actively to find a solution, a common response, but one that is especially ambitious as regards the matter of traders' salaries."
"Indeed, the rules enacted and the decisions taken at the last G20, in April, have not been respected, as the banks, which had also received State aid, swiftly set aside sums to pay traders."
"European citizens cannot and would not understand why such breaches have not been punished, when measures were taken at the time of the G20 Summit."
"When it is a matter of State aid, breaches absolutely must be punished."
"It is therefore essential that concrete and, above all, joint measures be adopted at Pittsburgh."
"We cannot be the only virtuous ones."
"In short, salaries must be better supervised through rules of transparency, governance and responsibility, and penalties must be applied where these rules are breached."
"(SK) In my opinion, what you have presented here is a rather ambitious plan, which you want to present to the G20."
"I am concerned, however, as to what the conclusions of the G20 will be and what the real effects will be on society, since the results that have filtered through at the level of EU Member States are so far neither tangible nor visible."
"Mrs Malmström was saying that the issue is one of proportionate levels of pay for managers, but it must be said that all of the data indicates that it is precisely in those sectors which we supported financially and which we protected from ruin that managers receive disproportionate levels of pay."
"In addition, nothing has happened with offshore banking - the mechanism has simply not been brought into play."
"All of this leads to mounting unemployment and problems for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in my opinion, we should perhaps focus on fewer issues in the future while ensuring that those issues we do focus on are implemented in full."
"(FR) Mr President, you spoke of the governance of the IMF."
"I would also like to know if you intend to raise the issue, at the G20, of the conditionality of the money that the IMF lends to states."
"We have seen that what were previously very liberal conditions have not been changed, and this applies in particular to the loans that were granted to some European States."
"What is your position on this?"
"My second question is: what is the position of the Commission and the Council on the Chinese proposal to put in place a slightly different international currency, in an effort to regulate the financial system using an alternative to the dollar?"
"My third question is: the G20 is also part of the preparations for Copenhagen."
"The Commission has proposed a total sum of between EUR 2 and 15 billion to help the countries of the South adapt to climate change."
"What is the Council's position?"
"What sum will you put on the table at the G20 next week?"
"Mr President, the G20 came up with many sensible responses: the need to rewrite financial regulation and supervision, and the need to act in a coordinated fashion."
"Our national politicians are saying one thing, but here in the EU we seem to be doing another."
"The detail of the regulation that is already being considered by some of my colleagues shows divergence both in the timetable of implementation and in the detail of the regulation."
"Our economies are still very fragile."
"Unemployment is rising, and access to finance is a huge concern, especially for small and medium-sized businesses."
"Do we want our British or European businesses to be at a competitive disadvantage when they need working capital?"
"Do we want to make it so expensive to borrow from a European bank that our customers, our corporates, just go and borrow from Wall Street and end up handing another coup to Wall Street at the expense of European banks?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to approach this subject from one of the perversities of the crisis."
"Hungary's citizens were shocked that, while the country is currently subsisting on aid from the IMF and EU, following seven years of socialist government, Hungarian banks' half-year profits reached two-thirds of their pre-crisis level."
"The banks are also able to amend unilaterally their agreements, thereby putting in a vulnerable position citizens who have taken out foreign currency loans in the hope of buying their own flat."
"I firmly believe that we must take action against such trends."
"We should subject the banks and other financial market operators to proper supervision."
"We should prevent the continuation of the damaging bonus culture prevalent before the crisis."
"We should set in stone rules of professional ethics because we have seen where we end up with excessive deregulation."
"Let us create a world which gives rewards, not for making a quick, short-term profit and immoderation, but for proper work, and which regards social responsibility as a basic value."
"We must work together on sensible rules to win over our G20 partners."
"(HU) There is a clear message from what has been said so far, namely, that in order to regain the trust of ordinary citizens, we must take action against bonuses and tax havens."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Almunia and Mrs Malmström about when the European financial supervisory authority proposed by the Hungarian Prime Minister will come into operation."
"I would also like to point out that it would be an extremely important task for this Parliament, nothing to do with G20, to protect the interests of European consumers and citizens."
"They are completely at the mercy of the banks, which do not provide sufficient reliable information."
"A code of ethics has been drawn up in Hungary."
"I would suggest a code of ethics in Europe at EU level, governing the behaviour of citizens and banks, because I strongly believe that there are a huge number of innocent victims as ordinary citizens do not understand the risk entailed when obtaining credit."
"This is an extremely important task for Europe."
"(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the very ambitious programme you have presented to us is interesting, but do you not think that we ought to tackle the issue of the advantage that is still to be gained, today, by favouring very short-term transactions and very short-term profitability over the medium and long term?"
"The lack of funding for our businesses, particularly in Europe, is precisely due to the advantage that is still to be gained by very short-term investments."
"Do you not think we should tackle this issue?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who have contributed to this debate."
"I feel there is a very high level of agreement in this House about what is important in the European position and which issues we must concentrate on ahead of the G20."
"The EU now speaks with a clear, coordinated voice on the international stage and I really would like to thank the Commission and, in particular, Joaquín Almunia, for the work that he has done to help bring about this consensus."
"Many Members have raised the issues that both I and the Commissioner have looked at."
"Yes, we need better supervision and better regulation of the financial markets."
"We hope that a supervisory system can be put in place as soon as possible."
"We will base this on the Larosière report and see how quickly we can get it into place."
"We need more coordinated global solutions and effective and functioning international institutions."
"We need clear principles for bonus systems."
"I have great faith in the Financial Stability Board and I am confident that it will come up with specific realisable proposals that we can discuss."
"We would also like to take up the matter of climate financing."
"We will call upon all countries to shoulder their responsibilities, but I am not sure that it is realistic to expect to be able to discuss figures at the summit in Pittsburgh."
"Naturally, we will work towards this, because it would be a good thing."
"We also need global solutions."
"We cannot separate EU solutions from this system, but instead must ensure that we get as many global solutions in place as possible."
"Unemployment is perhaps the most noticeable aspect of the economic and financial crisis to the people of Europe."
"Unemployment is here to stay for some time in most of our countries and that is a very, very serious situation."
"It calls for European and national solutions."
"We must have a strong labour market policy, we must make it easier for companies and entrepreneurs to take the risk of employing people and to dare to invest and we must ensure that people are employable by investing in education and research."
"We will be having a special discussion on unemployment at Ecofin in October."
"We also have to discuss exit strategies. Otherwise, there is a risk that the measures that we have taken will have negative effects on unemployment and growth in particular, and will result in deficits and inflation."
"It is always the most vulnerable in our society who suffer first."
"When it comes to the poorest countries, we are very, very aware that it is they who are the biggest losers in the international crisis."
"It is hitting the poorest in the world hard."
"We have discussed and are continuing to discuss how we can ease the situation of these people."
"It is important that the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) have sufficient resources to be able to provide what are known as soft loans."
"It is also important that we ensure that the international trading system works properly and that there is no protectionism inherent in it."
"Consequently, the various discussions concerning global taxes and various kinds of Tobin tax are only meaningful if they can actually be realised globally, and at the moment that is not the case."
"As a result, they would only be counterproductive and would not help our economies."
"Many Members have raised the matter of hedge funds and new financial regulation."
"These are priority issues for the Swedish Presidency."
"We will decide these matters alongside you and we look forward to working very closely with the European Parliament to get directives on hedge funds and financial regulation in place as soon as possible."
"I am aware that it is difficult and complex - that there are many aspects to take into consideration - but we are prepared to work with you as closely as possible to get this in place."
"In summary, naturally the G20 Summit cannot solve all the problems that we have discussed."
"Nonetheless, I have good reason to hope that we can make substantial progress on the issues that we have discussed."
"There is pressure from the citizens of Europe, but there are also people around the world who expect us to demonstrate our leadership and increase the stability of the financial systems, to do our utmost to avoid this type of crisis in the future and ensure that we come out of this crisis stronger than we went into it."
"The EU is united, the EU is strong, and I can assure you that the Swedish Presidency will do its utmost to defend and assert the views of Europe at the G20 Summit next week."
"Thank you very much for a highly interesting debate."
"Mr President, I believe we are all agreed that, in the current situation in which we still have to tackle huge and extensive challenges as a result of the crisis, the success of the G20 Pittsburgh Summit and the belief that, as a result of these meetings, we will start to find and apply solutions to the problems and challenges facing us, are extraordinarily important."
"We are, in fact, starting to see some significant signs of improvement in certain economic indicators, particularly in the growth of international trade and in the confidence of consumers and investors."
"As a result, all the items on the summit's agenda should be, must be and I hope will be agreed by the Heads of State or Government and implemented following the meeting next week."
"One of the most important points, mentioned by many of you, is the need for clarification, for a clear message as to how the world's major economies intend to keep coordinating their actions."
"The next step in the coordination of economic policy must be to define an exit strategy and commit to a decision as to when and how this strategy will be applied in a coordinated manner."
"We must learn - and I believe we have learnt - the lesson from the crisis of the twenty-ninth that the stimulus measures cannot be withdrawn too quickly, when the economy - as some of you have said - still needs crutches."
"However, we must also not use these stimulus measures for longer than necessary because, in that case, we would be repeating the conditions that led to the bubbles and imbalances which were the cause of this crisis."
"This is a very important issue, which must be clarified by the Pittsburgh Summit."
"We must avoid repeating the errors of the past, not only in terms of macroeconomic policies, but also in terms of financial regulation and supervision."
"I believe that this commitment has been made very clear at previous summits."
"We must keep developing this commitment and honour those undertakings already made at both global level and, as in our case, at European level."
"In this respect, I agree with those who have said in this morning's debate that not everything should be reduced to the issue of pay."
"However, I also fully agree with those who say that the issue of pay is extremely important in economic, social, political and ethical terms."
"I believe that Europe is showing its leadership on this issue - as it has done on other issues on the G20 agenda - both through each of the Heads of State or Government and also through the European institutions themselves, the Presidency of the European Union and the Commission."
"We should not forget that, in April of this year, the European Commission presented the Member States with recommendations on pay, which are almost exactly the same as those that the whole world is now proposing."
"We must continue to pay attention to the problems of the financial system - more capital, restructuring and correction of bank balance sheets - at both the European and global levels."
"When you have a fully interconnected financial system, there is no point in us solving our problems within our borders if no one else is solving their problems at the same time."
"You must remember how, one year ago, on the day before the Lehman Brothers crisis, we still thought that we could avoid the worst problems of the financial crisis created in the United States."
"At the same time, it is absolutely true, as many of you have said, that, in the end, the political objective is not just to sort out the balance sheet of one bank or capitalise its liabilities."
"The fundamental problems are employment, the situation of our small and medium-sized enterprises, and the sustainability of our public services and social welfare systems."
"However, without a functioning financial system, nothing else can be sustained."
"That is the challenge that must be tackled by the Pittsburgh Summit, or which the G20 must continue tackling at the Pittsburgh Summit."
"Finally, I should like to comment on an issue that was raised in many of your speeches."
"While I agree with other items on the G20 agenda, which many of you have mentioned, I want to refer to just one: the issue of tax havens and non-cooperative jurisdictions."
"It is true that the G20 meeting in London failed to find solutions to all the problems posed by tax havens."
"It would be very difficult to find all the solutions in one day to a problem that has been around for many years."
"However, it is also absolutely true that, since the London Summit in April, many more problems have been solved over these six months than were or could have been solved over many years before the London Summit."
"On this particular point, agreement has been reached on the exchange of information needed to prevent tax avoidance and to prevent economic and financial activities being hidden from the public authorities by utilising the protection of tax havens."
"It is therefore true that not everything has been solved in these six months."
"However, in these six months, we have achieved a great deal on an issue which is very important in terms of preventing those financial activities, which are hidden from the regulatory and supervisory authorities, from once again creating distortions in the system."
"This is also extraordinarily important in terms of the message that we are sending to our citizens about the distribution of responsibility and the efforts needed to tackle this crisis."
"Lastly, someone said that the EU's voice must be heard above the voices of the European members of the G20."
"I can assure you that, under the Swedish Presidency and using the voice of the European Commission, the EU's voice is being heard."
"It is being listened to very attentively and respectfully because Europe, and not just one or two European countries, but the European Union was the organisation that started this process of global coordination."
"This clearly shows that more effective results can be achieved when there is true coordination."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first October part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is expected that the approaching G20 Summit will place a predominant emphasis on the Copenhagen climate talks."
"There are still many undecided questions standing in the way of a post-Kyoto agreement."
"Allow me to express a few thoughts I have on this subject."
"Number one. Instead of vague long-term promises, we need binding medium-term undertakings."
"These undertakings must be realistic, fair and accountable."
"When establishing these undertakings, apart from factors like economic development and natural assets, it is important also to take into consideration the extent to which the Kyoto commitments have been fulfilled so far."
"Number two. Support should be given for the notion that the EU should assist the developing countries financially as well in achieving their climate policy objectives."
"A specific financial pledge is needed to achieve this."
"However, in order to ensure transparency, the developing countries must also make binding commitments and draw up detailed action plans."
"Number three. Flexibility mechanisms must continue to be given an important role."
"In order to promote investment, agreement must be reached as quickly as possible on the way in which the certificates deriving from the projects carried out so far can be included."
"Number four. Market-based instruments must be given more scope in the post-Kyoto system."
"For example, extending the emissions trading or green certificate schemes may help achieve a reduction in emissions in places incurring the minimum cost."
"I believe that the economic crisis is not an obstacle to the Copenhagen compromise."
"A decent medium-term agreement may somehow boost the European economy's competitiveness, while also reducing the burden on the environment."
"Five years ago, on their accession to the EU, every new Member State committed to adopting the euro."
"At present, four of them have already achieved this."
"The other countries have drifted and are lagging behind in this area due to various economic policy considerations and mistakes, not to mention that the economic and financial crisis has put them in a vulnerable position."
"The economic downturn has fuelled protectionist ambitions, which threatens to undermine the operation of the single market."
"The current economic crisis has highlighted the fact that the euro has assumed a prominent role in the close economic ties established with the euro area members, but the States hoping to adopt the euro have now ended up in an extremely vulnerable position due to the protracted preparations."
"Many believe, myself included, that in the critical currency situation that has evolved, the key to the solution would be to speed up the introduction of the euro for these Member States."
"However, economic policy conditions must be stipulated for this, but even with the previously stipulated conditions it would still take years for the euro to be introduced."
"In my view, we should not only check that the convergence criteria have remained unchanged, but that the EU is also handling the regulation governing the time which must be spent in the ERM II exchange rate mechanism in a more flexible manner than it does now."
"I also think that it is very important to examine how the process for joining the euro area could be accelerated, while fulfilling the conditions which can be fulfilled."
"This could then stabilise the situation in the affected countries, not to mention safeguard the EU's entire internal market."
"Otherwise, the possible international insolvency of the countries outside the euro area may, in a worst case scenario, bring down the euro area with it as well."
"Mr President, the market economy is a good slave but a bad master."
"Recently, though, the roles have become rather confused."
"It is the custom at international conferences to speak trivia, but now we need action, and fast."
"The world now has a historic opportunity at the Pittsburgh G20 Summit to agree once again on the rules of the global economy."
"There has been a lot of talk in the press about bankers' bonuses, but they are only the tip of the iceberg."
"The global economy is in need of complete renovation and the keyword is transparency."
"We have to try and do away with the risk economy and move towards the real economy."
"Only binding international rules can guarantee that there will be no repetition of the casino economy we have witnessed in recent years."
"In future, the taxpayer should not be made to pay for the damage."
"There is always the risk with mechanisms like wealth taxes that someone in the global economy will turn out to be a freeloader."
"I think, however, that we should at least look into how relevant they might be."
"The G20 Summit in Pittsburgh will be taking place practically on the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank."
"This is the background against which world leaders should operate."
"The repercussions of the crisis have been felt by the inhabitants of almost every part of the globe."
"The primary aim of the G20 Summit should be to minimise the risk of the crisis caused by the deregulation of the financial markets from repeating itself."
"The G20 leaders face the task of creating regulation which will prevent further speculative banks from emerging and, to put it bluntly, swindling millions of customers of financial institutions all over the world."
"In the last few months, we have been getting increasingly bad news about managers who brought their firms to the brink of collapse consuming public aid."
"In the last few years, we in Europe have been witnessing an unprecedented income gap not previously seen in the European social model."
"One of the tasks of the G20 group should be to level out incomes in Europe and on a world scale."
"The financial sector needs to have rules making bonuses dependent not on short-term profits, but on long-term returns on investments."
"The leaders of several European countries as well as of the European Union as a whole will be present at Pittsburgh."
"That is why Europe should speak with one voice at the summit."
"I appeal to the representative of the European Union to remember that the interests of the Community include the interests of Member States which will not have national representatives at the summit."
"On Monday this week, it was a questionable honour to work on what is a sort of anniversary: exactly a year before, the investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed."
"The collapse is regarded as having actually precipitated the current deep global recession and the financial crisis."
"At a point in time so close to the anniversary and the approaching Pittsburgh G20 meeting, it is worth stopping to reflect on what has been learned and what can still be learned from the crisis."
"I see something crucial emerging from the crisis, and that is an opportunity to overhaul thoroughly the international financial architecture."
"There have already been steps taken in this direction."
"The G20 meeting last spring served as a good basis for action and guidance for global consensus on the measures required."
"The United States of America very recently announced a huge financial legislative package."
"The European Commission is expected to make a proposal for building the European financial architecture and its supervision next week."
"The key phrase here is 'global approach'."
"We have to establish internationally binding rules on the reform of the International Monetary Fund, regulations on solvency, and new rules on the payment of options."
"The legislation must extend to all financial products, and it needs to be flexible so that it can always react to a changing sector, and one that launches new products."
"In the grip of a crisis that is wrecking people's basic security, livelihoods and welfare, it is also constructive to think about new ways of measuring wealth."
"The final conclusions published by the commission that President Sarkozy recently appointed recommend a switch from measuring prosperity based on GDP to new methods which take account especially of a society's ability in economic terms to safeguard its citizens' well-being and environmental sustainability."
"in writing. - I agree with those who spoke about the need for a global co-ordinated approach."
"This is essential if we are to change the power structures of the global financial system."
"However neither the Commission or the Council made comment about the concept of 'living wills' for the banking sector."
"This week marks the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman brothers."
"It is estimated that it will take ten years for the investment bank to be wound up."
"This is in contrast to the Dunfermline Building Society which had a life will enabling its assets to be clearly identified."
"Transparency is essential if we are to bring consumer confidence back to the banking sector."
"SWIFT (debate)"
"The next item is the Council statement on SWIFT."
"Mr President, in the overall fight against terrorism, the key question is how are such activities financed."
"Preventing the financing of terrorism and tracking clues that such transactions may leave behind can both prevent terrorist crimes and be important in the investigation of such crimes."
"In order to do this, we need international cooperation."
"Here, we should take up the challenge laid down in the UN's 1999 Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the conventions of the European Council in this area."
"Members who participated in the in camera meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 3 September 2009 heard how the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme, the TFTP, has helped to improve security for EU citizens as well as others."
"In recent years, information from the TFTP has contributed to revealing and investigating terrorist crimes and has also succeeded in preventing terrorist attacks on European soil."
"The Presidency was given a unanimous negotiation mandate by the Council on 27 July 2009 that is based on a proposal from the Commission."
"It would have been better if the negotiations with the US could have taken place on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Parliament could then have participated fully, but as you are aware, that is not yet possible."
"Since SWIFT is moving its database from the US to Europe at the end of the year, it is essential that the EU concludes a short-term agreement with the US as soon as possible so that there is no risk of the exchange of information being interrupted."
"That is in everyone's interest."
"I would like to stress that this is an interim agreement for the period until a permanent agreement can be concluded."
"It must have a term of no more than twelve months and the Commission has advised that it intends to submit a proposal for a permanent agreement as soon as a new Treaty is in place."
"If the TFTP is to be of use to the EU and the Member States, the US must continue to provide the respective authorised authorities within the EU with information from the TFTP in the same way as previously."
"This is indeed what will happen."
"Moreover, the interim agreement will provide an express opportunity for the EU's crime prevention authorities to request information themselves from TFTP databases in the investigation of terrorist crimes."
"The Presidency is convinced of the benefit of information from the TFTP."
"At the same time, we are clear that the interim agreement must contain the necessary mechanisms to guarantee the protection of individuals' privacy, the rule of law and data protection."
"The draft agreement therefore contains a provision stating that there must be a separate EU authority to receive, process and approve any request from the US to obtain information from SWIFT."
"It is equally important that the interim agreement contains detailed provisions on data protection for the information that the US receives from SWIFT via the European authority."
"Here, the agreement will go further than was previously the case in the unilateral commitments to the EU made by the US in the TFTP representations of 2007, as published in the Official Journal of the European Union."
"Allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement."
"Data must be stored securely, all access to data shall be logged, all searches in the TFTP database shall be restricted and shall only cover persons or information where there are good grounds for suspicion or there is a clear link to a terrorist crime."
"The storage period for the information reviewed shall be limited and information shall be deleted from the database after five years at most, or earlier if possible."
"We can clearly state that the TFTP will be permitted to be used only in investigations of terrorist crimes, including the financing of terrorism."
"Neither the US nor the EU may use the system to investigate other kinds of crime or for other purposes."
"Naturally, it is also important that the transfer of information from the EU to the US under the TFTP is proportionate."
"In addition to the rules concerning the European authority that I mentioned previously, the agreement therefore also contains a provision stating that the system must be appraised by an independent appraisal body."
"Where the EU is concerned, this body will consist of representatives of the Presidency, the Commission, and two people from the Member States' national data protection authorities."
"The task of the appraisal body will be to check compliance with the agreement, to check the correct application of the provisions on data protection and to check that the transfer of data is proportionate."
"We have a common responsibility to ensure that the crime prevention authorities can counter terrorism effectively."
"We also have a common responsibility to ensure that this takes place with legal certainty while respecting fundamental rights."
"The Presidency is convinced that the exchange of information with the US within the framework of the TFTP increases protection from terrorism, and that we can achieve both an interim agreement and eventually a long-term agreement which not only meets our stringent requirements of data protection but which also respects fundamental rights."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I would firstly like sincerely to thank Mrs Ask for giving us a summary of all the developments concerning SWIFT and of the negotiations under way with the United States on the continuation of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme, the TFTP."
"I myself had the opportunity, during the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 22 July, to explain the workings of the TFTP and why we need an interim solution to prevent its interruption."
"The joint meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 3 September took place with the Swedish Presidency, the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security, Mr Faull, and Mr Bruguière in attendance."
"I believe that this meeting allowed a number of still open issues to be clarified."
"I would like briefly to underline some aspects."
"The added value of the evaluation, by the US Treasury, of data within the context of the TFTP has been confirmed by Mr Bruguière's report, which the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were able to examine at the joint meeting at the beginning of September."
"As the Presidency has also reminded us, this analysis of the data has enabled the US authorities to prevent attacks and to facilitate investigations concerning terrorist attacks, both in the United States and in Europe."
"Moreover, Judge Bruguière's report confirmed that the US authorities had honoured the commitments they made in 2007 regarding data protection, namely - as Mrs Ask explained very well just now - to limit data preservation and to limit access to the data, so that they are used only where terrorist financing is suspected."
"In short, Mr Bruguière said that the commitments have been honoured."
"It is clear, however, that the judicial framework negotiated in 2007 will no longer be operational since the data will no longer be located in the United States, after the change in the architecture of SWIFT, scheduled for the end of the year."
"An interim international agreement between the European Union and the United States is needed so that the US authorities can continue to analyse data concerning inter-European transactions taking place in the Netherlands."
"The inclusion in this agreement of all the guarantees necessary to safeguard the fundamental rights of our citizens, notably that of the protection of personal data, is absolutely imperative."
"Of course, we support the Presidency wholeheartedly in its efforts to that end."
"Moving on, I would like, above all, to say to the House, Mr President, that, as the Minister has just mentioned, we are talking about an interim agreement, the duration of which cannot exceed a maximum of 12 months."
"This means that it can be renegotiated immediately once the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, with the full involvement of the European Parliament."
"I can genuinely assure you, here, that the Commission will, of course, continue to keep Parliament constantly informed of the progress of this matter."
"I would add that we are pleased to be able to prepare this agreement, which will be a permanent agreement, a long-term agreement, by demanding, of course, full reciprocity from our US partners."
"The fight against terrorism concerns us, too, and there is no reason why there should not be full and complete reciprocity."
"That is why I believe the involvement of Parliament in this negotiation of a future long-term agreement will be beneficial."
"That is what I believe in all honesty."
"I would once more like to thank the Swedish Presidency and Mrs Ask for giving us a thorough overview of the situation, which has today given rise to this, once again, interim agreement."
"Mr President, Mrs Ask, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the US is an important partner in the fight against terrorism."
"However, on the question of sensitive data in particular, we want European regulations on data security, on civil rights and on the individual rights of our citizens as far as data is concerned, in cooperation with the Americans."
"That is why we in the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) are calling for a number of basic criteria for concluding this sort of contract."
"Firstly, there must be a balance between civil security and civil rights."
"Secondly, we need legal certainty for the companies concerned and for our citizens."
"Thirdly, we welcome the co-legislator role of the European Parliament and therefore also welcome the intention of concluding a transitional agreement."
"We wish you, Mrs Ask, and the Commission, success here in the coming weeks."
"Fourthly, we believe that internal European data sets should be handled in accordance with European law, both in the transitional agreement and in the final agreement."
"Fifthly, we want a similar instrument to the TFTP, to be introduced in addition at EU level, and, sixthly, we are of the opinion that this is the precondition to reciprocity."
"These are our thoughts and we trust that they will meet with a broad consensus in plenary."
"Once the transitional agreement has been concluded, we will need to negotiate and conclude the final agreement quickly."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, SWIFT has clearly become a testing ground for getting the balance right between our cooperation with the United States, fighting terrorism and protecting our fundamental rights."
"When, in our resolutions of 2006 and 2007, Parliament asked for the mirroring site of SWIFT to be moved from US to EU soil, it was obviously because we thought that the protection offered by the US framework to EU citizens was not in line with EU standards and would have to be improved."
"So it is a positive development, and our group welcomes the fact that SWIFT's two new servers will now be moved to Europe and that a new legal framework will be set up in order for the US TFTP to continue using and processing data in cooperation with our law enforcement authorities."
"My group can also see that the recommendation adopted by the Council tries to address some of Parliament's and the European Data Protection Supervisor's concerns."
"But there are some key questions left open."
"If US legal standards continue to apply on EU soil for the processing of EU data, how can we guarantee respect for EU standards regarding procedural rights and the protection of personal data?"
"To which judge can an EU citizen or an EU enterprise go in the case of criminal prosecution?"
"Of course, one of the most important issues is the timing of the agreement and the interim nature of the agreement, as the Council and Commission have set out."
"The choice of a third-pillar legal base, coupled with its interim character, leaves Parliament - and, therefore, EU citizens - completely out of the legislative process."
"The Socialist and Democrat Group is clear that this interim agreement should apply only for 12 months and that a new agreement should be negotiated with Parliament as co-legislator so that we in this House can ensure that delicate balance of protecting the fundamental rights of European citizens in the important and critical fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, after all these warm words, I am going to put a cat among the pigeons!"
"I am not going to say anything about the content, as I think it is self-evident that what has been negotiated is in line with European standards of legal protection and the protection of personal data, but I do now want to get a couple of answers about the process, as this is the umpteenth example of the Council taking decisions affecting citizens behind closed doors."
"The governments of Europe and the United States want to know everything about our private lives, but we, as citizens, do not get to know what the Council does."
"For me, that is a little bit back-to-front."
"The fight against terror has practically become a kind of runaway train, with the Council showing utter contempt for European citizens and parliamentary democracy."
"Every time, whether the current case relates to Swift, PNR, data retention or whatever else, we are told that 'this is indispensable to the fight against terror'."
"I dare say, Minister, but when will we actually get some facts for once, when will we do some evaluation?"
"There are also a number of questions that I would really like to see answered in relation to Swift, as they were not answered on 3 September."
"Why not?"
"It was known back in 2007 that the architecture of Swift needed to be reformed."
"Why did the Council only come up with this plan at the very last minute in the summer, while Parliament was still to get started?"
"Why have you not consulted the national parliaments on the mandate?"
"Why?"
"Is this not a case of policy laundering, Minister, where it is actually the case that European governments are trying to get access to our data via the US government?"
"Just come out and say it!"
"Finally, let me deal with transparency."
"The documents, and specifically the legal advice from the Council's own Legal Service, must be made public, and not just in a small room only accessible to MEPs - since we have already found them next to the photocopier, we already know what they say - but for the citizens of Europe."
"That is real transparency."
"Mr President, the Presidency and the Commission talk constantly of strengthening civil rights and of a Europe of the citizens."
"In fact, however, fundamental rights are being eroded and proper public debate on them frustrated."
"Every effort is being made to exclude parliaments and hold back information."
"This sort of untransparent approach is unacceptable for a democratic Europe."
"It is not enough to just tap at the door; a responsible parliament must stop this undesirable development."
"The Presidency must interrupt negotiations until it can guarantee the rights of citizens and parliaments."
"The horse-trading which you are planning for banking data, with no binding protection mechanism, will sell the data protection rights of Europe's citizens down the river and create a preventive general suspicion towards all citizens."
"We Greens will have nothing to do with this."
"Not even temporarily and certainly not if we have servers here in Europe and no longer just in the US, because the data will continue to be sent to the US nonetheless and legal protection will not be guaranteed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to speak for the first time in this House on behalf of the millions of Europeans who want a different Europe."
"The SWIFT affair is symptomatic of the security blunders imposed in the name of terrorism, where utter contempt is shown for the most fundamental rights of our fellow citizens."
"In this affair, the United States plundered bank data, without legal basis and without even the slightest information from the authorities in Europe."
"The scandal has made the European authorities sit up and take notice."
"An agreement has been signed with the US Government."
"An expert has made an assessment of this agreement."
"Which expert, though?"
"A French anti-terror judge, Judge Bruguière, whose errors in the area of fundamental rights are well known in France."
"We are therefore sceptical about the quality of his report."
"Apart from the matter of principle, the proposal for a resolution put before us includes numerous warnings that we agree with, but they are insufficient."
"We propose amendments to reinforce the demands that the European Parliament has a duty to make."
"We must go further and call for the suspension of the agreement if the principles set out are infringed."
"We would like to know why it has taken the European authorities so long to inform Parliament and why there has been such a rush to conclude this new agreement."
"We are counting on the Swedish Presidency."
"We will continually monitor respect for human rights."
"Yes, our fellow citizens have a right to security, but this must be done without us being forced to live in a big brother society where everyone knows everything about us."
"Mr President, thank you for these important points of view."
"I will try to answer some of the questions in the short time available."
"The first question that arises is, of course, how we can guarantee that the US will abide by the agreement."
"I would like to say that first we have the Bruguière report, which provides a good description of compliance with the terms of what has been agreed to date."
"Secondly, the draft agreement mentions an appraisal body, which I described to you, and also the Presidency, the Commission and representatives of national data protection authorities, the involvement of which is intended to check that the matter is dealt with correctly."
"Obviously, it is crucial that the information is reliable."
"It is also important that everyone realises that when information is transferred in this data programme, it is not the case that people can go in at any time and look at whatever they like."
"There has to be a suspected terrorist crime or the financing of such in order to gain access to this information."
"Naturally, this restricts how the information can be used."
"As regards the criticism as to why this is being brought up now, during the summer, I would point out that the Presidency has asked more or less the same questions as the Members of the European Parliament are asking."
"We were tasked with preparing the matter thoroughly and analysing - among other things - this report, which answers some questions, but also with other matters."
"The reality is that it was not us that decided that SWIFT was to be moved to Europe; this is happening on the basis of other decisions."
"However, the US is keen to be able to use this tool in its fight against terrorism and we also think the equivalent information would be useful to us."
"In order for this to happen, we need an agreement."
"Since the Treaty of Lisbon has not entered into force, we felt it was necessary to provide a temporary solution."
"That is what we are negotiating and that is what we have been mandated by the Council to do."
"That is what I have attempted to describe."
"Neither is it the case that the Presidency wishes to unnecessarily restrict insight or debate in any respect."
"Firstly, this is a public debate after all, and secondly, we are, of course, happy to talk about how the discussions are going."
"However, during negotiations, it is not possible to provide continual access to documents since the very nature of negotiations is that things get changed and then changed again."
"However, I have tried to describe our starting point and the clear mandate that we have from the Council."
"In this, we are very determined to combine a high level of effectiveness and practical use with the stringent requirements of legal certainty and respect for civil liberties and human rights."
"I am entirely convinced that we will achieve this."
"If - contrary to expectation - we do not, then there will be no agreement."
"Mr President, I would simply like to confirm the remarks made by the Minister, who, incidentally, has drawn a very clear conclusion: if we did not really have the data protection assurances we need, for the lasting agreement that the Presidency will have to negotiate and for which the Commission will lend its support, there would not be an agreement."
"That being the case, I believe that we should be able to reconcile matters and so conduct a campaign against terrorism, with respect shown, of course, for the great values and the great principles which mean that we in Europe attach much importance to the protection of privacy, on the one hand, and to the prevention of all commercial espionage, on the other."
"I would simply say that, as far as I am concerned, since taking up my duties, I have obviously noted the fact that the Council asked Judge Bruguière to go and carry out this fact-finding mission in the United States."
"The Bruguière Report, which dates from December 2008, was handed to me in January 2009."
"This report was presented to the European Parliament and the JHA Council in February 2009."
"It was at that point that the Commission felt that it had in its hands the essential elements to ensure the continuity of the TFTP in anticipation of a time when, with the Treaty of Lisbon signed and the Parliament a co-legislator, we can really negotiate a long-term agreement with all the guarantees that the Minister mentioned and all the demands for reciprocity that Mr Strasser, in particular, touched on as well."
"I believe that in this matter, the Council has just made its will very clear."
"The Commission shares this opinion, this firm and clear commitment by the Council to make sure that the European Parliament does indeed become a co-legislator, when the time is right for a lasting agreement."
"Mr President, I have a small point of order."
"I note that once again we are not getting replies from the Council to the questions that we put."
"I asked why the Council waited for two years, until the very last moment, to decide on this deal, and I would also like to know - and we can get the answer in writing - why the national parliaments have been completely excluded from the whole procedure."
"Finally, I read your answer, which was fairly vague and seemed to be saying that you will not publish the legal opinion of the Legal Service of the Council."
"The debate is closed."

"EU strategy for the Baltic Sea area (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea area."
"Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to present one of the main priorities of the Swedish Presidency - the development of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area."
