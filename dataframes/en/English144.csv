"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8))"
"Mr President, why does the honourable gentleman not understand that this measure is designed to improve the fuel efficiency of light commercial vehicles?"
"That means reducing the costs of driving them, mile by mile, at a time when fuel prices are at a record high."
"This helps businesses, not hinders them."
"Mr President, again, this place shows absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in the real world."
"People are struggling out there, and what this legislation does - and it has been made quite clear to us - is put up the cost of small vans which are driven by many small businessmen across the continent."
"It will put it up by at least EUR 5 000."
"That is totally and utterly wrong, and it is something that we can ill afford in a time of recession."
"Mr President, as I hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change, I am struck by two things."
"The first is how no one talks about global warming anymore."
"Even the most out-of-touch MEPs have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public, rightly, very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears."
"The second is the car park beneath us - Porches, Mercedes, BMWs, SUVs, a showroom of gas-guzzling luxury from the people who tut-tut in disapproval at many white vans and plot to make working lives even harder with speed limiters and financial penalties, all for a dogma based on discredited statistics pedalled by a clique of bought and paid-for academics, funded and hyped by super-rich vested interests in the green industrial complex - Al Gore, Prince Charles, Shell and Goldman Sachs - all of whom stand to steal a fortune from the taxes harvested through wind factory subsidies and carbon trading."
"While I appreciate the efforts of some MEPs to blunt the worst excesses of this CO2 hysteria, the plain truth is that anyone who even gives credence to the threadbare hoax of man-made global warming is a collaborator with the deadliest scam in history."
"Yes, deadly, because it is not only robbing ordinary people and de-industrialising the West; it is also right now starving to death hundreds of thousands of the world's poorest children as food crops are replaced by taxpayer-subsidised biofuels."
"But it is boosting profits for Monsanto and giving MEPs all expenses paid trips to palm oil plantations in Malaysia, so that is all right is it not?"
"No, it is not, particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis - not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation."
"Every day wasted talking about limiting emissions of nature's most important fertiliser is a day lost in the struggle to sustain more and more people on less and less energy."
"If it was not such a tragedy, it would be a farce."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, Mr Griffin was wrong when he said that this has been a cold winter across the globe."
"It was actually just some parts of northern Europe and some central parts of the USA."
"Globally, 2010 was one of the two hottest years in recorded history."
"The fact that it is colder here now is also quite predictable, because if the Gulf Stream is pressed down by meltwater from the Arctic, this is an explainable effect."
"So no, 2010 was a very hot year, climate change is real and the measures we are taking are good for the economy."
"Mr President, I do not know if the House noticed, but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years, so it is not just a few places."
"Just as it was two years ago in Copenhagen, when the climate change conference was there, it was the coldest at the climate change conference in Cancún that it had been for decades."
"Secondly, there is no evidence whatsoever of meltwater from the Arctic impeding the Gulf Stream."
"There has been no change in that whatsoever."
"Thirdly, your arguments would be more effective if the climate change computer models had foreseen this a couple of years ago."
"They did not."
"A couple of years ago, we were told that our children would not know what snow was."
"What an absolute nonsense this has been."
"Finally, as for the statistics showing a global warming trend, the key factor everyone is ignoring here is that 65% of the world's weather stations are within 10 metres of an artificial heat source."
"They are virtually all in cities."
"The collapse of the Soviet Union meant that most of the weather stations in naturally cold areas were closed down."
"That is what has skewed the statistics, which are fundamentally bogus because people, boosted by the United Nations, set about finding man-made global warming in order to impose the solutions they wanted."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on securing this agreement."
"It was a difficult agreement to reach, as our debates have clearly shown."
"I think everyone will agree with what has been said."
"Yes, of course, climate change exists, but commercial vehicles are not vehicles that people buy for the sheer pleasure of driving or because they are passionate about them."
"They are vehicles that people use as a tool for their work, which means that the target of 147 grams of CO2 by 2020 strikes the right balance."
"I would have even preferred slightly more, but at least this is a proposal that seems to me to be more balanced than the one initially put forward by the Commission."
"That proposal would have resulted in technological targets being imposed on manufacturers, with the associated innovation costs having a major financial impact on end consumers, who we do not want to penalise, given that they are going through an exceptional period of crisis."
"Nevertheless, I embrace the introduction of incentives for manufacturing high-efficiency vehicles and of penalties for car manufacturers that do not meet the targets."
"Therefore, all this is really a step in the right direction."
"I am also glad to see that there are penalties."
"I am pleased that we have been able to find common ground regarding penalties which are the same as those applied to passenger vehicles."
"For these reasons, I will be delighted to vote in favour of this report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition towards a low carbon economy and the achievement of the objectives set out in the climate change package mean that we need to establish rules to regulate CO2 emissions in various sectors, including the automotive sector."
"I am very pleased with the negotiations, which led to an agreement with the Council to limit emissions to 147g CO2/km by 2020."
"This is a realistic limit that also represents an excellent balance between environmental, social and industrial rules."
"I hope I also played my part in this as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"The agreement reached takes account of the economic crisis that the sector is experiencing and also makes reasonable allowances for the difference between the passenger car sector and the light commercial vehicles sector."
"Just as we saw with the regulation on passenger cars, the European automotive sector will also manage to develop green, competitive and environmentally beneficial technology for light commercial vehicles."
"I hope it will also manage to take advantage of the environmental challenge to invest even more in innovation and research."
"Mr President, maybe we should question whether or not we might have achieved more if this measure had been introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial vehicles rather than to reduce CO2."
"In practice, of course, it is the same, but one is seen as a cost to business, and the other as a saving."
"Mr Nuttall says that this measure will increase the price of vehicles by EUR 5 000."
"I suspect it will not increase it by a single euro."
"Let us have this debate in three years' time and see who is right."
"The fact is that oil prices are now at USD 100 a barrel."
"That is more than the Commission estimated when it undertook its assessments."
"The potential savings to business are greater, and I wish the EPP would recognise this."
"The EPP has been talking on behalf of big business, of the manufacturers, instead of on behalf of all the businesses which use light commercial vehicles and which need more fuel-efficient technology to drive down costs."
"The manufacturers have made great technological progress over recent years."
"We should be driving forward that ambition."
"I hope that the Commission will come back in its review in a couple of years' time and ensure that this ambition has a chance to be properly realised."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, does the right honourable gentleman really think that it is correct to vote for legislation that will, in effect, push up the cost of vehicles?"
"He knows it will, and I know it will."
"In effect, what it will be doing is putting small firms in Liverpool and Manchester - in his own constituency - out of business."
"Does he think that is fair?"
"Does he think it is morally correct?"
"Is he prepared to stand on that platform in the elections in three years' time?"
"Mr President, the UK Government, in the form of the Department for Transport, actually undertook an assessment of the effects of this measure."
"It found they were likely to be more beneficial to businesses than even the Commission had estimated."
"The net savings on running a vehicle, when fuel prices are at record highs, are greater than any potential increase in the cost of the vehicles - net savings for businesses and lower prices for consumers."
"This is what the UK Independence Party is so determined to fight against."
"In doing so, it wants businesses to pay more than they need."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal initially set a long-term emissions limit of 135g CO2/km for light commercial vehicles, to be achieved by 2020."
"However, in the unanimous opinion of manufacturers, it was technically impossible to respect this limit."
"If the report had been approved as it was, the level of CO2 would have been reduced by 0.00014% at a global level, compared to an extremely high economic impact of more than EUR 45 billion for Europe alone, which would inevitably lead to an average price hike of around EUR 3 800 per vehicle."
"Despite these problematic issues, an agreement was reached with the Council at first reading that sets the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020 at 147g CO2/km, subject to feasibility, which must be assessed by the Commission before January 2013."
"In any case, this decision is purely political and has absolutely nothing to do with real industrial or market conditions, or consumer interests."
"We will be voting against the report, because we believe that the economic impact is excessive in relation to the insignificant reduction of CO2 at a global level."
"(ES) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, who has worked very hard and, most importantly, achieved an optimum result."
"It was not at all easy to reach an agreement at first reading on a regulation as complex as this one."
"The motor industry is of vital importance in the European Union."
"It is, moreover, an industry that is committed to the European Union's objective of reducing emissions and to technological innovation."
"This agreement is a stable framework that gives legal certainty to our vehicle manufacturers."
"I believe that the targets for reducing emissions are both ambitious and realistic."
"Manufacturers will have to achieve 147 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2020."
"I am sure that they are going to succeed, and they will therefore have contributed to the European Union's objective of reducing emissions by 20% by that year."
"However, there are also other elements of interest in this new regulation, such as super-credits and promoting alternative fuels."
"Biofuels are clearly promoted, in line with the EU's objectives regarding renewable fuels for 2020."
"I am highlighting this obvious fact because if the Commission continues with its hesitant proposals on biofuels, we will not achieve our objective for 2020."
"Finally, I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, the shadow rapporteurs and everyone else involved in the work on this directive."
"We will now finally also have a regulatory instrument for emissions from light commercial vehicles, and that is important."
"The directive now needs to be introduced as quickly as possible."
"At the same time, we did not go as far as many of us would have liked, and I think we should talk openly and honestly about that."
"What we are seeing is an environmental and industrial policy decision that has clearly been influenced by the economic crisis and by the fact that so many European governments, conservative, right-leaning governments, have chosen to respond to this economic crisis by simply making cuts and not making any investments."
"The result of this is high unemployment and low demand, and it is affecting both the passenger car industry and the light commercial vehicle industry."
"Of course, this could be called realism, but what it amounts to is enforced adaptation to the economic crisis and a policy of cuts."
"The Commission was therefore more ambitious even than Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and that is unusual."
"I am grateful for the fact that this decision nevertheless contains a review of the emissions targets for 2014."
"I therefore hope that we will get another chance to show that we mean business when it comes to not allowing competitiveness and lofty ambitions on climate policy to conflict with each other, but instead enabling these two factors to drive each other forward."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, it is with reluctance that I will vote for the final compromise."
"The negotiations were dreadful, and to my mind, this vote is a decision imposed as a result of the power play within Parliament and the Council."
"The major producing countries, supported by a majority of MEPs who are sensitive to the industry's arguments, have succeeded in preventing us from setting an ambitious emissions reduction target."
"I would point out that the Commission had suggested a target of 135 grams per kilometre by 2020."
"Parliament is therefore being less ambitious than the Commission, and that is regrettable."
"The automotive industry, which fought against this text - and we have just had some more examples of this - has evidently not realised that it has everything to gain from pioneering a reduction in emissions, especially since the study by the European Federation for Transport and Environment carried out last November showed that technological solutions do exist."
"The study notes that car manufacturers in Europe reduced CO2 emissions for non-commercial vehicles by 2-10% in 2009, and that one Japanese manufacturer has all but reached its target six years early."
"I will vote for this compromise because we run the risk of destroying this achievement, as small as it may be, with a second reading."
"However, I would stress that we are not doing manufacturers any favours by defending the status quo and that, as far as the public authorities are concerned, by failing to encourage innovation, they are not fulfilling their role."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outcome we have arrived at is extremely ambitious."
"I should like to note that CO2 emissions from these vehicles are currently around 200 g per square kilometre."
"Reducing this to 147 g therefore cuts this threshold by more than 25%."
"Furthermore, I would emphasise that marginal reductions are the most costly, so we should be careful."
"I also think that this particular category of vehicles cannot be compared to passenger cars, as has often been the case in this House."
"The cycles of production are much longer and it would have a mere 1.5% effect on CO2 emissions across the whole transport sector."
"If we do not establish our central aim, we will end up penalising a sector that has already suffered an abrupt contraction of more than 30%, above all, hurting small and medium-sized enterprises, which, just 12 hours ago, all of us in this House confirmed we wanted to support due to the huge economic and social role they play as the only true engine of employment in Europe."
"We must therefore be very careful."
"I applaud the work that has been done, but we do need to exercise careful supervision."
"(NL) Mr President, the text before us is, indeed, a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there, particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties."
"On the other hand, it is important that emission standards are established for this category of vehicles - something which seems to have slipped through the net a bit, seeing as a number of rules already exist for both passenger cars and goods vehicles."
"The trend is heading in the right direction, but - as you have said yourself - the number of LCVs has increased enormously in recent years and it looks as if that number will continue to rise in years to come."
"As a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to return briefly to speed limits."
"We in the Committee have proposed that the speed limit be set at 120 kilometres per hour from 2018, which is really not unreasonable."
"As you know, there is already a limit for goods vehicles, and I think that, for both environmental and road safety reasons, it would be advisable to lay this down in law."
"It seems to me that you have to do that at European level, because there is little sense in leaving this to Member States."
"Consequently, Commissioner, I would like to invite you to revisit this issue, together with your colleague, Mr Kallas - he is here in the Chamber with us - study it and put forward a proposal."
"I think that this would be a positive thing for your respective areas of responsibility: the environment and road safety."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, ladies and gentlemen, we are not here today to hold a discussion on the climate."
"Instead, we simply need to do what is possible."
"I welcome the compromise that has been reached."
"By restricting emissions to 147 grams per kilometre from 2020, we are setting very clear standards."
"This will create incentives for the development of new technologies to increase energy efficiency and combat climate change."
"The users of the vehicles will also benefit from these innovations, which will save them fuel and therefore money."
"Small vans are primarily used by tradespeople, small and medium-sized companies, farmers and winegrowers."
"They generally only travel short distances and are often driven for many years until the company is passed on to the next owner."
"Therefore, the costs of these vehicles must remain manageable."
"Higher investment costs must be funded on the basis of energy efficiency and energy savings."
"The long-term goal of 2020 leaves enough time for transition periods so that research organisations and the industry can develop and manufacture new engines."
"The target which we have set for ourselves is realistic, achievable and still efficient."
"I hope that it will receive broad support."
"(PL) Mr President, everyone involved in road transport, both manufacturers of passenger vehicles and manufacturers of light commercial vehicles, should contribute to limiting overall CO2 emissions."
"I therefore welcome the compromise worked out by the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission, which sets limits on emissions and penalties for non-compliance with these limits."
"Setting mandatory and ambitious limits which are also realistic will pose a challenge to the innovative potential of the European automotive industry."
"It will act as an incentive to step up research and development efforts aimed at finding new design solutions which can be used to manufacture vehicles which are more environmentally friendly."
"We must have our own green technologies so that we can avoid importing vehicles, as has been the case with hybrid technology."
"I believe that the legislative decisions we have taken will act as an appropriate stimulus to mobilise European manufacturers, who will realise that green technologies represent an opportunity for development."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his position, and I note that Parliament finds itself in a tight corner between a Commission that is very ambitious and a Council that is, as usual, cautious, between climate sceptics and climate critics, and between industry supporters and environmentalists."
"This is therefore a balanced position that remains ambitious, since the target of 147 grams in 2020 will give industry the time to make the technological leap while simultaneously encouraging it to be highly efficient."
"The extension of the amendment period until 2018 is positive and will make research into, and the production of, non-polluting vehicles more attractive."
"I would like to make two comments by way of conclusion."
"Naturally, I welcome the fact that the proposal has been passed at first reading, and I did not fully understand the comments by our fellow Member just now, when he said that he preferred second readings."
"Secondly, like Mr El Khadraoui, I deplore the absence of speed limitation devices, as it means that we will continue to be overtaken on motorways by the only vehicles that no longer keep to the speed limit, namely, light commercial vehicles."
"(RO) Mr President, this regulation marks a step forward in terms of gradually achieving the CO2 emission reduction targets for light commercial vehicles in Europe."
"This will be possible to achieve by creating incentive schemes for making vehicles more efficient and by imposing penalties on manufacturers who do not meet these targets."
"However, I do not think that the new legislation on CO2 reduction should jeopardise the position of either car manufacturers or the customer."
"The new regulations must pay heed to the concerns of SMEs and European car manufacturers, which are asking for the gradual introduction of the pollution limits to start after 2015, as the vehicles which will be sold in 2014 are already at the development and production stage."
"The figure of 147 grams is an acceptable compromise compared to the figures which have been mentioned."
"However, the Commission must monitor closely relations between the car industry and users to assess this measure's impact on prices and, by extension, on the activity of small enterprises."
"(PL) Mr President, the manufacture of light commercial vehicles and related technological issues require much greater investment and a longer-term strategic plan and manufacturing cycle than is the case for passenger vehicles."
"Approval of such a long-term goal was essential in this respect in order to provide industry with guaranteed security of manufacturing."
"On the other hand, we should not neglect the target limit of 147 g to be achieved by 2020."
"The initial short-term goal which has been set of a limit of 175 g, with a view to achieving the goal of 147 g by 2020, will significantly increase the cost of manufacturing light commercial vehicles, making them more expensive for many small companies which use them as tools for their daily work."
"I hope that this will not result in a marked drop in sales of new vehicles, which, in turn, would mean that technologically older vehicles which are responsible for much higher levels of emissions would stay on the roads longer."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise reached with the Council certainly seems more balanced and realistic compared with the initial proposal of the Commission, which was so ambitious that it appeared utopian in parts, as it did not take industrial conditions and the impact on the market into due consideration."
"Overly ideological environmentalism always runs the risk of making tangible results less likely, resulting in harm being done to the environment."
"In my opinion, despite the fact that the long-term objective of 147g CO2/km by 2020 is not yet optimal, it could turn out to be more reasonable and realistic than what was originally proposed."
"I also welcome the planned incentives for eco-innovations but, in my opinion, a critical issue remains: the decision on emissions from so-called completed vehicles, meaning those built in a number of stages."
"I hope the Commission respects its commitment to submit a specific legislative proposal on this before the end of this year."
"(RO) Mr President, I welcome the fine job which the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, and my colleague, Mr Groote, have done in completing this report."
"This regulation will force car manufacturers to develop new green technologies and, although this seemingly imposes a new burden on them, it may boost the car industry's competitiveness on the global market."
"At the same time, it will help meet CO2 emission reduction commitments, in line with the European Union's strategy."
"The compromise amendments which have been agreed provide sufficient time for manufacturers to prepare the implementation of new technologies, as well as for the Commission to develop an effective mechanism for monitoring breaches of the provisions in this area."
"(PT) Mr President, the management of innovation, in other words, the research and development of new technologies and production processes, their implementation on a large scale and the choice of the appropriate time to implement them, should have the protection of the public interest, improvement of quality of life for the public and environmental protection, first and foremost, as its guiding criteria."
"These principles, rather than the narrow commercial interests of industry and business, should primarily guide the efforts towards innovation and the management of their implementation."
"This also applies to the case of vehicle emissions."
"Given that the transport sector accounts for a substantial proportion of CO2 emissions, an appropriate part of the efforts at reduction should be focused on this area."
"It is therefore important to pursue an increase in vehicle energy efficiency, a reduction in fuel consumption and, in general, the development of low carbon technologies."
"This is now made possible by scientific and technical developments, which take into account the progressive and inexorable scarcity of fossil fuels at the very outset, something that it is already vital to heed."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I will be brief."
"I am going to vote for this text because I believe that this compromise is a step in the right direction."
"At the same time, however, I regret that it has not gone as far as the proposal made by Mrs Hedegaard."
"Therefore, I would now like you to tell us, following the debate and before the vote in a few hours' time, what the procedure you are going to adopt for the next two years consists of, since a review is due to take place in 2013, thus allowing us without delay, as our group rapporteur Mr Groote wanted, to take this fight further in order to reduce pollution by these light commercial vehicles."
"That is my question to you, Commissioner, and I know that you will be tenacious so that we can make progress in spite of this industrial lobbying, which I, like a number of my fellow Members who have spoken on this matter, consider inappropriate."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Hedegaard, I cannot conceal the fact that I am one of those people who would much rather have adopted a target of 135 grams today."
"However, I believe that this compromise reflects reality and shows that we are prepared to make a serious joint effort to limit and reduce CO2 emissions."
"The European Union has recently succeeded in reducing overall CO2 emissions by 9%."
"However, emissions in the transport sector have increased by almost 30%."
"Purely from this perspective, I believe that the move we are making today is another step in the right direction."
"However, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted from the fact that the real problems in the transport sector lie elsewhere, given the overall increase of 29%."
"In other words, we need to focus heavily on developing public transport."
"We must not increase the burdens on small and medium-sized companies."
"Instead, we must make things easier for commuters and speed up the construction of railways."
"We will achieve much more by moving from individual transport to public transport."
"I think we are taking the first step in the right direction because, after all, we are talking about a reduction of 25%."
"(NL) Mr President, I wish to congratulate everyone, but I would have liked to have seen a more ambitious result."
"Much more ambitious."
"And why?"
"I will give you five reasons: more innovation, greater competitiveness for Europe, the environment, obviously, because this could have saved us raw materials, and it would have been cheaper for the consumer, too."
"We in Europe are very dependent on imports of raw materials for energy."
"With cleaner technology, we would have made many more savings and we would also have given an enormous impetus to our strong automotive industry to come up with clean, intelligent technology which could be sold anywhere in the rest of the world and which could have given us a headstart."
"This would have been cheaper and more efficient, precisely because we are so dependent on imports."
"It would also have translated into savings for the consumer."
"The purchase price might have been higher, but it would ultimately have worked out cheaper per kilometre."
"That would have been very much of interest to small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular."
"For the Dutch, the saying 'Look after the cents and the euros will look after themselves' is still very interesting!"
"(ES) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs, and especially our shadow rapporteur, Mr Groote, for a proposal that will encourage our industry to become greener."
"However, I find it deeply regrettable that we have lost a golden opportunity to introduce speed limiters, which are essential tools for helping improve air quality."
"I must point out that the directive has already been compulsory for more than a month and a half, as demonstrated in cities such as Barcelona, where the socialist council has set the speed limit at 80 km per hour, and the difference has been felt compared with other cities such as Madrid or Valencia that have conservative councils, where the population is at high risk of suffering from allergies and respiratory diseases."
"Speed limiters would have helped us to reduce these problems, and also to improve road safety and cut the number of human lives lost."
"It is therefore regrettable, and we trust that we will be able to achieve this in future legislation."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first, a brief remark to Mr Pargneaux who asked what the plan was for the next few years."
"First, of course, as we have agreed, the Commission must assess the progress made and ascertain whether things are feasible."
"That is what we have all agreed, but, of course, we have reason to believe that it is feasible because our impact assessment has already demonstrated this."
"We are aware of the cost and consequences of whatever we do, and the level we choose to impose."
"So we believe that it will be feasible but we are, of course, looking into this."
"I would just like to say that reopening the debate as to the 2020 target could lead to uncertainty in planning, so, of course, we should now stress that a long-term target has been set."
"Many manufacturers appreciate that because that gives them the long-term planning that they really need, the predictability that they need."
"In the end, they appreciate that."
"That was also an answer to Mr Vlasák and his concerns."
"Just a brief remark to Mr Nuttall - I do not know if he is still here - or rather to Mr Nuttall's father, because he has absolutely nothing to worry about, except that his son is using figures from a source I am not familiar with."
"The fact is that the cost of doing this is much less than Mr Nuttall claimed and the money saved in fuel consumption is greater than the cost."
"So, in the end, Mr Nuttall's father will not only save money, but will have a net gain."
"He can also explain that his children and his grandchildren will have cleaner air."
"At the same time, what we are trying to do here is to boost innovation in a very important industrial sector for Europe."
"This is what we are trying to do."
"Wrapping up this debate, I would just say that we have the benefit of the wide-ranging experience we have gained in the field of car legislation."
"In every case, it turned out that the manufacturers could comply with legislation faster and with less expenditure than they had claimed."
"I would not be surprised if the same thing happens with vans."
"So regulation for cars is in place."
"Now it is the turn of vans."
"I appreciate the very broad support for this piece of legislation."
"The next thing we have to look into in this field will be heavy-duty vehicles and there, of course, I greatly look forward to working in cooperation with the European Parliament."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, let me respond briefly to many of the points that have been made."
"Mr Schlyter said he thought it was bad for European industry and it would result in more light commercial vehicles being built in Asia."
"I have to say that I simply do not understand that remark."
"We are setting the most challenging targets in the world by far, much tighter than the rules in the States or anything that exists in China or the Far East."
"Mrs Wils compared this regulation with the passenger car regulation."
"In my view, that is a false comparison."
"The opportunities to reduce emissions in passenger cars are much greater in terms of lightweighting and changing the fuel mix."
"There is already a much higher diesel penetration in the vans market."
"Of course, by their nature, vans are already much more utilitarian and are bought by business customers."
"Mr Nuttall, I am afraid, has not stayed for the end of this debate, but he is wrong in the figures that he has given."
"This will result in overall cost savings for many businesses."
"I have to say that I would have a little more respect for the remarks that he made if indeed the EFD Group had bothered to send a single representative to any of our trialogue meetings or to any of our shadow meetings to make the point that they are fond of quoting on behalf of small businesses."
"(Applause)"
"In conclusion, I think this is a good result."
"It produces the best balance, first of all, in favour of costs for businesses, but also in terms of environmental improvement."
"Whatever view you take of climate change, fuel efficiency - using precious resources more efficiently - has to be a good thing."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday today (15 February 2011)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - The agreement which has been reached with Council is the result of tough negotiations in the face of intense lobbying from industry."
"Throughout the whole process, we have resisted heavy pressure from manufacturers to weaken the regulation and, in particular, to reduce the ambition of the long-term CO2 reduction targets."
"It was a difficult dilemma, as many of us have car industries which are already struggling because of the economic context."
"But we knew from our experience with the passenger cars regulation that the car industry has made enormous progress in terms of innovation and developing cleaner technology because the legislative framework encouraged them in the right direction."
"We wanted to repeat this success with legislation for vans - not just for environmental reasons, but because greater fuel efficiency will ultimately bring costs down for many businesses."
"We have a compromise text which, although not as ambitious as we would have liked, will lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from vans and contribute to the EU's emission reduction ambitions for 2020 and beyond."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadows on their successful negotiations with the Council."
"The road transport sector is the second highest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, and its emissions have not stopped increasing."
"All types of vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, should therefore be covered by regulations aimed at reducing these emissions."
"The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions will be better achieved if there is legislation covering the whole EU, rather than national legislation with different objectives."
"That said, we need to combine ambition with realism and good sense."
"Therefore, and given that small and medium-sized enterprises are most likely to use light commercial vehicles, and that these make up 99.8% of companies and 67.4% of jobs within the EU, we should not pursue goals that might jeopardise them."
"I therefore agree with the target of 147 g of CO2 emissions per kilometre for new light commercial vehicles in the EU, if it is confirmed that this option is viable."
"I also welcome the fact that a single speed limit for this type of vehicle has not been introduced at EU level."
"I welcome this measure, as it is very important that a balance be maintained between protecting the environment and protecting jobs and the competitiveness of SMEs in the EU."
"Rights of passengers in bus and coach transport (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Antonio Cancian, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 (00063/2010 - -."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiation that I led by myself for the first year and then, during conciliation - the first conciliation procedure after the Treaty of Lisbon, I would note - with the guidance of Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and the support of the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson, has been more arduous and difficult than expected."
"Through this regulation, Europe's 70 million bus and coach passengers will also enjoy a range of rights that until now were much reduced or almost non-existent in comparison with other means of transport."
"During negotiations on this important issue with three rotating presidencies, the goals we wanted to fulfil were as follows:"
"a regulation that would protect non-discriminatory access to transport by bus and coach;"
"a regulation that would bear in mind the particular characteristics of the sector, which involves small and medium-sized enterprises which could not have additional and excessive economic burdens imposed upon them;"
"a regulation that would fill a regulatory vacuum that left the bus and coach transport sector in an anomalous position compared with other means of transport and would therefore ensure minimal guarantees for all passengers;"
"a regulation that would protect the rights of persons with reduced mobility as much as possible, given the intransigent attitudes within the Council;"
"a regulation that would bear in mind the needs of an ageing population for whom public transport will be an essential resource in the coming decades."
"The text voted on today is the fruit of a very hard-fought compromise, but one which pleases us given the direction taken in the debate and in the negotiation itself."
"The main problems were primarily encountered in defining the scope of application."
"In fact, the regulation applies to all regular services, whether regional, national or international, over a distance greater than 250 km."
"In any case, we have prepared a list of fundamental rights that cannot be ignored, irrespective of such a distance."
"These rights focus principally on the right to transport, as well as training, information and responsibility."
"At distances of over 250 km, the regulation essentially provides for compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, the rights of passengers in the event of cancellation or delay, and the rights of persons with disabilities or persons with reduced mobility."
"Furthermore, with regard to complaints, the carriers must set up and activate a system for dealing with complaints relating to the rights and obligations referred to in this regulation."
"The time needed to provide a definitive response cannot be more than three months from receipt of the complaint."
"Lastly, each Member State must designate a new body or, better still, an existing body, responsible for enforcing this regulation."
"The Member States will be able to avoid implementing the regulation for a period of four years, which can be renewed once upon prior notification to the Commission of the reasons for this."
"Member States are also asked and urged to develop a future single ticket for each transport type and a single national body responsible for passengers' rights in all means of transport."
"The final text can be deemed a pleasing and balanced compromise."
"The outcome of the conciliation procedure must be seen as a victory for Parliament."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate on the proposal for a regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"This is a very important moment, as our discussions on this legislative act are coming to a close after two years."
"First of all, on behalf of the Council, I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the European Parliament for its cooperation and for the sprit of compromise that allowed us to reach an agreement in the Conciliation Committee to the benefit of EU bus and coach passengers, in particular, as regards disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility."
"The discussions among the three institutions have not been easy, but they were always constructive and guided by a spirit of compromise."
"The joint text on which an agreement was reached at the Conciliation Committee meeting, and which will hopefully be adopted today, represents a compromise across political groups."
"Therefore, I would like to pay tribute to all involved in the work on this legislative proposal and, in particular, to Vice-President Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, Brian Simpson - Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Cancian - the rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their work."
"Together, they have had to bring the legislative process to a successful outcome."
"My thanks also go to Commissioner Kallas and his team and to their counterparts from the secretariats in Parliament and the Council."
"Together, they worked tirelessly in helping to move things forward."
"Last but not least, I would like to express my appreciation for the excellent work of the Belgian Presidency in securing the necessary support within the Council for the compromise reached in the Conciliation Committee."
"I am convinced that the joint text resulting from the Conciliation Committee meeting represents a fair balance between the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and the interests of carriers, most of which are small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the Council's view, the main objective of the regulation is to grant rights to passengers travelling on regular services where the scheduled distance is equal to, or more than, 250 kilometres."
"Furthermore, a guaranteed number of rights will apply independently of the distance travelled."
"The new rules focus, in particular, on helping disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility."
"In the discussions between the three institutions, we were able to find mutually acceptable solutions on a number of difficult issues, namely the scope, the rights of passengers in the event of cancellations or delays, compensation and assistance in the event of accidents, provisions easing the transition to the new rules, and finally, the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"As you already know, the Council approved the joint text at its meeting on 31 January 2011."
"This legislative act will therefore be signed tomorrow."
"Its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union can be expected in March."
"(IT) Mr President, lastly I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work."
"Let me congratulate you on a job well done."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the legislative proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and by coach that we are discussing today is the result of a very difficult process, including conciliation."
"Long negotiations on the night of 30 November 2010 at the Conciliation Committee led to a breakthrough and a compromise after more than two years of negotiations."
"Let me convey my heartfelt thanks to you for making this happen."
"First, to Vice-Chair Madam Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her skilful leadership, to Mr Simpson, Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Cancian, the rapporteur, and, of course, we should also mention the Belgian Presidency."
"I am grateful to Parliament for always having pushed for a high level of passenger protection."
"After the endorsement by the Council on 31 January, I invite you to also adopt this regulation and formally conclude the procedure."
"The proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach now completes the arrangements for the protection of travellers and will ensure that passengers benefit from the same basic standards of service quality wherever they travel in the Union."
"The compromise text contains important achievements: it provides a set of basic rights for all passengers travelling by bus and coach."
"As Mr Cancian has already mentioned, there were difficult points unresolved until the last moment of negotiations."
"Some may say that the scope of the regulation on bus and coach services of 250 km and more is too limited and they would have wished to see passengers in local transport protected too."
"Others may claim that the text contains provisions whose implementation would be costly, in particular, for smaller operators."
"I am of the opinion that the text represents a very well-balanced compromise."
"We should not forget that a number of basic rights apply to services of all kinds and provide special protection to the most vulnerable passengers."
"On the other hand, potential cost implications for the industry have been kept to a minimum."
"All in all, the compromise text constitutes a real advance for travelling citizens and for the image of the industry."
"Mr President, Mrs Győri, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Cancian in particular for his hard work, because this was not a straightforward dossier, but we have reached a good conclusion."
"Compromises obviously always have their advantages and disadvantages."
"Some people will think that we have gone too far and others that we have not gone far enough."
"The process in the Council was not easy and, therefore, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Council for enabling us to reach a compromise at the last minute."
"I think the scope of the report is correct."
"We have said that three countries are not directly affected."
"However, because Luxembourg is involved in a cross-border context, there are actually only two countries which the regulations do not affect directly."
"In the case of local public transport, it will be easy to include provisions in the requirement specifications for tenders which state that passengers' rights must be respected and reinforced."
"Therefore, it is not realistic to criticise us for excluding local transport."
"This can be dealt with at a regional level."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will give its overall support to this compromise."
"We see passengers' rights as a complete package and we hope that it will be possible in the near future to produce a consolidated version covering the whole area, so that we can soon put in place rights which will benefit the citizens rather than the lawyers."
"In my view, there are still a number of problems, particularly with regard to the implementation, where the regulations are not useful to citizens and where they are not clear enough to establish passengers' rights."
"Against this background, I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work."
"I hope that we can achieve a large majority in plenary in support of this healthy compromise."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my thanks, and the thanks of the S&D Group, to Mr Cancian, for his hard work on what was indeed a very difficult and very complicated dossier."
"Two questions spring to mind when you look at this particular agreement."
"The first is, 'Is it ideal?', and the second is, 'Does it move us forward?'."
"In response to the first question, from a parliamentary point of view, I think we have to say that it is not ideal."
"By the very nature of it being a compromise, there are things there that Parliament has had to give up, particularly on the scope, where we would have liked to have seen a smaller distance before the regulation kicks in."
"But does it move us forward?"
"Well, yes it does, because we will now have in place a similar set of rights for buses and coaches to those that we currently have for other modes of transport."
"It also moves us forward in our commitment to improving access to bus and coach travel for those people with reduced mobility, and indeed disabled people, throughout the European Union."
"I would just pick up on one issue, which concerns asking for staff to be trained to help people with reduced mobility and disabilities so that they can have the same access to public transport as those of us who are able-bodied have."
"I know there is a derogation for Member States to push this back for five years in this area, and I hope they will not use that."
"Finally, I think it is important for us to support this final agreement so that the rights for all the modes of transport are now in place."
"I know we will go forward in future to look at them again and revise them again, but I think we have made a step forward in this area and that Parliament should support the agreement that Mr Cancian reached with the Council in conciliation."
"Mr President, a long procedure has now come to an end, which is good news."
"There are some positive aspects to all of this."
"One is that the basic rights for people with disabilities include the right to information and the right to access."
"Another positive feature is that the damages paid by small and medium-sized businesses have been kept to a reasonable level, which was not originally the case."
"It is also good that we have reached an agreement, because otherwise, we would have been stuck in the conciliation procedure and there would have been no regulations at all covering one specific area of transport."
"However, I would also like to pick up on some negative points, as we have not been able to produce a genuine European solution."
"Although we say that the free movement of people, goods and services is a European principle, we have not reached a European solution in this area, if three countries are not included and other countries do not have bus routes of this length."
"The right of people with disabilities to be accompanied, which is something they often need in order to be able to travel, is only guaranteed over long distances."
"In addition, the clause on major natural disasters, which does not apply to air travel, because damages had to be paid in the case of the ash cloud, has been applied to buses and coaches."
"This means that poorer passengers in particular who are making short journeys will not be compensated and have no rights."
"That, of course, is not a good thing."
"Therefore, because of this mix of positive and negative features, we abstained from voting during the midnight session in the conciliation procedure and we will do the same today."
"Mr President, despite the EU being a signatory to the relevant convention, the rights of people with reduced mobility are not taken into consideration in this dossier."
"I have mentioned this at the beginning of my comments on this report, because I think its most serious failing is the fact that we have always included the restriction 'if possible'."
"Unfortunately, I am sufficiently familiar with these situations to be able to say that this 'if possible' generally results in it not being possible to provide an efficient solution for people with reduced mobility."
"I was particularly disappointed when a restriction was placed on the formats used to make information available about bus and coach travel."
"This has also been toned down, so that people with reduced mobility cannot even find out about where they can get assistance and so on."
"There are other problems resulting from the last round of negotiations, which Mr Cancian has really put his heart into, and I would like to thank him for that."
"He has made every effort to produce a good result, but his attempts have been blocked by the Council's hard-hearted approach."
"Another aspect is the distance of 250 kilometres which has already been mentioned."
"I am afraid that longer routes will be divided up and that routes of 500 kilometres will be broken down into two parts, so that there is no risk of having to grant passengers their rights."
"This must be taken into consideration during the implementation process."
"One good feature was the introduction of an arbitration body, which will be helpful for consumers."
"Other positive aspects include the fact that the principle of constant improvement applies and that training will be provided for staff."
"However, in other respects, ladies and gentlemen, this is by no means a masterpiece of European legislation."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to add my thanks to all parties involved in reaching this compromise, but I should especially like to thank Mr Cancian, who, I believe, found absolutely the correct possibilities for compromise on behalf of Parliament."
"With the inclusion of the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach, we have, in principle, now introduced passenger rights in all modes of transport."
"Of course, it could be said that as between different modes of transport, these rights vary greatly, when it comes to levels of compensation, depending on the length of delay or the removal of a route served by that mode of transport."
"Yet, even if our passengers in the European Union may get confused in the initial years, this still represents a step forward in ensuring passenger rights, and the fact that these rights for passengers travelling by bus and coach are the very last to be introduced shows that this was perhaps the most difficult step of all."
"I am particularly pleased about basic rights for the disabled and persons with special needs, and also that these rights apply to them on bus journeys of below 250 km, with the one exception referred to by Mr Simpson, namely, that operators offering these services may defer staff training."
"I very much hope that this will not be done maliciously, just as the Member States may not defer implementation of this directive for four years twice over, until the latest possible date. Thank you."
"Mr President, the rights of passengers in all forms of transport have become an increasingly important topic of debate in the European Parliament in recent years."
"I must say that in many cases, I see problems which may arise from the application of passenger rights, and insuring against these problems will surely be a very lucrative area for many financial institutions."
"On the other hand, fares will logically rise as a result of these new costs."
"It is nothing new that the Council has attempted to change the basic elements of the draft regulation fundamentally with regard to passenger rights in bus and coach transport."
"We are familiar with this position of the Council from previous conciliation proceedings."
"In this context, I would like to thank the Vice President of the delegation, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, and the rapporteur, Antonio Cancian, for a fine piece of work."
"They have achieved what is a genuinely very reasonable compromise."
"I regard the following elements as being particularly positive:"
"1. the definition of long-distance transport as transport where the length of the entire route is in excess of 250 km, with the proviso that the regulation will also apply to people using the long-distance route only as part of their journey;"
"2. improving the position - even if it is not ideal - of people with disabilities and reduced mobility in connection with this mode of transport;"
"3. compensation and assistance in case of an accident."
"I would like to note here that, in the case of damage to equipment such as wheelchairs, compensation of the full amount is envisaged, which entails a level of uncertainty, and it will surely be necessary to clarify the formulation for insurance purposes, for example, through an upper limit;"
"4. the rights of passengers where journeys are disrupted or delayed are relatively clearly set out."
"I also consider the improved information for passengers to be positive;"
"5. like most of my fellow Members, I welcome the fact that the transitional period for implementing this regulation should be reduced to a maximum of four years."
"On the other hand, I am not at all pleased at the possibility of extending this period by a further four years."
"I believe there will be no fundamental problem even in setting out the application of passenger rights on routes parallel with sections of long-distance transport in the near future."
"A question remains as to the setting of financial limits, of course, with the absence of an inflation supplement to adjust the financial limits in accordance with the euro exchange rate, so that the limits remain the same in real terms."
"I believe the agreement is a good compromise."
"The ultimate aim is the further expansion of passenger rights on all forms of transport, and this additional step in bus and coach transport is definitely a successful outcome for the conciliation process."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left supports this outcome."
"Mr President, it is good that following the debate and coordination of positions, the final text can be regarded as a very satisfactory and well balanced compromise."
"It manages to secure the rights of passengers without, at the same time, imposing a heavy burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In particular, the outcome of the conciliation procedure can be regarded as successful for the European Parliament, and I congratulate it on this."
"Taking account of the steady growth of this transport sector, the aim of this proposal is to establish EU-wide rights for the protection of passengers comparable to those in other modes of transport and to secure a level playing field between carriers from different Member States as well as the various modes of transport."
"The regulation strengthens passengers' entitlement to compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, as well as for the loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents."
"Moreover, in the event of an accident, passengers are entitled to assistance to cover their immediate practical needs, including, where necessary, provision of food and clothes, transport, facilitation of first assistance, and accommodation."
"Where travel is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes, passengers shall have the right to compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price, in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price."
"The regulation also strengthens the provision of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, which is very important."
"Passengers must receive updated information in real time by electronic means."
"This is a good decision, congratulations!"
"(DE) Madam President, improving the rights of passengers on regular bus and coach services is a desirable goal."
"However, some points in the proposal go too far."
"For example, passengers are entitled to up to two nights in a hotel if the departure of a regular bus service is delayed by more than 90 minutes."
"However, road transport is often subject to factors which are outside the control of the individual bus operators, such as traffic jams caused by accidents, poor weather conditions and inadequate snow clearance."
"The consequences of this will be costly liability cases where it will not be possible to apply the principle that the party responsible is liable for the damages."
"The most recent EU regulation on rail passengers' rights is in a similar position."
"Companies now have to pay for delays which they have not caused."
"For example, the Austrian federal railway company is liable for the number of hours that trains are delayed, which amounted to a total of 2 800 last year, when they arrive very late from Germany."
"We must avoid inappropriate measures like this in future."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcome the result of the conciliation procedure."
"When the regulation is implemented, bus and coach passengers, including those with reduced mobility, will have the same high level of protection that applies on other forms of transport."
"In addition, the regulation guarantees a high overall level of consumer protection and takes into consideration the fact that this transport sector consists mainly of small and medium-sized companies."
"The extreme requirements which would have made bus transport almost impossible have been removed, together with those that would have excluded the majority of the Member States from the scope of the regulation."
"Bus and coach services which benefit the majority of citizens must also provide a high quality service for disabled people and people with reduced mobility."
"They should have the right to receive help and this must be provided free of charge in the interests of social integration."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to thank Mr Cancian for his efforts in obtaining this difficult compromise."
"Thanks to this regulation, bus and coach passengers can enjoy rights similar to those of passengers on other modes of transport, such as trains and boats."
"The regulation, which applies to all national and international services wherever the distance to be covered is equal to or greater than 250 km, also protects passengers using regular services over shorter distances."
"I am referring, in particular, to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, who have been guaranteed non-discriminatory access to transport, the right to compensation in the event of loss of or damage to wheelchairs, as well as training on disabilities for bus and coach employees."
"I am also delighted that an agreement has been reached on compensation for death, including reasonable funeral expenses, or personal injury, and loss of or damage to luggage due to accidents."
"I also consider it a positive step that passengers can choose between continuing the journey at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price in case of cancellation, a delay of more than two hours, or overbooking."
"In terms of information for passengers, I think it would have been useful to provide them with information on connections with other means of transport, thereby also ensuring dialogue between bus and rail passenger transport services."
"Lastly, I am very pleased that during negotiations, we managed to research and guarantee the maximum level of assistance for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, giving them the option of being accompanied at no extra cost."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Cancian, who has worked very hard to reach this agreement, and following complex negotiations, this document has been agreed upon."
"Progress has been made on passenger rights in terms of compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, cancellation or delay, and in terms of the recognition of basic passenger rights, irrespective of distance; the agreement also includes the rights of disabled people and those with reduced mobility."
"However, the definition of the scope of application, which is journeys longer than 250 km, means that three countries remain outside this European legislation."
"In our view, this is not sufficient, although we acknowledge the progress that has been made compared with what there was initially."
"Our group will therefore abstain."
"(PL) Madam President, today, the European Parliament is sending out a very positive message to passengers, taxpayers and European voters who use buses and coaches, including disabled persons."
"The people who vote for us and pay our wages expect us to take concrete decisions of precisely this kind. There have, of course, been comments in this Chamber to the effect that this is not the most important of matters in the wider scheme of things, and no doubt it is not."
"However, I believe that it is a very significant step forward which will make Europe and the European Union more humane and more open to the needs not of politicians, but of consumers, or, in other words, those who use the various means of transport."
"I would like to thank my neighbour, Mr Cancian, very much for his diligent work as rapporteur."
"(DA) Madam President, bus passengers on long journeys have more or less the same rights as air, train and boat passengers in respect of delays, cancellations, lost luggage and in a large number of other areas."
"This is fine in principle."
"However, I would nevertheless like to raise a couple of points of criticism."
"People with reduced mobility have been granted more rights in this regard here."
"However, not all buses can accept both disabled and able-bodied passengers at the same time, and not all buses can be converted to enable them to carry disabled people."
"Thus, there is still a long way to go in this area if we want to achieve the highest possible level of equality."
"Ticket prices for long journeys are most often kept as low as they can go in order to be able to compete with air traffic."
"I therefore consider it impossible for small bus companies to be able to pay all of the claims for compensation and rights that are being called for here."
"Their ability to be competitive will be severely reduced and they will rapidly come under threat of closure."
"This can hardly be in the interests of the Union, because the EU very much wants to support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to congratulate everyone involved, but in particular, Mr Cancian, for all his efforts during the tough and long-winded process of reaching a compromise on this difficult dossier."
"Some of the successes have already been mentioned, but there were also disappointments, in particular, with regard to the scope and other small points which have been referred to."
"By coming to this compromise on bus and coach transport, we have established passengers' rights on all types of transport."
"The next step which we need to take is to create a common, coherent and efficient framework programme for all passengers' rights."
"It is particularly important for the credibility of the EU among the citizens of Europe that we put in place fair and clearly defined rights."
"In order to be credible, we must ensure that the rights across all the different means of transport are coherent."
"The criteria relating to air passengers' rights must not be fundamentally different from those of rail passengers, for example."
"Therefore, it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest, weakest standards."
"Instead, we must set ourselves ambitious goals on behalf of the citizens of Europe."
"(NL) Madam President, I would, of course, like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his efforts, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Simpson and everybody who has contributed to the result; the Belgian Presidency should not go unmentioned, either."
"However, let me start with a point of criticism, addressed to the Council, in particular."
"I regret the fact that the scope applies only to journeys of 250 km."
"From a European perspective, it would make sense if all cross-border links fell under the provisions of this directive."
"Even when confined to those 250 kilometre journeys, the directive barely received enough support from the Member States to pass."
"Judging not just from this dossier, but also from many other dossiers, it appears that it is becoming increasingly hard to get a majority of Member States to reason in the interests of the consumer or from a European perspective, and I find that very worrying."
"Having said that, this regulation completes the list."
"We now have European rules on passenger rights for all transport modes."
"The next step - and the Commissioner has announced that he will take action on this - must be to learn from the experience gained in the various sectors and to achieve a more integrated approach to passenger rights."
"This should be enforced on the ground, in particular."
"This regulation will mean a step forward, in particular, for people with reduced mobility."
"They will no longer be refused access and will be able to count on assistance, if needed."
"That is important, in my opinion."
"As with other transport modes, compensation has been provided for in a number of cases and there are accommodation arrangements for stranded passengers in the event of lengthy delays."
"For these reasons, we want to support this compromise."
"We are not doing so with a great deal of enthusiasm, because the regulation will not come into force until two years from now."
"However, it is a step in the right direction and it represents a compromise between the Council's extreme position, on the one hand, and our more ambitious targets, on the other."
"(ET) Madam President, Estonians have a proverb: 'Practice makes perfect'."
"Unfortunately, this cannot be said for the directive on coach passengers' rights, which, following a long conciliation procedure, ultimately distanced itself from the principles that had been requested by the European Parliament."
"It is indeed good that we now have minimal fundamental rights, but it is unacceptable that the agreed 250 km route denies these rights in three states."
"In addition, these rights are minimal in three to four other states because there are perhaps only one or two coach routes that long."
"Furthermore, it is not acceptable that cross-border coach services were excluded, irrespective of the distance, and also we cannot support the eight-year period given to Member States where implementation of the said directive is not compulsory."
"Unfortunately, the Estonian Government supported these very conditions, and furthermore demanded a longer route."
"Now we need to ask ourselves whether we are indeed supporting passengers' rights, or those of coach companies and their profits."
"In any case, while I support the citizens of the European Union, I do not understand why part of Europe is excluded from this directive."
"I therefore feel unable to vote in favour of this directive or the report."
"Madam President, I strongly support the principle of passenger rights, and it is only right that customers should expect a high standard of service."
"However, we must have a sense of proportionality and look at what effect this will actually have."
"We have to compare the real benefits for users with the true costs to businesses in this sector."
"This House and the Commission often take a 'one size fits all' approach, but we must accept that passenger rights differ across different modes of transport."
"Air travel is not the same as bus travel."
"Most importantly here, the difference lies with the number of small- and medium-sized businesses in this sector."
"I believe everyone in this Chamber knows the importance of reliable and profitable bus and coach services to our local economies, and it is for this reason that I strongly support the introduction of the 250 km rule."
"It is simply not right that small local companies providing very local or regional services should have these burdens put upon them."
"Given the introduction of that protection, and the value of the underlying principle of this legislation, I strongly support the compromise."
"Madam President, this initiative has been in gestation for almost three years and, for once, I found myself on the side of the Council rather than of Parliament."
"Of course, we need to protect the rights of passengers, and particularly those with disabilities, but the initial proposal - as Philip Bradbourn has said - if adopted, would have serious consequences for small transport providers."
"Indeed, it would put many of them out of business."
"For that reason, the conciliation process was vital and the compromise reached strikes a fair balance between passengers' rights, on the one hand, and those of service providers, on the other."
"I fully agree with Mr Bradbourn that you cannot equate sea passenger rights, air passenger rights, rail passenger rights and bus passenger rights all in the same package."
"For that reason, talking about a consolidated package simply is not something that is feasible and realisable."
"I would like to pay a compliment to the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Brian Simpson, who did an excellent job, to the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, and to our own coordinator, Mathieu Grosch."
"At the end of the day, we have a fair and balanced package which is to the mutual benefit of all concerned."
"(CS) Madam President, in recent years, the European Parliament, together with the Council, has adopted laws relating to passenger rights in air and rail transport."
"It is therefore logical for us now to adopt an analogous measure for bus transport as well, despite the fact that travellers in Europe still prefer individual transport and that standards on bus and coach transport itself are rapidly improving."
"However, our effort and enthusiasm for regulation should have clear boundaries."
"It is logical to define basic standards in the European Union for cross-border travel, protecting vulnerable groups of passengers and securing their rights."
"On the other hand, an effort to extend rights to local transport, and attempts to secure the maximum possible compensation or to regulate down to the last detail, constitute an inappropriate interference in the internal market."
"It is clear that all superfluous obligations mean greater costs for transport operators, which will ultimately be reflected in ticket prices."
"As a former mayor, I therefore followed with concern the proposal to include urban and suburban transport within the scope of the directive."
"I am pleased that common sense has prevailed in this case, and that urban and suburban transport will be protected from excessive regulation."
"(FI) Madam President, I want to thank everyone who has been involved in formulating the compromise and, in particular, the rapporteur and Mr Simpson, Chair of the Committee."
"Although this is a compromise, it is also an important step forward from the perspective of the public."
"If we consider the question of delays and loss of baggage, it is extremely important for the public to know that we have introduced legislation to protect their rights."
"This limited distance of 250 kilometres is not the best possible solution, nor has it succeeded in the way many here have said it has."
"I believe that this is perhaps the weakest point in the act and we will surely have to return to this in the future, but, on the other hand, it is a big step in significantly improving the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"From the point of view of the public, this represents just the sort of legislation that we should be introducing."
"Madam President, this provision is a little like the curate's egg."
"It is good in patches."
"I particularly welcome the dispositions for those with a disability or reduced mobility, but have the same concerns already voiced by other speakers about the 250 kilometre threshold."
"One size does not fit all."
"In the European Union of 27 countries of different sizes, there should have been some flexibility within countries so that all could be included in the provisions."
"I live myself over 300 kilometres from our capital."
"There is a buoyant small business enterprise in coach travel between rural areas in my constituency and the capital, Dublin."
"This now will be put under severe pressure because of the provisions of this proposal and also, particularly, increased insurance costs which may drive them out of business."
"If they go out of business, jobs are lost and the facility for passengers is also lost."
"We will have to monitor this as we go forward."
"(HU) Madam President, I welcome the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"It will be easier for EU citizens, including persons with disabilities, to use this form of service."
"The compromise was preceded by long consultations. During these, the European Parliament and Mr Cancian stood by people with disabilities until the very end."
"Unfortunately, the European Council proved to be more short-sighted and inflexible on this matter."
"I deeply regret that the European Council is unable to recognise that we are living in a rapidly ageing society."
"The number of people with disabilities will skyrocket overnight."
"We should realise that all EU citizens will suffer from this problem, and sooner or later, everyone will require assistance."
"Lastly, I would like to stress that our work is not yet done."
"A compromise has already been reached with regard to four modes of transport, and now it is time to create a single passenger rights charter, which can later facilitate the assertion of passengers' rights."
"(CS) Madam President, the European Parliament is about to vote on an important compromise which will greatly enhance the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"I consider it significant that, besides passenger compensation for loss of or damage to baggage or refunds for late buses and other measures, the compromise also includes enhancing the rights of passengers with disabilities and people with reduced mobility."
"I particularly support the right of disabled people to information and assistance services, at least in line with what was finally agreed in the conciliation process."
"Public transport is a fundamental and important part of the everyday lives of people with reduced mobility."
"It was not easy to reach the compromise, and therefore I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all members of the negotiating team for the work carried out."
"The approval of this regulation will bring into existence a joint protection framework for all types of transport at the European level, and while it is certainly not ideal in the area of passenger rights, it is a very important step forward."
"(FR) Madam President, with the Liberals, I will abstain during today's vote on the regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"This is the last link in the package on the protection of travellers, after air, rail and sea travel, but unfortunately - as has been said - it is much less ambitious."
"This has been said by, among others, Mr Simpson and Mr El Khadraoui, for the Socialist Group; this is exactly what they said."
"As a result, people will have to travel more than 250 km to be protected by this regulation."
"If you travel from Brussels to Amsterdam by air, you are covered; if you travel by coach, you are not."
"And this is all the more unjust, I might add, since those who use this type of transport are often the least well off."
"Neither does the entry into force make any sense, since several derogations could well postpone it until 2011."
"There will be new rights, then, as well as compensation in the event of accidents, delays or cancellations."
"This assistance is vital for disabled people, but the reality is that it will not be introduced straightaway and, more importantly, not everyone will be entitled to it."
"(DE) Madam President, it is a good thing that we now have passengers' rights across all means of transport, but these rights cannot conceal the fact that rail transport, which is environmentally friendly, has once again been put at a severe disadvantage."
"The railway companies pay track access charges for every kilometre travelled, but the same system does not apply to buses and coaches, which benefits bus companies."
"Railways are included in the Emissions Trading System, but buses are not, which again puts buses at an advantage and trains at a disadvantage."
"If a train is delayed, 25% of the fare is repaid in compensation after an hour."
"In the case of buses, it is two hours."
"All these advantages are unacceptable."
"This is why we need an integrated approach."
"We need passengers' rights across all the different means of transport, but we also need fair basic conditions."
"It must not be the case that one passenger only receives compensation after three or five hours, but for another passenger, the period is one hour."
"A great deal remains to be done here and this is not a good compromise in this respect."
"I do not understand why environmentally friendly rail travel is constantly being put at a disadvantage."
"(SK) Madam President, following complex negotiations in the conciliation process, a complex agreement has been reached on the wording of the regulation on passenger rights in bus and coach transport."
"Even though the draft regulation relates only to regular services on routes longer than 250 km, it brings new rules and better protection for bus passengers as well."
"The most important benefit for passengers will perhaps be the definition of their rights in cases of cancelled or delayed services, since it penalises transport operators for organisational failures in transport with an obligation to reimburse up to the entire fare, as well as reimbursing other losses up to the amount of 50% of the fare."
"The only issue which, in my opinion, might have been better handled, is that of the time schedule exemptions, which allow Member States to postpone implementation of the directive by four years, with a subsequent extension of this time period by a further four years."
"A total period of eight years for implementing this directive seems to me overly long."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members for their mostly positive comments."
"We now face the challenge of implementation."
"We face this challenge with all passenger rights legislation."
"Fine-tuning the legislation will, of course, be a long process for us, but I still think that the compromise we have achieved will probably be adopted in a future document and is a great opening."
"It is also a matter of principle that we have introduced certain principles of passenger rights into bus and coach transport, which is such a large area."
"Modest compromises will probably be needed; everything must be fine-tuned and must be implemented, but it is a very important opening and I hope that you will vote in favour of this regulation."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (HU) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Cancian, ladies and gentlemen, I would only like to add two remarks, and comment on the very valuable debate that took place here."
"This debate illustrated very well the difficulties Mr Cancian, as well as we in the Council, the Commissioner and the experts had to overcome."
"I do not believe that this is the best of all possible worlds for travellers using bus and coach transport, but I believe that perhaps the main question we must ask ourselves is whether the situation will improve once the new legislation comes into effect."
"I believe that we can answer this question with a definite yes; that bus and coach passengers will indeed enjoy more rights in the future, even if this is not a perfect compromise."
"A compromise is about having to come to an understanding with each other on difficult issues."
"This was noticeable in almost all speeches, the question of where the boundary is, beyond which we would guarantee rights to such an extent as to cripple important economic actors and small and medium-sized enterprises, whose situation we are trying to keep an eye on."
"At the same time, however, we very much intended to provide additional rights to passengers."
"I can very well understand those who are looking at the issue from the perspective of those with disabilities."
"I believe that we took a significant step forward in this respect as well."
"I feel that this is a well worked-out part of the draft and I trust that the legislation will bring about progress for these people, indeed, especially for these people."
"I would only like to remind the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is thinking in terms of a strong European Union, a European Union which provides additional rights to its citizens and always puts citizens at the centre of these strong policies."
"Furthermore, I am convinced that the current debate on this draft legislation serves to provide citizens in the European Union with additional rights."
"I would once again like to thank everyone for their work, and I trust that today, we will get through the votes without any problems."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as I thank all the fellow Members who have spoken, I, too, should like to express my belief that it is not the best possible regulation but it is the only one that could be obtained given the position of the Council."
"It is a truly important issue since I think it is really crucial for both the transport sector and the tourism sector - two subjects for which the Committee on Tourism and Transport is responsible - to have found a balance for this mode of transport as well."
"It is a balancing act between the need, on the one hand, to protect small and medium-sized enterprises - a topic we have discussed at length over the last few hours - involved in the bus and coach transport sector and, on the other, the need to protect the rights of persons with reduced mobility, disabilities, old-age pensioners, persons with temporary reduced mobility, and vulnerable users overall, in order that there may also be fewer disputes."
"This is the balance we were looking for and, with everyone's contribution, we hope we have achieved it."
"The recast then announced by Mr Kallas is, I believe, founded on the idea of creating a single regulation for all means of transport."
"Indeed, the creation of a single transport market has not yet been accompanied by suitable measures designed to protect passengers' rights."
"Commissioner, aside from the single regulation, I really hope we can bring about the creation of a single reference body, a single ticket office and a single ticket for the various modes of transport."
"I should once again like to thank all the Members who have spoken, those who followed this dossier -particularly the shadow rapporteurs - and those who played an enthusiastic part in the final negotiations."
"My thanks to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the staff of the Secretariat, the Council, particularly the staff of the Belgian Presidency, and, last but not least, Mrs Győri, who is here with us."
"If I may, I should lastly like to thank the European Commission, Mr Kallas and his assistants for the constructive input that they never failed to contribute, the staff of the Secretariat of the European Parliament's Conciliation Committee, which showed great skill and professionalism - indispensable traits when taking important decisions on behalf of our citizens."
"Overall, it has been a good test, which has brought excellent results for Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport aims to establish passenger protection rights, applicable across the entire Union, for all passengers and for various forms of transport."
"The Council did not agree with the European Parliament's amendments, and it was therefore necessary to launch the so-called conciliation procedure."
"The chief points of the agreement that was reached are mainly compatible with Parliament's original proposals."
"It is particularly important that the regulation will apply to all regular domestic and cross-border transport, and Member States will be able to apply exemptions for regular services and some specific services for up to eight years."
"In the event of an accident, passengers will have the right to compensation of up to EUR 220 000 per person and EUR 1 200 for baggage."
"Transport providers must, moreover, provide basic assistance in case of an accident (food, clothing and medical assistance), and lodging for up to two nights."
"In the event of a delay in excess of 120 minutes or the cancellation of a connection, transport providers must offer passengers the option of continuing the journey, rerouting the journey at no additional cost to the passenger or refunding the ticket price."
"If this is not within their power, they must reimburse the ticket price and pay an additional 50% of the ticket price."
"The agreement also protects the rights of people with disabilities and people with limited mobility."
"For the above reasons, I fully support the adoption of the report."
"in writing. - I support this compromise on the rights of bus passengers, guaranteeing a right to transport, a right to accessible travel information, the obligation for bus operators to organise mandatory disability awareness training for drivers, a right to compensation for damaged wheelchairs, a complaint-handling mechanism for all passengers, with independent national bodies to enforce the regulation and issue penalties."
"For all bus and coach journeys of 250 km or more, there will be specific assistance, free of charge, for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, both at terminals and on board and, where necessary, transport free of charge for accompanying persons."
"For blind and partially sighted people in particular, the provisions on accessible travel information and training of drivers in disability awareness would make a huge difference."
"Equal access to transport is essential for independence."
"Without equal access to transport, people with disabilities cannot go to work, go shopping or take part in cultural and other leisure activities."
"While the text does not encompass all that I would want, by supporting it and strengthening the rights of all disabled passengers, I believe that an important step will be taken towards enabling Europe's guide dog users to move across the European Union on an equal footing to other citizens."
"I support the legislative resolution on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004."
"Given the stable growth of this transport sector, I believe that it is essential to establish rights for the protection of passengers which apply throughout the EU, similar to the rights enjoyed by passengers travelling by other means of transport, and also to ensure equal conditions for carriers, no matter which Member State they come from or which means of transport they operate."
"In view of the fact that these rights focus, in particular, on the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, this initiative deserves our support."
"It is of key significance that the resolution establishes compensation rights for passengers who have been injured in coach accidents."
"The provisions mean that passengers will be entitled to compensation in the event of death or injury or loss of, or damage to, luggage caused by an accident."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his work."
"I am pleased that we were ultimately able to reach agreement in the Conciliation Committee."
"Our principal achievement is, of course, the matter of passengers' rights to compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, guarantees for passengers in the event of cancellations and delays, and guaranteed rights for disabled persons and passengers with reduced mobility (PRM)."
"I am particularly pleased by the fact that passengers with reduced mobility have been included in the document, as I mentioned previously, but, at the same time, I have well-founded concerns in this respect: in the case of air passengers, neither the airlines nor the airports know exactly which passengers are to be regarded as passengers with reduced mobility."
"It is common for help to be refused to mothers and father travelling alone with small children as a result of this lack of knowledge among carriers and airports."
"I would therefore like to make the following appeal: our work will not be complete after voting through the document during the plenary session."
"We also have a duty to monitor whether the regulation is properly applied."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work, which has been exceptionally effective."
"Up until now, there has been no guarantee of appropriate protection for passengers travelling by bus and coach, since it was the only form of transport which was not subject to any EU regulations in this respect."
"One of the consequences of the changes which have been made will be that passengers will be able to claim compensation in the event of an accident."
"The fact that assistance for disabled persons will be guaranteed by carriers, and that an accompanying person can travel at the carrier's expense as part of this guarantee, are further extremely significant points."
"I will not hide the fact that it was an exceptional challenge for me personally to be able to play an active role in the conciliation procedure for the first time in history under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"During the negotiations, which lasted until late into the night, together with Mr Cancian, we succeeded in voting through a compromise making the provisions mandatory for distances of over 250 km."
"It should be noted, and this is quite a significant point, that 12 fundamental rights are guaranteed in the regulation, particularly for disabled persons."
"We should currently be placing a great deal of emphasis on an appropriate information campaign to ensure that the citizens of the European Union are aware of the rights to which they are henceforth entitled."
"The legislation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport, which we will be voting on today, might be considered unambitious."
"The compromise reached after much wrangling is, however, better than nothing at all."
"It is regrettable that the proposal for a regulation only applies to national and crossborder bus and coach journeys that are at least 250 km long."
"This being the case, Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus, for example, will not be affected at all."
"It is also unfortunate that the legislation will only enter into force years from now."
"Four, or possibly even eight years, is a long time to wait at bus stops for new legislation."
"There is, of course, something good to be found in the compromise achieved."
"In the original Council position, there were only three basic rights for passengers regardless of distance."
"I am pleased that there are 12 in the final compromise, and that special attention is being paid to the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"The entry into force of the regulation will make it easier for the disabled to travel on buses and coaches."
"At the same time, it puts them on a more equal footing with other passengers."
"When the new legislation enters into force, the Member States must ensure that the regulations are implemented effectively and appropriately. This is in the interests not only of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility but also of our other citizens that travel by bus or coach."
"The regulation voted on today marks a highly significant success as it is the first time that the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach will be protected by law."
"After two years of difficult negotiations, the European Parliament and Member States have reached agreement on the key points which will consolidate the rights of passengers using this means of transport."
"These include compensation in the event of the journey being delayed or cancelled, compensation for loss of, or damage to, luggage, as well as the assumption of liability by companies and the provision of assistance in the event of accidents."
"Non-discrimination against and the provision of assistance to persons with disabilities and reduced mobility, as well as the right of passengers to be informed before and after their journey, have been incorporated into the regulation as fundamental rights which will be applied regardless of journey length."
"The regulation does not impose any new technical requirements, but requests that carriers assume liability for their passengers."
"We also took into account the current economic climate and its impact on companies targeted by this regulation, by offering an exemption period of four years, which can be renewed once."
"I think that once this regulation comes into force in 2013, it will help achieve the objective of harmonising and consolidating passengers' rights at EU level, no matter which means of transport they choose."
"Rule of law in Russia (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the rule of law in Russia."
"I would like to ask Mrs Győri to take the floor on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, at the request of Baroness Ashton, the Hungarian Presidency of the Council is representing the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission during this debate."
"Baroness Ashton, as you may know, is travelling in northern Africa and in the Middle East this week."
"I wish to thank you for raising the issue of the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Russia."
"Despite some very positive signals from President Medvedev last year, the actual human rights situation in Russia and, in particular, in the Northern Caucasus region, remains deeply preoccupying. Violence, harassment and intimidation against activists, lawyers and independent journalists are of great concern to us."
"The number of cases to support this statement is unacceptably high."
"The brutal attacks on Russian journalists, Oleg Kashin and Anatoly Adamchuk, and environmental activist, Konstantin Fetisov, are among the latest reminders of the climate of insecurity and intimidation that journalists, activists and human rights defenders in Russia face in their day-to-day work."
"Despite assurances at the highest levels, the perpetrators are rarely brought to justice and sentenced."
"Accountability for violence and intimidation against human rights defenders - let me mention the cases of Mrs Estemirova, Mrs Politkovskaya, Mrs Barburova and Mr Markelov among a great number of others - remains an important test for the independence and efficiency of Russia's judiciary."
"As long as the crimes remain unsolved, a climate of impunity will continue to prevail."
"There are, however, also positive developments."
"I should mention here the Moscow City Council's decision to authorise peaceful and regular demonstrations - which were forbidden until last year - such as those in support of Article 31 or the day of press rallies."
"We have welcomed this decision."
"At the same time, we continue to receive reports about arbitrary arrests of peaceful demonstrators, including opposition leaders, at these very same authorised demonstrations, as well as others across the country."
"This is a matter of serious concern to us."
"Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association are preconditions for the development of modern societies."
"All of these freedoms are enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation."
"They also form part of the commitments that Russia has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The EU urges Russia to uphold its commitments and guarantee this right to citizens."
"President Medvedev has asked his Presidential Human Rights Council to examine the Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and Magnitsky cases."
"We very much welcome this decision."
"The EU has made no secret of its serious concerns with the way these cases have been handled."
"President Medvedev has often spoken out against what he has termed the legal nihilism prevailing in Russia."
"The EU stands ready to support Russia's efforts to overcome this, starting with the reform of its judicial system."
"Convinced that real modernisation needs established respect for the rule of law and its equal and fair application, we have put the rule of law at the core of our partnership for modernisation."
"In this context, concrete activities have already been prepared - for example, the setting up of an appeal system for civil and criminal court cases in Russia - in close cooperation with the President's administration and the Council of Europe."
"We are ready to work with Russia on this, as well as on new projects on corruption and the Hague Conventions."
"The situation in the Northern Caucasus is particularly worrying and needs urgent action."
"We welcome the new strategy for economic and social development and the efforts by Deputy Prime Minister Khloponin, but much more needs to be done to provide a lasting response to the barbaric acts of terrorism against civilians."
"The continuing immunity and impunity of security forces operating in Chechnya is fuelling grievances and terror in the region and is a source of deep preoccupation for us."
"We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who have fallen victim to aggression because of their professions or beliefs, as well as the courageous ones who cannot be deterred from their civil engagement in such a precarious environment."
"Overall, the current report has not been a very positive one."
"However, there are positive signs in the situation of human rights in Russia."
"These are often offset by backward developments and, overall, have not been enough to achieve real improvements, but we must not be discouraged."
"The significant body of European Court of Human Rights case-law provides an important incentive for the development of Russian law with regard to respect for human rights."
"We are engaged in a serious dialogue with Russia on human rights."
"Russia accepts this and, of course, also uses it to criticise what it sees as imperfections in the EU."
"We will continue with that dialogue."
"There is no alternative."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, those who know Russia will know that what passes for a legal system there does not measure up to the normal criteria of the Rule of Law."
"This affects Russia's relations with the rest of the world and equally with its own citizens."
"It follows that, when the European Union deals with Russia, it must take into account a variety of non-legal factors, notably, political interference, corruption and occasionally violence."
"The relationship between Russia and the West, then, is subject to uncertainty, not to mention the complete absence of transparency and accountability."
"Where Russia's own citizens are concerned, they lead lives more affected by arbitrariness and violence than can be reconciled with the European Union's commitment to universal human rights."
"Attempts to transform Russia have failed, so the European Union has no alternative but to live with the awkward interface between its own legality and Russia's non-legality."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, the model of power sharing between the state and the members of society determines the content of political decisions, while the predictability of the decision-making process and the correct enforcement of decisions are guaranteed by the honesty, professionalism and independence of the judiciary."
"The European Union and Russia can do business together only if there is compatibility between their power-sharing models, their decision-making mechanisms and their judiciary systems."
"The achievement of such compatibility is an exercise in partnership and cooperation, in consensus, confidence and interoperability-building, not in advocacy, lecturing and finger-pointing."
"Russia is a full member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Consequently, it is the Council of Europe that has competence to look into the functioning of democracy and the Rule of Law in Russia."
"The European Union should therefore rely on the Council of Europe in order to achieve, together with Russia, a common area of freedom, democratic security and justice."
"Moreover, since the European Union is itself on the way towards accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, it should use its future status as a party to that convention to accelerate convergence and interoperability with Russia in the field of democracy and the rule of law."
"Years ago, when the European Parliament had little more power than a militant NGO, its only tools were the rhetoric of naming and shaming."
"Today, after Lisbon, we are a powerful political institution."
"This imposes on us more responsibility, pragmatism and self-restraint."
"We should not let ourselves be led by emotions."
"We should not be casual with our values either."
"We are not allowed to be simultaneously prosecutor and judge."
"We should not act on the basis of mere allegations, rumours or various interest lobby groups."
"Our credibility, generated by the fairness and maturity of our approach, as well as our firmness and openness, is the best weapon we have in our dialogue with Russia at a time when our citizens have instructed us to develop a strategic partnership with Russia, not to restart the Cold War."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we consider Russia to be an important partner of the European Union."
"Therefore, we expect Russia to respect her international obligations and implement the constitutional rights of her own citizens."
"It is a fact that violations of human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law have become commonplace in Russia."
"Unlawfulness and widespread corruption led to the emigration of 300 000 citizens from Russia last year alone."
"It is hard to envisage both foreign and domestic business investments in such a climate."
"The Russian authorities are evidently implementing unconstitutional law and order."
"The situation in the North Caucasus is one of the vilest examples of that."
"The Russian constitution provides a basis for a multi-party system, but de facto it has become a one-party system with a marginalised parliament."
"I would like to ask the representative of the Council which punitive measures and sanctions will be applied against the Russian officials who are directly responsible for human rights abuses and perversion of the rule of law."
"The European Union must be consistent in its policy towards third countries."
"It would discredit the European Union if we turned a blind eye to some severe offences in some countries, while imposing sanctions on other countries for identical offences."
"We cannot continue normal relations unless concrete improvements are made in Russia."
"We have to face the truth."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite its excellent constitution, the Russian Federation is still not a state under the rule of law, because there is a huge gap between constitutional law and constitutional reality."
"The fundamental requirements of a functioning state under the rule of law - an independent judiciary and a free press - are unfortunately lacking."
"As one sarcastic commentator said: 'The best Russian court is in Strasbourg'."
"The fact is that around one third of the cases brought before the European Court of Human Rights come from Russia."
"Russian citizens do not have any confidence in their own courts, which only rarely dispense justice."
"This is also clear from the fall in the number of appeals."
"The country is headed by two lawyers, President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin, who have repeatedly expressed their intention of combating legal nihilism."
"However, their words, which are usually followed by completely contrary actions, have been shown to consist merely of legal cynicism."
"None of the courts in Russia dare to pass judgment without consulting higher authorities."
"This system of telephone justice has created judges who are no longer independent and who are more concerned about their own safety and progress than about justice."
"The Khodorkovsky case clearly demonstrates this."
"An employee of the justice system has recently said that Judge Danilkin's judgment was dictated to him from above."
"The reconviction of Khodorkovsky and Lebedev is a sign that the rule of law in Russia remains in the era of the gulags."
"As in Soviet times, the judgment was made in advance by the political leadership."
"Controlled democracy goes hand in hand with controlled justice."
"Although the Russian justice system is the embodiment of the punitive state, it fails completely when it comes to solving, prosecuting and passing judgment on politically motivated crimes."
"The attacks and murders of journalists have created a climate of fear and oppression."
"Conditions in Russian prisons are also appalling."
"One example of this is the case of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who uncovered a case of corruption and, as a result, was imprisoned arbitrarily and without charge."
"He died a horrible death in prison because of a lack of medical treatment."
"A modernisation agreement between the EU and Russia will only be successful if it is based on a modernisation agreement between the Russian leadership and its own population."
"This involves ensuring that the rights of the citizens, which are guaranteed under the constitution, are finally respected and fulfilling the obligations which have been entered into with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe."
"Russia needs to make the transition from a controlled democracy to a developing democracy."
"Essential prerequisites for this include free and just elections to the Duma and the Presidency, an easier process for registering political parties, which meets European standards, and a fair election campaign which gives all the candidates the same opportunities and access to the public media."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, Russia is an important partner for the EU on many fronts, but we cannot pretend that Russia is a genuine democracy with a rule of law."
"Unsolved murders of journalists and human rights defenders to politically-motivated show trials with acquiescent judges say it all in my view."
"Why, then, is Russia tolerated as a member of the Council of Europe?"
"That is a very good question."
"Undoubtedly, the Kremlin treasures this international legitimisation of a government described in the US diplomatic cables recently leaked by WikiLeaks as a virtual Mafia state."
"Conversely, the Council of Europe is discredited by its continued acquiescence towards Russia's authoritarian government."
"The European Court of Human Rights has a backlog of 27 000 cases from Russia alone, yet a Russian judge on the court is able to order the British Government to give British prisoners the right to vote."
"This not only exposes the absurdity of Russia's membership of the Council of Europe, but also encapsulates why the Council of Europe is, in my view, increasingly ignored internationally."
"Sadly now, and as a result of this, many Britons, including politicians, think it is time for the UK to review its membership of this organisation and its very intrusive court."
"(FR) Mr President, this House thinks it can lecture Russia on human rights."
"It would do better to put its own house, that of the European Union, in order."
"For example, Mr Tannock mentioned Mr Julian Assange, a dissident publicist and founder of the WikiLeaks site, whose actions I do not, for all that, endorse."
"He has been detained for weeks in the UK because of a totally outrageous and ridiculous extradition request from Sweden, and it is plain to see that this could be a step towards his being handed over to the US."
"Indeed, Mr Assange has been accused of rape by two young women, one of whom actually pressed charges on the grounds that the condom tore during consensual intercourse."
"The other accused him of surprising her in her sleep following earlier consensual intercourse."
"Who are they trying to kid?"
"It is obvious that if these two young women did not want to be 'raped' by Mr Assange, they should not have slipped into his bed naked!"
"They have not been outraged; they have been honoured."
"This example illustrates the degree to which extreme freedom ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker but the speaker continued off-microphone)"
"Dear colleague, this is a discussion on Russia."
"The item on the agenda is the situation in Russia."
"I am sorry, but we cannot change the topic in the middle of the discussion."
"(NL) Mr President, we are having this debate today because the Russian leaders and, in particular, President Medvedev, have themselves so often emphasised the importance of the rule of law to the modernisation of Russia."
"At the same time, though, we are finding many specific examples of things which are impeding that very modernisation; for example, if I look at corruption, which is reportedly continually on the increase, despite a good, new corruption law being in place, or if I look at the Yukos case; or the repeated arrests of opposition members and the human rights activists who were awarded our Sakharov Prize."
"The modernisation that is being declared in Russia has not yet actually become a reality."
"Given that we are supposed to be working together with Russia on the Partnership for Modernisation, and supposed to be negotiating an EU-Russia agreement, I find it unbelievable then that only five sentences in the progress report on the Partnership for Modernisation have been devoted to the modernisation of the rule of law."
"I also think that we need to develop more expertise at home."
"What I want to do, and we will also be doing that together in the report that Parliament is to prepare on Russia, is call for the promotion of the rule of law."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was not able to be here."
"In recent months, Baroness Ashton has worked with the Council to improve internal EU coordination on cooperation with our strategic partners, including Russia."
"With regard to her efforts to achieve a coordinated position, I think it would have been sensible to involve her in this debate."
"None of the other strategic partners of the EU is as close to us as Russia, either geographically or in relation to our historic experiences."
"This is why we take great interest in the internal political developments in Russia."
"At this point, I would like to make specific mention of the work programme drawn up jointly by the coordinators of the Partnership for Modernisation, both in Russia and in the EU."
"This joint work programme for modernisation contains important measures which will provide active support for the development of the rule of law in Russia."
"This is the right way of ensuring that our partnership brings real benefits, in particular, for the citizens."
"The initiative to modernise Russia launched by the Russian President gives the country's international partners the opportunity to begin a fruitful cooperation with Russia."
"We must make use of this opportunity."
"As my fellow Members have already said, if the modernisation process is to be sustainable, it must not only be based on technological developments."
"A modern Russian economy must be founded on the reliable principles of the rule of law."
"Only when citizens and business people can rely on the rule of law will they have the courage to introduce innovations and make investments."
"Let us take the hand that Russia has reached out to us and help the country to modernise."
"(PL) Mr President, in common with many of my fellow Members who have already spoken, I agree with the obvious statement that Russia is a strategic partner for the European Union in terms of geopolitics, international security and economic matters."
"It is also no wonder that we are so interested in the situation in the most important of our neighbours."
"It is now turning out that there are some very alarming trends emerging in the country."
"I would like to quote from some social research recently carried out, according to which only 3% of Russians believe that they have any influence over political life in their country, 61% believe that they cannot defend their rights effectively and 82% believe that state representatives do not observe the laws enacted and in force in Russia."
"This is a sorry state of affairs in a country whose development is so important to us, but relations between Europe and Russia should not, under any circumstances, stop at development in a strictly economic sense and economic modernisation."
"Human rights and the rule of law are also important aspects upon which we should concentrate, as is the case for our other neighbours, including Belarus, for example."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is important, alongside our wide-ranging cooperation in the field of business and in the face of global challenges, as has already been said, that we keep the subject of the rule of law on the agenda in all our discussions with Russia."
"In recent weeks, we have discussed the stability of the Mediterranean region on many occasions and we have defined what the concept of stability does not consist of, namely, authoritarian structures."
"At the same time, this means that for Russia, stability cannot be based on political influence over the courts or the persecution of journalists and of people who stand up in support of human rights."
"Therefore, from my point of view, it is always the right time to discuss this issue."
"I hope that we can make it clear to Russia during the course of the practical relationships which we will be entering into in the near future that it is putting its own future at risk if it does not establish the rule of law."
"Madam President, there has been a sequence of tens of independent journalists and civil activists being murdered in Russia - for example, Politkovskaya, Estemirova and Magnitsky - but not one crime has been cleared up and not one murderer has been brought to justice."
"The Kremlin regime, by its unwillingness to bring about justice and transparency, can be seen as complicit in these crimes."
"Yesterday, the young assistant judge, Natalya Vasilyeva, dashed the network of falsehood around the Khodorkovsky trial by declaring that the verdict was not reached by the judges, but was dictated to them from above."
"Issuing a visa ban for the officials responsible for Magnitsky and other cases is one concrete measure to show that the EU is serious about the improvement of the rule of law and transparency in Russia."
"The fact that the Russian authorities have become so nervous about the very idea of a visa ban shows what a huge positive potential the EU really has to bring about changes in the situation."
"Madam President, many of us in this House see Russia as part of the great family of European nations and had hoped that after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we would see Russia moving closer to the European Union."
"Sadly, that has not been the case."
"The current Russian leadership has chosen its own path, and it is one which causes great distress to those of us who wish to see freedom and democracy and the rule of law for the Russian people."
"The Commissioner here today has more experience than most of us in dealing with Russia, and no doubt will have his own experience there, but I hope that the Commission will put pressure on the High Representative to adopt a new policy towards any country whose leaders constantly flout the values we hold dear."
"Let us talk to them and engage with them on trade, as we need to."
"Let us endeavour to discuss with them human rights, as we should, but let us not allow their leaders to launder their money through Europe's banking systems, to educate their children in our schools or universities, or to take holidays in our holiday resorts."
"If we applied that equally to all authoritarian leaders across the world, we would start moving towards what one could call an ethical foreign policy."
"Madam President, I join with colleagues who are saying that we need smart measures to deal with authoritarian regimes which violate human rights."
"I would like to ask the Council and Commission Representatives here whether they are prepared to take measures against those who violate human rights, in the manner indicated in Parliament's resolution of 16 December 2010, which called for an asset freeze and visa bans on those 60 officials implicated in the case of Mr Magnitsky, who unfortunately died in prison in Russia."
"Would there be one or two courageous foreign ministers - or indeed Ms Ashton's representatives - who would take up this initiative, and if it proved to be true that Judge Viktor Danilkin did write the verdict on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev taking direct orders from the Moscow city court, would such a judge be on their list?"
"(SK) Madam President, Russia is one of the most important and most stable partners of the European Union."
"It is a country where democracy does not have a very long tradition, and it might be said that Russia is still getting used to democratic rule."
"We must also remember that it is a country which is still struggling with relentless Islamic terrorism, and the social standing of the security services is therefore higher than it is over here."
"From this standpoint, it is necessary to judge the frequent departures from our usual standards for the democratic functioning of a state in a principled and sensitive way."
"It is good to have proper discussions with our Russian friends on all of the issues that concern us regarding the running of the country by the Russian authorities."
"However, this dialogue must be businesslike, in a spirit of partnership, and motivated by an effort to improve the functioning of the democratic system in Russia, rather than by the lecturing of a self-styled custodian of global democracy."
"Let us negotiate with Russia as with a friend, in a correct manner, openly and decently."
"After all, we have a common interest in the peace, harmony and prosperity of Europe."
"Madam President, in my opinion, Mr Werner Schulz has drafted a resolution which is very well founded with arguments and draws correct conclusions."
"However, I am not sure that I understood the point made by Mr Fleckenstein."
"If the Rules of Procedure do not allow me to ask a question any more, I would still like to put this to him."
"Was he suggesting that we should refrain from supporting this resolution, or was he expressing the opposite, namely, wholehearted Socialist support for adopting it right now?"
"Madam President, I am sorry, I was not listening."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I was not sure whether Mr Fleckenstein was suggesting we support this resolution by Werner Schulz and others, or calling for us to refrain from adopting it at this part-session?"
"Madam President, I will vote for the resolution, yes."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, first of all, I wish to thank all the Members for the pertinent questions they raised during the debate."
"I very much share the concerns expressed here by many of you."
"I believe that the European Union as a whole will have to continue raising these concerns at all levels with our Russian interlocutors."
"We should not shy away from speaking directly when we have real and concrete issues to raise."
"If we are to act as strategic partners - and I believe that we are strategic partners of Russia - we must also be prepared to tackle difficult issues."
"Two things in particular delighted me during this discussion."
"The first is that nobody questioned the fact that Russia is an important strategic partner for the European Union."
"Second, there was a general consensus in this room that modernisation and the establishment of a fully-fledged democracy and the rule of law has not yet finished in Russia, and there are many problems with the workings of democracy there."
"I will certainly bring all the points raised to the attention of the High Representative in order for us to follow through the various means at our disposal."
"I am sure the coming visit of the Russian Government to Brussels on 24 February will provide us with a good opportunity to reiterate our concerns."
"Russia is a permanent issue on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council."
"You may know that since last year, a regular European Council meeting has been dedicated to discussing issues with our strategic partners."
"This happened first - and most recently - in September 2010, and I think Mr Van Rompuy will do the same in the course of this year."
"I shall now answer some of the specific questions Members have put to me."
"First, on Ms Hautala's question on human rights, I would point out that the High Representative takes Parliament's resolution of December 2010 very seriously."
"The circumstances surrounding the deaths in pre-trial detention of Sergei Magnitsky and Vera Trifonova must be duly investigated and the Foreign Affairs Council will, of course, pay special attention to that."
"We continue to raise these and other concerns at all levels, not only in the twice-yearly human rights consultations, but up to summit level, insisting on Russia upholding international commitments."
"Any decision on restrictive measures would be for the Council to take."
"Such instruments should be wielded wisely on the basis of clear evidence."
"First of all, we keep calling on Russia to ensure a proper investigation."
"I would say to Ms Oomen-Ruijten that human rights are at the core of the negotiations on the new agreement and will be addressed on a number of fronts."
"We can assure you that the commitments of the EU and of Russia to uphold human rights, including those of persons belonging to minorities, will figure very prominently in this agreement and indeed constitute an essential element of the future agreement."
"In conclusion, I will briefly sum up some of my previous points."
"The rule of law and independence of the judiciary must remain an integral part of the modernisation effort currently under way in the Russian Federation."
"The European Union must stand ready to support Russia in these efforts."
"Freedom of speech, assembly and association are the building blocks on which all Western democracies rest."
"Russia should uphold the legal commitments which it has entered into as a member of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the OSCE."
"The North Caucasus region remains a source of deep concern for us."
"We must encourage Russia to seek a sustainable solution to this endemic problem in the region."
"The important thing to bear in mind is that, in spite of the many concerns we have and the number of challenges Russia is currently facing, there have also been a number of positive developments."
"We must take President Medvedev at his word and continue to engage in a serious dialogue with Russia on human rights."
"So if there are cases, we have to be alerted and we have to follow what is happening in Russia very closely."
"Thank you very much for your valuable comments."
"The High Representative will be duly informed of your opinion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday on Thursday, 17 February 2011."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11:45 and resumed at 12:00)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The international press has discussed at length the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and there actually seems to be every indication that this case has been exploited for political purposes."
"The recent statements made by Judge Danilkin's press officer clearly show the Russian justice system's lack of independence."
"On the other hand, it is important to stress that this is not an isolated case."
"On the contrary, the NGOs operating in Russia regularly report that the standards for a fair trial are not met in this country."
"Furthermore, in September 2010, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly asked the authorities in Moscow to adopt reforms to guarantee the independence of the justice system and to end the harassment of lawyers."
"Lastly, it is important for us to stress the critical situation in the North Caucasus, a region where a climate of impunity reigns and where, even worse than this, victims are afraid to defend themselves so as not to put themselves even more in danger."
"If they want to show their credibility through announcing their intention to respect the rule of law, the Russian authorities clearly need to make greater efforts than they have done so far."
"in writing. - The rule of President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin is not compatible with the rule of law."
"For more than 10 years, Putin and Medvedev tolerated, and possibly protected, an appalling catalogue of abuses and crimes, including stage-managed trials, press control and political murder."
"The horrendous record of lawlessness in Russia is not a question of private delinquency."
"The real problem is state-sponsored lawlessness."
"The Russian justice system, and indeed the Russian state, never dealt with crimes aimed at journalists, human rights campaigners and whistle-blowers in the army or in the judiciary."
"The lawlessness in Russia was regarded for too long as an accident or as a problem beyond state control."
"EU policy should hold the Russian authorities responsible for their collusion with criminal elements."
"Recent developments seem to indicate that the second Khodorkhovsky trial was conducted at the behest of high political figures."
"The extrajudicial record of the Russian state is already a tradition."
"The EU's policy should take stock of this deplorable practice."
"The usual soft EU rhetoric is not appropriate."
"It should be replaced by a resolute policy, including credible warnings that future cooperation with Russia requires an immediate improvement in Russian law enforcement."
"At the start of his term of office, Mr Medvedev promised Russians a 'dictatorship of law' and full democracy."
"The Russian President is, I think, aware of the fact that his country is struggling to build a democratic state under the rule of law and to create a modern economy which can respond to global challenges."
"Recent events in Russia, in particular, the numerous attacks on journalists and representatives of independent non-governmental organisations, and the judgment handed down in the Khodorkovsky case, mean that there are grounds for wondering whether there is any real understanding of human rights and fundamental freedoms behind the noble-sounding demands."
"Russia's observance of its international obligations can also be considered controversial in a number of respects."
"The unresolved conflicts in regions such as Nagorno-Karabakh, Transnistria and Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be ended as soon as possible, in accordance with international law and the obligations undertaken by Russia."
"Russia should fulfil unconditionally all the provisions of the 2008 agreement between Russia, the European Union and Georgia."
"In particular, the representatives of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM Georgia) must have guaranteed and unlimited access to the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, in order to guarantee peace and stability in these regions."
"in writing. - The problem of independent courts and the imitation of democracy, free speech and rule of law seems to be understood by a wide audience."
"After all, the EU should know how to recognise such a problem."
"Nonetheless, it seems bizarre that at the same time, some Member States wish to override common understandings and even agreements, such as the EU Common Position 2008/944/CFSP."
"Ceterum censeo - France has decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action."
"Corrigendum to a text adopted: see Minutes"
"Madam President, I hope I can make myself heard above the din."
"I wonder if you could advise me when action is going to be taken in this House to prevent Members constantly having to run the gauntlet between the lifts from their offices and this Chamber and being accosted by people - whether they are lobbyists, assistants or whatever - trying to thrust myriad pieces of paper into our hands as we approach this Chamber to vote."
"This place is getting to look more like a university students' union than a Parliament, Madam President, and I hope you will take action to stop it."
"Thank you for the suggestion, Mr Bradbourn."
"We will pass your observations to the Quaestors so that they may take the necessary measures."

"Although I was not able to vote, my vote is against."
"In addition, I wanted to bring it to Parliament's attention that this proposal for a decision on the European patent is pending a decision of the Court of Justice, which is expected on 8 March."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Madam President, the aim of the Services Directive, which entered into force in December 2006, is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union and get rid of all protectionist barriers, arbitrary hindrances and any discriminatory rules."
"In any case, the European Parliament has always insisted that this directive must not form a pretext for dangerous deregulation and liberalisation of the sector, thereby harming workers' rights."
"The country of origin principle, which was criticised as paving the way for social dumping, was discarded and replaced by the destination country principle."
"I voted in favour of this report because, with regard to the implementation of the directive in question by the Member States, it puts particular emphasis on unjustified delays and failures, as well as a number of issues relating to its interpretation and application."
"I will finish here, Madam President, because speaking in these circumstances is rather difficult."
"(PL) Madam President, development of the European services market plays an absolutely essential role in stimulating economic growth in the European Union."
"It is therefore very much to be welcomed that the European Parliament is closely examining the way in which the Services Directive is being implemented."
"Further measures to support the proper development of the European services market are also essential."
"Our overriding aim was to facilitate the provision of services throughout Europe."
"We are therefore alarmed to note that some of the Member States are showing a tendency to enact and apply laws which are in no way justified by the directive's provisions."
"Artificial barriers are thus placed in the way of the activities of service providers."
"At present, as many as 90% of new jobs are created in the services sector."
"I therefore believe that an efficiently functioning directive is an essential condition for the development of the single market, and a key project for the European economy."
"I am thus pleased that we are starting to see examples of the directive achieving measurable results, such as the huge number of notifications of amendments to legislation that we are receiving from the Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, I voted with great conviction against the adoption and application of the Services Directive, also known as the Bolkestein Directive."
"The aim of the directive should have been to create greater competition in Europe, assisting in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Unfortunately, however, the real aim appears to have been to beat down and attack our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In Italy, there are sectors that represent real strengths, such as beach concessions, in which the owners have invested all their possessions and made enormous sacrifices."
"Now, thanks to this directive, they have lost everything."
"This is not the system we should be bringing in, with a bureaucratic Europe and major corporations and multinationals that want to invade Italy and overpower our enterprises."
"We cannot allow it and I will stand shoulder to shoulder with these small and medium-sized enterprises and defend them, so that we look after our traditions and Italy's strengths."
"(SK) Madam President, the Services Directive currently in force requires that all EU countries eliminate bureaucratic obstacles and make life easier for entrepreneurs."
"However, the implementation of the directive is stalling."
"The main problem areas are the failure to comply with the scope of the directive, delays in creating points of single contact, shortcomings in administrative cooperation and differences in mutual assessment."
"The report I have supported considers it very important to set up the points of single contact rapidly."
"They will be able to handle everything necessary for cross-border service provision, including information that is easy to understand on the formalities and administrative procedures of a given country."
"Services represent up to 40% of the gross domestic product of the Union."
"The elimination of unnecessary obstacles and delays could make a significant contribution to increased competitiveness and the creation of new jobs."
"(LT) Madam President, I believe that the evaluation of the Services Directive has given us a good opportunity to check whether this directive really facilitates improved development in the services sector and whether the provisions of the directive are being properly implemented in the Member States."
"It is essential for there to be agreement throughout all stages of the implementation of this directive that public services should not be covered by the directive, but that it should ensure social rights and comply with the requirements of employment law."
"It is clear that the Commission and the Member States must increase their efforts to set up high quality points of single contact in the Member States."
"Adequate funding must be earmarked for this, in order to ensure that these centres provide high quality information which is accessible."
"Madam President, there has been a misunderstanding from the earliest days of the European Union as to what we mean by a free market in goods and services."
"When my constituents voted in favour of EEC membership in 1975, they understood the common market to mean mutual product recognition."
"If you can sell a bottle of mineral water in the UK, you should be allowed to sell the same water in France, Germany or Italy and vice versa."
"What they found in practice is that it means standardisation - that 'the mineral water has to contain the following minerals but not any of these', that 'the volume must be not greater than x and not less than y' and so on. You can then find that a product that was never intended for export can be criminalised in its own nation of origin."
"That is what we have seen again and again, both with goods and with services."
"Instead of having an increase of consumer choice, we have a restriction of consumer choice, often driven by one particular producer somewhere in the European Union which happens to meet a load of specifications anyway and which sees EU legislation as the way to export its costs to its competitors."
"This is why our share of world GDP continues to shrink and how my country has shackled itself to a cramped and confined regional bloc."
"Madam President, I remember when the Services Directive first went through this Parliament in the last mandate, how controversial many of the elements were."
"I also remember personally, as the rapporteur for the trade and services report, the great controversy when I spoke about the need to liberalise many services - financial services, health services, education services, water services - to provide consumers with more choice and better services, rather than relying on clapped-out old state monopolies, which quite often taxpayers were underfunding."
"Here, we have this definition of services of general economic interest, as if somehow the disciplines that allow us to have a wonderful choice when it comes to supermarkets or other types of services do not apply to water, education and health."
"It is time that we moved on from the politics of 30 years ago when certain things could only be state-provided."
"The implication has been that they have been underfunded and not provided well."
"Let us move towards more service liberalisation throughout the EU and throughout the globe."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to explain why the majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has abstained from voting on this directive."
"It is good that we have made a decision and that the rights of people with disabilities are being respected."
"However, that is only the case over longer distances."
"Many of the other points are not worthy of a European directive."
"For example, because the directive only covers journeys over 250 kilometres, there are many countries where it does not apply."
"Cyprus, Malta and Luxembourg have no rights, in just the same way as some other Member States which do not have bus routes that are longer than 250 kilometres."
"The free movement of people, goods and services is one of Europe's central principles."
"Now it is the poorer passengers who are not protected, because some Member States have no system of passengers' rights."
"This is why we have abstained."
"There are some positive aspects, but also many negative aspects, and this is the reason for our abstention."
"(IT) Madam President, the proposal for a regulation tabled by the Commission in 2008 aims to introduce new, Europe-wide rights to protect bus and coach passengers which are similar to those applied to other means of transport, thereby assuring equal conditions of competition between carriers and the various modes of transport within the different Member States."
"A long and difficult negotiation with the Council, including recourse to a conciliation procedure, was required in order to reach the text voted on today."
"The final text can be considered a very satisfying and well-balanced compromise, since it succeeds in guaranteeing passenger rights without simultaneously imposing heavy burdens on carriers, which - lest we forget - are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The result of the conciliation procedure can quite reasonably be considered a success for the European Parliament, since some of our main requests were incorporated, namely in terms of its scope, fundamental rights for passengers irrespective of distance, derogations and, lastly, providing for accidents, cancellations and delays with suitable forms of reimbursement, assistance and compensation for passengers."
"(IT) Madam President, a new season of rights is upon us, but these rights could have been more widespread."
"We must be aware that at distances of less than 250 km, the rights of the most vulnerable, of disabled people, old-age pensioners, and persons with reduced mobility, are not addressed at all in this measure."
"If it is true that homogenised quality standards are being established, it is just as true that excluding local transport seriously limits the number of passengers affected."
"Implementation over the course of the next four years will allow the sector to prepare itself as well as possible, but we will also need to monitor the establishment of the enforcement bodies."
"The result of this process represents a victory for Parliament and is a positive sign of our attention to citizens' needs."
"However, compromise always implies mediation - and in this case concessions - of this House's aims."
"Basically, we have shown that we are good interpreters of needs, in contrast to the Council which has shown that it only represents interests."
"(IT) Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian on his excellent work in bringing this measure to its conclusion."
"Mr Mastella will allow me to disagree with him on the idea that this measure represents a great victory for our citizens."
"One cannot but note that citizens are only protected if they travel further than 250 km by coach or bus."
"Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if - as Mrs Meissner has already stressed - entire States such as Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection?"
"These are the reasons why our group abstained in the vote."
"We did not vote against the report because some rights are protected, such as those of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"That is why we abstained."
"As for the rest of it, we would ask to return to the issue as soon as possible in order to really protect our citizens."
"(FI) Madam President, first of all, I wish to say that it is excellent and important that we concern ourselves with the rights of our citizens."
"Whenever rights are spoken of, we must remember that obligations come with them and so there are no rights without obligations."
"There is a lot that is good and positive about the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"We also need to remember that panEuropean bus and coach companies differ greatly from one another."
"For example, in Finland, there are many small family firms, and we might ask whether we should be continually burdening these small companies with new costs and obligations, since they are struggling to make their enterprises profitable."
"I can say that we have shown flexibility on this issue in a variety of ways, and that the rights of different passengers have been taken into consideration."
"Acknowledging the needs of the disabled always brings with it clear added value."
"It is very important that we ensure that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are better able to travel and get about generally, and that greater account is taken of their needs."
"This is a good thing, but as I said earlier, the matter is slightly inconsistent, as when we talk about rights and obligations, it is also important to make sure that costs do not rise too high for those small companies in the bus and coach transport industry."
"Madam President, I voted in favour of this regulation, even though I feel that it certainly does not go far enough."
"However, it is a start, and sometimes in this Parliament and in the EU, we take only baby steps."
"That is what we have done today."
"It is unfortunate that some Member States are outside this regulation and, indeed, that it applies only to journeys of distances greater than 250 kilometres."
"I certainly would have preferred the ALDE line, where passenger rights would have applied to journeys of a much shorter duration."
"I am, however, pleased to see that some of the basic rights in the regulation apply to passengers travelling over shorter distances."
"Those rights, in particular, apply to persons with a disability, or indeed, persons with reduced mobility."
"Some of these rights include non-discriminatory access to transport and disability-related training for staff on coaches and buses."
"Unfortunately, Member States have a derogation period of up to ten years and, while small businesses do need adequate time to comply, I would ask and encourage Member States to try to ensure compliance with this regulation as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I strongly support passenger rights and, in particular, increased rights for disabled people."
"I am not particularly happy with the compromise reached."
"I would have preferred, in contrast to my colleague, a threshold of 200 kilometres, as this would have enabled Ireland to exempt rural areas of my constituency."
"I am thinking of parts of North and West Donegal, Mayo, and indeed Galway."
"Most rural areas are outside the 250 kilometre limit."
"The level of rights being sought in terms of compensation is disproportionate to the type of service operating in rural areas."
"I also want to refer to the cost, and that is principally an insurance cost, that could cause some operators to leave the market."
"In many cases, there is no alternative public transport service available."
"Of course, we have to accept the decision that has been taken today and, hopefully, the derogation period could give the opportunity to those who are outside the 250 kilometre limit to adapt."
"So, while I agree in principle, I had to abstain for the foregoing reasons."
"(SK) Madam President, every year, more than 70 million passengers in Europe travel by bus or coach."
"It is high time that a regulation came into effect protecting passenger rights in the same way as in air, water or rail transport."
"Passengers will have 12 basic rights applying to any length of journey."
"In addition to this, in the case of journeys in excess of 250 km, they will have the right to compensation for delays, assistance in case of accident or death, compensation for lost or damaged baggage, and better information."
"For small countries in particular, however, the 250 km minimum is rather extreme."
"I applaud the fact that passengers with reduced mobility will have the right to special assistance, as is already the case with air transport."
"In the future, I will certainly support the introduction of a common regulation to unify the already existing regulations on passenger rights in various transport systems, which will substantially clarify the entire system of passenger rights."
"(SK) Madam President, passenger rights in bus and coach transport, which is frequently used in the European Union, require a clear legal set-up, as is the case in air, rail and water transport."
"I consider the final text of the submitted regulation to be a satisfactory compromise."
"I am particularly pleased about the adoption of the 12 basic rights of passengers, applying to all passengers on this form of transport, regardless of the distance."
"I particularly welcome the recognition and consideration of the special needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"Guaranteeing the right to compensation for loss or damage to a wheelchair or other device providing mobility, and the training of staff on buses or coaches in the area of transport for disabled persons, are becoming important tools in the fight against discrimination and against the social exclusion of these people."
"(DE) Madam President, I have voted in favour of the report, because it represents a significant improvement in the current situation."
"We have been able to achieve a balanced solution which protects the rights of bus passengers and guarantees the continuing existence of small and medium-sized operators."
"The regulation covers journeys of more than 250 kilometres and gives bus and coach passengers the right to claim compensation if journeys are cancelled, overbooked or delayed by more than two hours."
"Bus operators are often small or medium-sized companies which would be brought to the brink of ruin by excessive claims for damages."
"This is one successful feature of the regulation which will ensure that compensation payments cannot get out of hand."
"As far as the distance of 250 kilometres is concerned, there is no reason why we should not allow the new legislation to come into effect and then see how it can be improved."
"(LT) Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cancian, because the document we adopted today really is a very satisfactory and well balanced compromise."
"It manages to secure the rights of passengers without, at the same time, imposing a heavy burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"European Union citizens will be able to feel better protected."
"This agreement also improves travel conditions for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"It also lays down clear rules on compensation for damages and the facilitation of assistance."
"I believe that it will make a significant contribution towards improving conditions for our citizens when travelling, and will give them more legal clarity in the case of an accident or other unforeseen events."
"(IT) Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian for his excellent work and, in particular, for the good result achieved in the conciliation procedure with the Council."
"Both from the point of view of the directive's scope as well as the incorporation of some 12 basic rights within the proposal, the compromise obtained represents an important step in protecting the rights of passengers."
"The proposal takes the rights and needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility into due account, particularly with regard to non-discriminatory access to transport, the rights to compensation in the event of loss of, or damage to, mobility equipment, submission and handling of complaints, disability-related training for staff on buses or coaches, and information to be provided during the journey."
"The final text has also managed to guarantee the rights of passengers without, at the same time, putting pressure on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises and could not have borne heavy burdens."
"Madam President, while I acknowledge that there are many positive aspects to this report - and I strongly support the right of those with disabilities to have access to transport and to compensation - I believe that these kinds of schemes should be put in place by national governments."
"I also believe that the financial burden associated with this proposal would be prohibitive for many transport providers."
"This Parliament must remember that many coach firms are privately owned, are relatively small and are under an increasing financial pressure as a result of the huge rise in fuel prices experienced over the last 12 to 18 months."
"For many private firms, and indeed government transport schemes, additional cost will only result in two things: higher ticket prices for customers and reduced routes."
"Indeed, it will put many in the voluntary sector - which runs many of the schemes for those with disabilities - out of business altogether."
"(IT) Madam President, it has been a long road to today's vote on this report so I should like to echo the compliments of my fellow Members directed to Mr Cancian, who fought so doggedly to get us here."
"All modes of transport have now finally got their own regulation on the rights of passengers."
"I think that the next step is to come up with a proper consolidating act that brings together all these different regulations."
"The scope is reasonable, even though we negotiated it on other premises, but the fact that we managed to include all Member States but two is certainly positive, as is the fact that many clauses were made obligatory, even at distances of less than 250 km, while giving up some other forms of compensation."
"During this morning's debate, some Members stated that there was no provision for suitable protection for passengers with reduced mobility, but fortunately, this has been proved false by the latest speeches."
"On the contrary, this protection is a great step forward for the civility of this compromise and we ought to be proud of that."
"(ET) Madam President, I am voting against this document, because the current act does not guarantee equal treatment of passengers."
"It does not compare with other modes of transportation, nor with passengers of different states."
"As a result, several small European Union states are left out of the regulation zone."
"The act functions only partially in several other Member States."
"The problem in connection with cross-border coach travel is also unresolved."
"Coaches are used by those on a low income and the young, including students and schoolchildren."
"It is therefore not acceptable for implementation to be deferred to a later date."
"(PL) Madam President, a compromise between proposals by the Commission and Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has been reached with regard to commercial vehicles and emissions standards, whereby the latter will be reduced for such vehicles from 203 g to 147 g per kilometre over a period of 10 years."
"The new emissions standard which has been introduced is acceptable to manufacturers and users and is important in terms of the costs incurred by users as a result of increased prices for such vehicles."
"This group of users is made up, primarily, of small and medium-sized enterprises, tradespeople and family businesses, and we have just been discussing EU instruments aimed at providing financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises during this part-session."
"One of the goals in this area is to reduce barriers to the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We hope that increased costs for fleets of light commercial vehicles resulting from limits on emissions and higher manufacturing costs will not become a significant barrier."
"In 2014, we will be able to check whether the principles behind the regulation have been implemented successfully."
"(DE) Madam President, the European Parliament has succeeded in putting in place an ambitious, long-term target in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission, which will restrict the CO2 emissions of small vans to a maximum of 147 grams per kilometre by 2020."
"This ambitious and yet realistic limit can be achieved by means of innovative environmental technology."
"The vehicles will be considerably cleaner, but they will remain affordable for small and medium-sized companies."
"This was particularly important for us, because it will not help climate change if the price of new vehicles is so prohibitive that the old vans remain on our roads and, in particular, remain a burden on the environment."
"I am pleased that we have voted on this motion today and that it has been adopted with an overwhelming majority."
"Madam President, we have just voted on a report called 'emissions performance standards for light commercial vehicles'."
"Like much EU legislation, it is a long-winded title for a real issue."
"Let me translate: light commercial vehicles are, of course, vans, and performance standards mean fuel emissions which depend on fuel burnt."
"Now, we have all seen the rising fuel prices at the pumps, but for sole traders like builders, plumbers and carpenters, running their van is a business-critical cost."
"They want fuel-efficient vehicles and fuel efficiency has always been a key part of their buying decision."
"On the production line in the General Motors factory in Luton, in my constituency, I have also seen that the innovation needed for improvements comes from the factory floor."
"There are some who think that just because targets are set in this House in Europe, they will be achieved."
"But the truth is that achieving those targets will mean the innovation comes, whether from vans or otherwise, and it will come from consumer demands and manufacturers' improvements and not just from European legislation."
"(GA) Madam President, I was sorry that I could not attend this debate but I had other meetings at the time."
"So, thank you for giving me the chance to say a few words now."
"In the 2020 strategy, we have put much emphasis particularly on renewable energies, and that is only right."
"But equally important in meeting our targets will be energy efficiency, particularly in relation to motor vehicles - private and commercial."
"Commercial vehicles are on the road every day and they travel huge distances."
"Through a directive like this, we can help to comply with the 2020 strategy in relation to fuel efficiency because it will compel designers to produce more fuel-efficient engines, and while the cost may be big in the short term, the savings in terms of miles per gallon travelled, and also in terms of the environment, are huge."
"(IT) Madam President, the Council has sent us a proposal for a decision that authorises an enhanced cooperation procedure in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection."
"The reason for this is that some Member States - including Italy and Spain - objected on a number of occasions to the adoption of the planned trilingual system of translation, which would end up becoming truly discriminatory, since it blatantly violates the principle of equal status for all official languages of the Union."
"Despite the numerous negotiations carried out so far and this morning's vote, it seems that the unanimous adoption of this regulation will be impossible."
"However, reasons of legal and institutional expediency would suggest, or seem to have suggested, that we should wait for the opinion of the Court of Justice, expected in the coming days, which might not only clarify numerous technical aspects of the unitary patent system, but also highlight all the jurisdictional consequences deriving from it."
"We did not choose this path and that is why I voted against."
"(DA) Madam President, listening to the debate here in this Chamber on enhanced European cooperation with regard to a unitary European patent, it is difficult not to sit here with a smile - an indulgent smile - on my face."
"Politicians from certain countries, whose own language is, in their opinion, the most important one in the world, have claimed that we will destroy the internal market in this area if we enter into enhanced cooperation."
"This is, of course, an absurd claim inasmuch as we do not have an internal market when it comes to the unitary patent."
"It costs around ten times more to obtain a patent in the EU than it does in the United States, corresponding to an annual turnover of EUR 250 million for our enterprises."
"It is therefore a good thing that we have finally voted the enhanced cooperation through today, so that certain countries can no longer be obstructive."
"Enough is enough!"
"We have not reached the goal, but today we have already made more progress in one day than we have done in the last ten years."
"(PL) Madam President, we have been holding debates on the creation of a unitary patent protection system for over 20 years at European level."
"The very complex system currently in force for registering patents, which is time-consuming and expensive in comparison to the American system, is no help whatsoever to European entrepreneurs."
"Patents play a significant role in the development and growth of a modern economy and in supporting scientific research."
"Given that global markets are becoming ever more competitive, we cannot afford to put off decisions on this matter any longer."
"We therefore need to step up work on the creation of a unitary patent market."
"Yet although we should support the idea, we must not ignore the controversial nature of many issues, for example, the question of language."
"Our aim should therefore definitely be to combat discrimination against the smaller, less-populated and often poorer Member States."
"(IT) Madam President, we live in a market in which our enterprises operate according to global competition."
"The basic premise of the reform of the language regime for patents, as announced by the Commission, is to reduce translation-related costs in order to be competitive on the markets where we compete with the United States, particularly the Asian market."
"I therefore wonder if it would not have been more efficient to produce a patent in just one language?"
"That would really help our enterprises to compete on the global market."
"Moreover, it is well known that there are currently two legal systems in Europe, with different characteristics and rules."
"I think it would have been a better idea to start harmonising them."
"Lastly, starting enhanced cooperation is not only against the spirit of the European Union, but it also harms the internal market, which is thereby subject to geographic segmentation and distortion of competition between Member States, meaning that some States will certainly find themselves worse off than others."
"(IT) Madam President, whilst, on the one hand, I applaud the objective achieved by Europe of equipping itself - after many years - with an important instrument such as the patent, which will finally allow the European Union to compete on level terms with other territorial organisations, I must also express my great regret that this result has been achieved to the detriment of other areas, like Italy, which has been a perennial advocate of strengthening the role of the Union."
"The decision to issue the patent in just one of the three working languages of the Patent Office will actually create inequality between Italian enterprises and those countries that form part of the proposed linguistic regime."
"I would recall that some months ago, I submitted a question to the Commission to defend the use of the Italian language."
"In the meantime, 25 countries out of 27 fell into line, which has led me to abstain."
"(PL) Madam President, no one is satisfied with the present answers to the problem of patent protection in the EU and the Member States."
"The introduction of a unitary patent protection system is therefore essential, both for the economies of our Member States and for the economy of the EU as a whole."
"In particular, the new system should help stimulate scientific research and innovation."
"The introduction of a relatively simple system based on a standardised form - although this is the subject of controversy - using three languages, although there has been talk of using one language or many languages, with translation into the mother tongue of the applicant, represents an important step."
"This will be particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises, many of which do not have sufficient financial resources to apply for patents."
"I hope that it will prove to be a key step in spurring into action the group of small and medium-sized enterprises which we frequently refer to as 'sleeping innovators'. We often discuss how to encourage this very group of businesses to introduce innovations and patent their own inventions, particularly in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"We want this new regulation to both mobilise these small and medium-sized enterprises and also to provide better protection for patented inventions in the European Union."
"(FR) Madam President, I voted in favour of Mr Lehne's report, which gives the European Parliament's consent to enhanced cooperation in order to create a unitary patent within the European Union."
"It is about time too!"
"Twenty years of effort to achieve a result, to arrive at the point where we start to take concrete action for European businesses, both our SMEs and our large companies, which have been waiting a long time for this major instrument for their competitiveness and growth."
"By giving its consent to enhanced cooperation, the European Parliament is showing just how interested it is in this particular enhanced cooperation procedure - and I would point out that this is the second time it has been applied - but it is also sending a very positive and very specific message to promote the innovation and competitiveness of our businesses."
"As has already been said, 25 of the 27 Member States have chosen to go ahead with this enhanced cooperation procedure so as to create a European Union unitary patent."
"I do not underestimate the difficulties that some of our Member States may still be experiencing, but let us move forward and set an example."
"That is what businesses are expecting."
"(ES) Madam President, I abstained because I think that the decision to create a unitary patent through enhanced cooperation is another failure by the Council."
"There is only agreement between nine Member States and the document itself acknowledges that the objectives cannot be achieved within a reasonable timescale."
"Competitiveness?"
"Efficiency?"
"In addition, the judgment of the Court of Justice on jurisdiction in terms of the language rules is pending."
"The Council should have made the effort to reach a common position, and perhaps it should have done more work on using a single language, taking into account the number of registrations and the language used in the majority of them, in order to make us more competitive in our global context."
"Once again, the national perspective of the Member States has resulted in a fragmented decision with no clear criteria regarding the use of three languages."
"If we implement measures such as this, we shall never make progress in consolidating the European project."
"(SK) Madam President, if the European Union is to boost competitiveness and become a world leader in innovation, its creative potential must be adequately secured."
"The EU patent system, however, suffers from many deficiencies, preventing the establishment of unitary patent protection, but also the development of the internal market, thereby reducing legal certainty for inventors and innovative firms."
"The provision of unitary protection of inventions in all Member States through the existence of a single European process for granting patents on the basis of a unitary system of patent law would expressly clarify a complicated system while, at the same time, reducing costs, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are having to pay up to three times higher costs than in the US, for example."
"Since the attempts to create unitary patent protection throughout the EU have failed to fulfil expectations, and in view of the fact that all of the legal preconditions stipulated for enhanced cooperation in the area of creating individual patent protection are fulfilled, I agree with the European Parliament giving its consent."
"(IT) Madam President, when, a century ago, Antonio Meucci's patent was not recognised by the American telephony industry, it was not because of a lack of English or his use of Italian, but instead the failure to meet a condition: he did not have the money to register his patent for another year."
"In a similar vein, we are now in a paradoxical situation and, quite apart from the vote, I think that the fact that a trilingual patent system is to be adopted, which excludes Italian, is basically a sign of the weakness of our government, its inability to make its voice heard in European politics, and the weakness of our political system, which reflects, above all, on research and innovation."
"On this issue, we need only recall the competitiveness study published last December, which shows that in recent years, Italy has willingly handed over EUR 4 billion to other countries that have welcomed our researchers."
"These researchers certainly no longer have any need for Italian, since they have learnt English, French and German and have all the tools required to submit these patents, to the detriment of Italian products."
"(IT) Madam President, once again, we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro-European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent."
"Twenty-five countries out of 27 and the overwhelming majority of Parliament support a proposal that regulates the field of patents and that has a real effect on the most innovative enterprises and those that are most orientated to international markets."
"By ruling ourselves out of this decision, we in Italy will expose our enterprises to the risk of not being suitably protected in Europe and across the world."
"It is quite incredible that a government that does nothing to spread Italian culture throughout the world, that cuts funds to cultural institutes and fails to value the language of the country that is host to the largest number of World Heritage Sites, can ride roughshod over the language issue while our enterprises have actually always asked for patents to be drafted only in English, which is now the lingua franca of the global economy."
"However, we have reached a result that allows anyone submitting patents to do so in their own language."
"Madam President, there was nothing that made it compulsory for Mr Barnier to force this through with such a hasty vote before the opinion of the Court of Justice which, as we know, will be expressed during the first week of March and will deal mainly with two crucial points: the use of one's national language to defend oneself before the European Union Patent Court and the very legitimacy of creating a patent court."
"As we well know, these are important issues to resolve before taking any decision."
"Hence, the Italian delegation of the Democratic Party (PD) decided to abstain."
"Madam President, this proposal is certainly not perfect, and indeed may have to be revisited as a result of the ECJ judgment in a few weeks."
"Nevertheless, I think it is a step in the right direction, and for that reason I supported it."
"I have attended a number of seminars here at the European Parliament in relation to innovation."
"General Electric have done some surveys right across the European Union which show that most people believe that progress out of recession can only be achieved through innovation."
"Innovation means research, development and new products."
"New products have to be patented, and the easier it is to do that, the better."
"We have to try and aim for a system right across the European Union that is as easy and as cost-effective as it is in the USA."
"We are a long way from that yet but, at the same time, we are at least trying to move in that direction."
"Therefore, I supported today's proposals."
"(NL) Madam President, I have abstained from voting on the Lehne report, not because I have any objections to the creation of a unitary patent protection scheme."
"Quite the contrary."
"Businesses in Flanders have been clamouring for such a scheme for a long time."
"The idea itself can only be welcomed, especially if we consider how costly and cumbersome the current procedure is, having to apply for a separate patent in each Member State."
"I abstained from voting because the language arrangements are still not entirely clear."
"It remains to be seen to what extent the draft Commission regulation will allow for the use of the official languages other ​​than English, French and German."
"In any case, I am, and will continue to remain, of the opinion that it should also be possible to submit a dossier in Dutch."
"(SK) Madam President, the codification of the previously mentioned provisions of applicable texts, together with the previously mentioned changes, will undoubtedly bring the necessary clarification to legal arrangements on radioactivity in food."
"In my opinion, however, in the context of adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, it would be desirable to reassess the legal basis of the proposed regulation, which must also take account of the new powers of the European Parliament in the area of public health protection."
"In this case, I agree with the opinion that Article 168(4b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides a legal basis for the proposal, since the direct aim of the measures passed on this basis is to protect public health, which is the case when (and I quote) 'laying down maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs'."
"(IT) Madam President, I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text, which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs."
"We are forgetting and letting it pass somewhat unnoticed that we are talking about waste from nuclear accidents."
"This means that we have to continue to pay close attention to the risks of nuclear plants and to the fact that these are the consequences of the rotten and poisonous results of what, in certain States, we insist on developing."
"It is therefore a measure that must inspire us all to be as vigilant as possible."
"Getting to the heart of the matter, I do, however, think that more could be done to bring in compulsory immediate notification, which would allow all risk factors to be dealt with together."
"Furthermore, there should be no way to avoid the requirement to notify government authorities in the event of an accident."
"(PL) Madam President, regulations ensuring that foodstuffs are not contaminated by radioactive substances came into being after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant."
"This is a very important issue, in particular, from the point of view of public health, but it is, at the same time, a difficult subject."
"Implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon means that certain regulations need to be updated, including these ones, even though there is a dispute between the European Commission and Parliament's proposals as far as the legal basis is concerned."
"Parliament cites Article 168(4) of the Treaty of Lisbon, whereas the Commission cites Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty."
"It is important to reiterate the need to protect consumers, but also to emphasise the need to protect farmers, who should receive compensation for the losses they suffer following an accident."
"The debate we have held has also shown the large differences in opinion when it comes to assessing possible threats, including levels of radiation caused by accidents or those from natural sources."
"The fact that an increasing proportion of the European Union's market is occupied by imported agricultural products and foodstuffs from various parts of the world should also be highlighted, since public health standards, including those ensuring that foodstuffs are not contaminated by radioactive substances, must be met."
"(IT) Madam President, the insertion of a new recital in the proposal for a codification of three regulations adopted between 1987 and 1990 laying down levels of radioactive contamination in case of radiological emergency brings the necessary ex post motivation to an existing article and justifies the right for the Council to exercise direct power in terms of adopting a regulation to promptly endorse the emergency measures proposed by the Commission."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Belet, that this cannot be disassociated from the article to which it refers."
"In any case, in the light of the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, we need to clarify whether this justification provides sufficient motivation for the reservation of implementing powers to be exercised by the Council and whether those implementing powers delegated to the Council are properly defined and framed."
"Citizens' interests in the effective management of post-accident situations must be guaranteed."
"The measures designed for this purpose include streamlining the procedure in the event of nuclear emergency and the clear assignment to the Commission of a supervisory role, which, at the same time, clarifies the regime of its acts."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I agree with the rapporteur's position regarding the consensus needed to conclude the agreement, now with new provisions in line with the EU's development cooperation objectives, as set out in Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"On the other hand, I believe that this approach was overly focused on commercial and economic concerns, and on free trade, to the detriment of a more robust approach to development, and I welcome the new provisions, which should be included in the revised agreement, especially as regards combating poverty, aid efficiency, the Millennium Development Goals and the link between migration and development."
"However, I am voting for this proposal because I believe that relations and trade with South Africa are essential for both parties."
"I voted in favour of this document, because it includes important amendments."
"It has to be welcomed that disarmament becomes an essential element of the agreement - to be more precise - on a par with democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law."
"These are very important provisions, contributing to peacekeeping and security in the region, as well as respect for human rights and the development of democracy."
"The principle of aid effectiveness (as a development cooperation objective) and priority for operations, which contribute, in particular, in the fight against poverty, towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), have been added to the agreement."
"It should be noted that obviously, from a South African development perspective, extending cooperation to many new areas is a point in the revised agreement's favour; and, moreover, extending cooperation in this way, which was provided for in the original 1999 agreement as simply a possibility, is what both sides wanted."
"Moreover, it is also important that much attention is focused on commercial, economic and free-market concerns, which should contribute to the region's economic development."
"This revised agreement introduces a number of amendments, especially regarding the development of democratic principles and cooperation on the aspects relating to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"I welcome the initiative for prioritising the operations which help achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), namely: the strategies aimed at reducing poverty, improving living and working conditions and creating new jobs."
"I think that an in-depth political dialogue needs to be established on combating terrorism and money laundering, on the financing of terrorism and organised crime, and on combating the manufacture of, trade in and accumulation of weapons."
"In addition, I advocate the need for us to focus as well on developing cooperation with the aim of improving the education and healthcare sectors."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"South Africa is a country that is developing rapidly in all areas and with which the European Union wishes to foster a special relationship."
"Following the positive recommendation by the Committee on Development and the approval of the Committee on International Trade, I supported the signing of this agreement, which will strengthen our cooperation with that country."
"I voted for the renewal of the EU-South Africa cooperation agreement, as amended in 2009, because it introduces a new dimension to cooperation between the European Union and South Africa."
"The initial 1999 agreement provided for trade cooperation, support to South Africa during its economic and social transition process, the economic integration of the country within southern Africa, and development cooperation."
"Today, the agreement has been extended to the following areas: the fight against poverty, the effectiveness of development aid, the implementation of the MDGs, the fight for security, the fight against weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism."
"These are areas of strategic cooperation which I believe are important, considering the European Union's active cooperation with South Africa and its influence in the southern African region."
"I welcome this new agreement, which is aimed at stepping up bilateral cooperation in a number of areas."
"I would stress the importance of children's rights, gender equality, combating violence against women, environmental cooperation, particularly on climate change, cultural cooperation, cooperation on combating drugs and money laundering, health cooperation and, in particular, the fight against AIDS."
"The link between cooperation and development should cover strategies aimed at reducing poverty, improving living and working conditions and creating employment, the participation of migrants in the development of their home countries, and cooperation to strengthen capacities, particularly in the health and education sectors, in order to offset the negative impact of the 'brain drain' on sustainable development in South Africa."
"I welcome our increased cooperation in these many new areas and am pleased with the new provisions on development that have been inserted into the revised agreement, in particular, as regards combating poverty, aid effectiveness, the Millennium Development Goals and the linkage between migration and development."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation as I support the implementation of new development-related provisions in the agreement."
"It is important to ensure effective monitoring by the EU authorities, as envisaged by the Treaty of Lisbon, so that it is possible to achieve the objectives of reducing and eradicating poverty in South Africa."
"South Africa is a country that has been inspiring interest, aid and esteem internationally since the end of apartheid due to the way in which, despite difficulties and setbacks, it has managed to make a relatively peaceful transition from a supremacist regime to a democracy in which universal suffrage prevails."
"It is impossible to recall this transition without evoking the inspirational figure of Nelson Mandela and his show of dignity, kindness and reconciliation, which is still having a positive effect on the country."
"Today, we can say that South Africa is a key geopolitical and geostrategic player in Africa, and an example to other countries that have not yet been able to free themselves from the dictatorships that are oppressing them and holding back their development."
"The EU has every interest in strengthening the ties that bind it to South Africa and in establishing partnerships that are mutually advantageous."
"I therefore support the amendment to the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the EU and South Africa."
"The Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part, came into force on 1 May 2004."
"Although this agreement, which was concluded in Pretoria on 11 October 1999, was set to be in force indefinitely, it provided for a review within five years of its entry into force."
"I therefore welcome this recommendation, which will bring an end to a long negotiation process, as the revised agreement was concluded in Kleinmond on 11 September 2009."
"It will enable the entry into force of a regulation introducing significant amendments to the original agreement, in particular, at the level of disarmament and of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as at the level of combating poverty by meeting the Millennium Development Goals, along with many other important amendments."
"Although I agree with the rapporteur on the precedence given to trade concerns to the detriment of a development approach, I am voting in favour of this recommendation as it represents another step forward by the EU in terms of development cooperation, and this will help to meet the objective of eventually eradicating poverty."
"This proposed amendment to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA), with a view to including a 'comprehensive development assistance envelope', should be examined in the light of the efforts that the EU has been making for South Africa to conclude an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), seeking to overcome criticism and legitimate resistance to both the current TDCA and what the EU intends to become the EPAs."
"The TDCA has exacerbated the economic asymmetries between the two parties to the EU's advantage, as it has increased its exports to South Africa."
"The EU's policies on the 'liberalisation of trade in goods, services and capital' have clearly failed."
"The worsening of the economic and financial crisis of capitalism bear this out."
"Competitiveness has been promoted instead of mutual assistance and reciprocity, imposing a division of labour that has meant the export of agricultural products from South Africa and the export of industrial products from the EU."
"The beneficiaries are the same as ever: the major EU powers and their economic interest groups."
"The consequences are plain to see, not only for developing countries, but also for EU countries such as Portugal: the weakening of productive sectors, an increase in external dependency, unemployment, poverty, etc."
"I voted in favour of this document because the revised agreement makes a number of interesting changes to the original agreement, in particular - with regard to development - the following: disarmament becomes an essential element of the agreement - to be more precise - on a par with democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law; the principle of aid effectiveness (as a development cooperation objective) and priority for operations contributing, in particular, in the fight against poverty, towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), have been added."
"I agree with the objective of strengthening support for the International Criminal Court and its work to put an end to impunity and to enforce international justice; cooperation on migration is also to be the subject of regular political dialogue, as is, in this context, the linkage between cooperation and development, including, but not confined to: strategies aimed at reducing poverty, improving living and working conditions and creating employment; participation of migrants in the development of their home countries; cooperation to strengthen capacities, particularly in the health and education sectors, to offset the negative impact of the South African 'brain drain' on sustainable development in South Africa; legal, expeditious and cost-effective ways for expatriates to transfer remittances to the country."
"The following are the most important aspects: peacekeeping and security in the region, as well as respect for human rights and the development of democracy."
"I support the conclusion of the agreement between the EU and South Africa to extend bilateral cooperation."
"In addition to consolidating the rule of law, important measures will be taken to combat terrorism and terrorist financing and to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction."
"The overwhelming support of the European Parliament for the agreement will lead to improvements in working conditions and in the healthcare system and to the reduction of poverty in South Africa."
"The Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa signed in Pretoria in October 1999 entered into force in 2004 with a clause for its revision within five years of the date on which it became effective."
"Today, seven years since the agreement was ratified, the European Parliament has managed to express its opinion on the negotiations led by the Commission on the basis of Council directives."
"The text was submitted to us for approval and I decided to vote in favour, since it primarily concerns itself with development in South Africa."
"Its fundamental purpose is to commit the two parties to the agreement to fight to try and definitively eradicate the issue of poverty, making a serious contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"However, this can only be brought to pass if South Africa manages to take real action on its own behalf by setting out a proper disarmament policy, which is thought to be the real foundation on which to base the development project in the country."
"in writing. - I welcome this agreement between the EU and South Africa which sets out new provisions on development, in particular, with regard to combating poverty, aid effectiveness and the MDGs."
"South Africa is an important partner both for trade and development relations."
"This agreement is situated within a specific context that the rapporteur seems to ignore."
"The European Commission is exerting an unprecedented amount of pressure on the countries of southern Africa, especially South Africa, in order to conclude harmful economic partnership agreements."
"The reference to the negotiations on the EPA and the suspension of all trade negotiations to make way for it are the very illustration of this blackmail."
"I am voting against this report, which validates, rather than condemns, the draft agreement by the Barroso Commission."
"An initial Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part, was concluded in Pretoria on 11 October 1999 and came into force on 1 May 2004 for an indefinite period."
"This agreement has a five-year review clause following its entry into force."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has also necessitated the adoption of a new agreement, so that the EU can exercise all the rights and obligations that were previously exercised by the European Community."
"The revised agreement concluded at Kleinmond in 2009 introduced a certain number of important amendments into the initial agreement, particularly the following changes in the area of development: disarmament, democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law, cooperation on disarmament issues and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - I abstained from voting on this issue because: (1) the Republic of South Africa possesses tremendous natural resources and is capable enough to resolve its own questions itself; (2) the level of corruption in South Africa is so high that the shadow economy accounts for more than 60% of its market; (3) there are countries which cannot solve problems themselves and are more significantly in need of EU financial support, and whose situation is more hopeless; (4) the EU may assist the Republic of South Africa in an advisory way."
"I voted in favour of the text tabled by Mrs Joly on the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa because, in the light of the new international situation that has come about over recent years, we need to revise the agreements with South Africa on trade, development and cooperation."
"In terms of economic relations, the agreements bring benefits for both parties' industries."
"For example, South Africa is an important commercial partner for Italy, both in terms of cofinancing projects and trade."
"A further aim of the revision of these agreements is to establish coordination on the fight against terrorism, partly in the light of the entry into force of the International Criminal Court, and also to open a conversation on common values and interests in areas such as migration, energy, space, transport and security."
"I voted in favour of the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, of the other part, which amends the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA)."
"Since the TDCA entered into force, the trade in EU goods with South Africa has increased steadily."
"The EU is South Africa's main trading partner; in 2009, the EU was the destination for about 34% of total South African exports and the source of about 35% of total imports to South Africa."
"The balance between imports and exports is clear, but my sole concern is with the production methods in South Africa for products exported to the EU: these should meet the same standards as those required of European producers in the same industry."
"These indicators suggest that the results of the first agreement concluded in 1999 can already be seen."
"Like the rapporteur, I would like the EU's development cooperation objectives to be respected, the foremost of these objectives being to reduce and ultimately to eradicate poverty."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation on the review of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and South Africa."
"By comparison with the original agreement, concluded in Pretoria on 11 October 1999, this revised agreement, concluded in Kleinmond on 11 September 2009, was aimed at extending the political dialogue between the parties in important areas such as the fight against weapons of mass destruction and against terrorism, along with stepping up development cooperation, with particular emphasis on operations that contribute to the fight against poverty, in the context of achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"I therefore believe that the amendments that have been introduced are to be welcomed."
"in writing. - Parliament consents to the conclusion of the agreement, and calls for the new development-related provisions in the agreement and the new cooperation arrangements it provides for to be applied in full and, when the agreement is implemented, to be closely monitored in the light of Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, i.e. in line with the Union's development cooperation objectives, of which the Union must take account in all the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries, the primary objective being to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation because I fully support its contents, particularly in terms of the desire to strengthen bilateral cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa."
"Since this is, above all, an economic and commercial agreement, the amended text supports the economic and social transition process in the Republic of South Africa, promoting regional cooperation and providing fresh impetus to the country's economic integration into the global economy."
"Partly as a result of my institutional roles, I think it is a priority to strengthen political dialogue with this country, particularly with regard to issues of specific interest for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States."
"In particular, I support the decision to direct a large portion of the EUR 980 million available to the EU for the period 2007-2013 to the creation of new jobs, as well as financing the construction in South Africa of the necessary infrastructure to provide basic services in terms of health and security."
"Pursuing these objectives with the real involvement of civil society means proceeding doggedly along the path to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and placing the eradication of hunger and all forms of poverty above all other goals."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this agreement as it will improve Europe's trade and development relations with South Africa, which are critical for the South African region and also for us."
"1999 marked the conclusion of the first Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of South Africa, which came into force on 1 May 2004."
"This first agreement had a distinctly economic character, being based on trade liberalisation, and it left little room for development cooperation."
"The review of this agreement, which was provided for therein, was concluded in 2009, and introduced important changes in development policy, in particular, cooperation on issues associated with disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the inclusion of the principle of the rule of law and human rights, the principle of aid effectiveness, particularly in matters concerning the fight against poverty, and achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"New areas were added in order to enhance cooperation: the fight against terrorism and organised crime; the prevention of mercenary activities; the fight against the manufacturing of, trade in and accumulation of small arms and light weapons; and cooperation on migration."
"I welcome the adoption of this agreement with a strategic partner of the EU and the institutionalisation of non-state actors as cooperation partners, thus making them eligible for financial aid."
"I supported the European Parliament's recommendation to amend the provisions of the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement in the field of rights, freedoms and security."
"I believe that it is important to introduce a results-based approach into development cooperation if we want to make progress towards achieving our Millennium Development Goals."
"The main objective of creating jobs addresses the central problem of the economic development of South Africa."
"For years, there have been calls for a concept for establishing small and medium-sized enterprises in the country."
"The EU, which is South Africa's most important trading partner, can provide valuable assistance in the process of economic and social transformation."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Joly on the revision of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of South Africa, which has been in force since 2004."
"In fact, the aim of said revision is to work out new possibilities for liberalising trade in specific sectors and, at the same time, adapting the agreement to the changed international context."
"In my opinion, it is essential to stress that this revision lays the foundations for improving and deepening dialogue between the European Union and South Africa on important issues such as migration, exploitation of energy sources and security."
"Given that the four agreements included in the Commission's proposal offer the possibility of enhancing the contribution made by the European Free Trade Association/European Economic Area (EEA) to reducing the economic and social disparities within the EEA, I am voting for this report."
"It is worth highlighting the agreement between the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and the agreement between the EU and Norway, two financial mechanisms for 2009-2014 which provide for a total package of EUR 1.8 billion, representing a 31% increase in the EEA financial mechanism and a 22% increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism against the previous period."
"These resources are available to Iceland, the 12 most recent Member States, and Portugal, Spain and Greece, helping to revive some of the European economies that have been most weakened by the crisis."
"in writing. - I voted against this report as I question the propriety of granting Iceland any concessions regarding the importation of fisheries produce into the EU when they continue to persist with their approach on the management of mackerel, with the negative impact this is likely to have on EU pelagic fishermen."
"Established in 1994, the agreement permits Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to participate in the EU's single market without conventional EU membership."
"In exchange, they are obliged to adopt all EU legislation related to the single market except those pieces of legislation that relate to agriculture and fisheries."
"Iceland can export fisheries produce to the EU tariff-free."
"It is a difficult pill to swallow that having blatantly disregarded international management of the mackerel stock and, in 2010, declared a catch of 100 000 tonnes, Iceland has the freedom to export its entire mackerel catch into the EU."
"While the fisheries concessions granted to Iceland may not have changed in the new agreement, Iceland's behaviour with regard to fisheries management has certainly changed and in this light, I would question if this agreement should be ratified."
"The purpose of this resolution is to give backing to four agreements between the European Union and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are intended to establish the contributions of these countries to reducing economic and social disparities within the European Economic Area and reinforce them in the light of the previous period."
"This proposal steps up the contribution of the states concerned and does not substantially alter fisheries concessions."
"In this regard, the period from 2009 to 2014 is essentially a renewal of what was agreed for the previous period, from 2004 to 2009."
"The unanimous vote by the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Fisheries is indicative of the non-controversial nature of this issue."
"The Commission has tabled a proposal for four agreements to Parliament."
"Two of these agreements, on financial mechanisms for the 2009-2014 period, provide for an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion."
"They relate to one agreement between the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway which represents a 31% increase in the European Economic Area (EEA) financial mechanism, and another relating to an agreement between the EU and Norway which represents a 22% increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism."
"The other two agreements are related to fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway between 2009 and 2014, and provide for their renewal."
"The concessions are the same for Iceland."
"For Norway, they have increased slightly, so there will be a provision for the renewal of the transit agreement which expired on 30 April 2009."
"I am voting in favour of the proposal because EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States, along with Portugal, as well as Greece and Spain, and the areas to be funded include the environment, especially climate change and renewable energy, civil society and the protection of cultural heritage."
"The conclusion of this agreement, adopted here today, follows the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) which has been in force since 1994, covering the states of the EEA/European Free Trade Association."
"At that time, five-year contributions were agreed upon by those states in order to reduce economic and social disparities within the EEA; naturally, we support this aim."
"The funding for this five-year period (2009-2014) has more than doubled the funds available for the previous period."
"These EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States, as well as Greece, Portugal and Spain, and may be used in a number of important areas, including environmental protection, human and social development and the protection of cultural heritage."
"In view of the enlargements of the EU and the worsening of the social and economic situation in many of its countries, as is the case with Portugal, we believe that it is important to increase these funds."
"As Chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and to the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the European Economic Area, I welcome this report."
"It was I who prepared the Opinion of the Committee on Fisheries on the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Koppa report on the Financial Mechanism relating to fisheries."
"Nevertheless, this does not indicate that all is well with EU-EEA fisheries matters."
"The refusal of Iceland to come to an agreement with the EU and Norway in relation to mackerel is highly regrettable and I strongly urge all parties to go back to the negotiating table"
"I agreed with this document, because since the entry into force of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1994, the EEA EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) have contributed to alleviating economic and social disparities in the EEA."
"The most recent five-year period of financial contributions expired in 2009 (EUR 1.467 billion)."
"The Commission's current proposal includes four agreements."
"These agreements provide for a package of EUR 1.8 billion, comprising a 31% increase in the EEA financial mechanism and a 22% increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism, compared to the period 2004-2009."
"This outcome reflects the negotiating directives agreed by the Council, which requested a 'substantial increase' in the funds."
"The EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States, as well as Greece, Portugal and Spain."
"Priority sectors include the environment, climate change and renewable energy, civil society, human and social development and the protection of cultural heritage."
"The funds earmarked for Norway will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States."
"Priority sectors include carbon capture and storage, green industry innovation, research and scholarship, human and social development, justice and home affairs, promotion of decent work and tripartite dialogue."
"Two protocols concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and for Norway for the period 2009-2014 provide for a renewal of the previous 2004-2009 protocols with unchanged concessions for Iceland and a relatively modest increase in concessions for Norway, on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit arrangement."
"I support the agreement between the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway concerning the continuation of the European Economic Area (EEA) financial mechanism, as we should all be working towards reducing the social and economic disparities within the EEA."
"The total package of EUR 1.8 billion represents an increase of 31% or 22% over the last five-year period."
"The extension of the protocols on fishery concessions and market access are important, long-term regulations in the field of aquaculture."
"Today, Parliament has voted in favour of the agreement proposed by the Commission regarding, on the one hand, financial mechanisms for the period 2009-2014 between the European Union and Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and Norway, and on the other hand, an agreement between the European Union and Norway."
"The agreements make provision for an increase in the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism for climate change and renewable energies, civil society, humanitarian and social development, and the protection of cultural heritage."
"In practical terms, it provides an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion."
"The last 12 States to join the Union, plus Spain, Greece and Portugal, are the countries that will be able to take advantage of these funds."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report, since I think that we should support economic cooperation and because we must never forget that the wellbeing of a Member State contributes to improving the economy of the whole of Europe, and thus the quality of life of its 500 million citizens."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal which gives an opportunity to strengthen the contribution of EEA and EFTA states to the reduction of economic and social disparities in the European Economic Area."
"In the meantime, fisheries concessions remain unchanged for Iceland and are modestly increased for Norway."
"These agreements provide for an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion, comprising a 31% increase in the European Economic Area (EEA) financial mechanism and a 22% increase in the Norwegian financial mechanism."
"It is worth pointing out that EEA funds should be channelled towards funding conservation, climate change and renewable energy, civil society, human and social development, and the protection of cultural heritage as priorities."
"Norway's financial resources will be channelled to priority sectors that involve carbon capture and storage, green-industry innovation, research and scholarship, human and social development, justice and home affairs, the promotion of decent work and tripartite dialogue."
"The two protocols concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway for the period 2009-2014 provide for the renewal of the previous 2004-2009 protocols with unchanged concessions for Iceland and a relatively modest increase in concessions for Norway, on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit agreement."
"This report gives a green light to the renewal of agreements relating to the European Economic Area (EEA)."
"Since the Agreement on the EEA entered into force in 1994, the EEA/European Free Trade Association states - currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - have contributed towards reducing economic and social disparities in the EEA."
"These contributions were always agreed for five-year periods, and the aim is now to renew the agreements for the 2009-2014 period."
"In parallel to those negotiations, but independently of them, negotiations were also launched on the basis of the two bilateral fish protocols with Iceland and Norway, and concluded on 18 December 2009."
"With regard to the outcome of the aforementioned negotiations, it is worth highlighting, in particular, the significant increase in the financial mechanism, although the position of Iceland is unchanged due to the severe crisis that it is experiencing."
"As regards the agreements concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway for the period 2009-2014, I share the favourable opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, which highlights the modest increase in concessions for Norway, on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit agreement, which expired on 30 April 2009."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"Since the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) entered into force in 1994, the EEA/European Free Trade Association states - currently Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - have contributed towards reducing economic and social disparities in the EEA."
"These contributions were always agreed for five-year periods, and now the agreements reached on the financial mechanisms for the 2009-2014 period are under discussion, along with the renewal of the two bilateral protocols on fisheries concessions with Iceland and Norway."
"No significant changes were made to these protocols against the previous period, with the concessions for Iceland remaining unchanged and those for Norway only increasing slightly."
"The agreements on the financial mechanisms resulted in a significant stepping up of the contribution from the EEA/EFTA states for the 2004-2009 period, envisaging an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion, which will be made available to the 12 newest Member States, as well as Greece, Portugal and Spain, in order to fund priority sectors including conservation, climate change, renewable energy, human and social development and protection of cultural heritage."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"in writing. - This proposal gives an opportunity to: strengthen the contribution of EEA and EFTA States to the reduction of economic and social disparities in the European Economic Area; significantly increase the financial mechanism against unchanged concessions for Iceland and modestly increase the concessions for Norway."
"I therefore suggested that the Committee on Fisheries give a favourable opinion on the Commission's proposal COM(2010)234."
"I supported this recommendation because it represents an opportunity to strengthen the contribution of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States in reducing economic and social disparities in the European Economic Area (EEA)."
"Fishing concessions for Iceland remain unchanged, while those for Norway have been increased slightly."
"The two agreements regarding the financial mechanisms for the period 2009-2014 between the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and the EU and Norway, provide an overall package of EUR 1.8 billion, with substantial increases compared with the period 2004-2009."
"Now we need to work to resolve the differences that still exist between the EU, Iceland and Norway over issues relating to the management of marine life, especially whale hunting."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this agreement which will strengthen the contribution of EEA-EFTA States in tackling social and economic disparities within the European Economic Area."
"I have voted in favour of the agreement because this is another logical step towards harmonising cooperation between the members of the European Free Trade Association."
"As vice-president of the delegation, I am very pleased that we are continuing in the direction of a privileged partnership."
"I am voting for this recommendation, as this horizontal agreement allows the removal of national restrictions on the current bilateral agreements between the Member States and Brazil, benefiting the entire European aviation industry."
"In addition, such an agreement enables the restoration of a sound legal basis for relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector, which will be an important step in strengthening EU-Brazil relations in this sector."
"I foresee that this agreement will generate benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to EUR 460 million, promote employment and offer new business opportunities for EU airlines."
"Since the European Union has exclusive competence for certain aspects of external aviation policy, it was necessary from a legal point of view to replace a dozen bilateral agreements concluded by Member States with the Federative Republic of Brazil by agreements negotiated and concluded by the European Union."
"Following approval by the Council of the European Union in 2003, the European Commission negotiated the agreement that I have decided to lend my support to today."
"The agreement will pave the way for 'a comprehensive air services agreement with Brazil based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence'."
"This future agreement will result in better services for travellers and a stronger position for European airlines."
"I think that the agreement on aviation relations between the European Union and Brazil provides a sound legal basis and marks an important first step in strengthening EU-Brazil aviation relations."
"I believe that this agreement will enable them to further enhance aviation cooperation and initiate negotiations on a global bilateral air services agreement."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation as it is an important step in strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector, and it will allow them to proceed towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement."
"The agreement that we adopted today is an important step in strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector."
"It is expected that this agreement could lead to benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to EUR 460 million, as well as promoting employment, and offering new business opportunities for EU airlines and benefits to those who travel between the EU and Brazil."
"Given the special ties that bind Portugal and Brazil, I welcome the conclusion of this agreement, which will engender a new closeness between Europe and Brazil, with all the economic, social and cultural benefits that this may bring."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, substantially changed the powers of various EU institutions, particularly Parliament, which, in the new set-up, is called upon to rule on matters which were not previously under its jurisdiction, as in this case of an international agreement between the EU and the Federative Republic of Brazil on air services."
"This agreement, which was concluded on 14 July 2010, is aimed at replacing the provisions contained in the bilateral agreements on air services between 12 Member States and the Federative Republic of Brazil with a bilateral agreement between the EU and the same."
"I support this agreement because it represents an important step in strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector."
"As with previous agreements covering the same area that have been recently adopted by Parliament, and given the specific context in which civil aviation operates, this proposal raises serious concerns about its scope and possible consequences."
"It concerns an issue with a clear impact on air transport companies, in a sector which is, for various reasons, strategic for safeguarding national interests."
"In the case of Brazil, this concern is even more pressing."
"The purpose behind it is clear, and the rapporteur does not make any effort to hide it: the aim is to open the market so as to create 'new business opportunities for EU airlines'."
"We know that the supposed creation of a level playing field for the various European companies contributes to the process of facilitating the monopolistic concentration of the sector, which is already under way, as well as the consequent reduction of the Member States' capacity to defend their flag-carrying airlines, and thus their legitimate interests, at a number of levels."
"'Free competition', which is constantly mentioned and seen as sacrosanct, is defended at all costs, and is once again the pillar by which this initiative is supported."
"The result for this sector is not substantially different from the result for others: the monopolistic concentration that always ends up being imposed in these cases."
"Together with my Italian colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I decided to abstain in today's vote regarding relations between the European Union and Brazil on certain aspects of air services."
"This is because, in the light of the content of the resolution on the Cesare Battisti case. I would have preferred it if the vote had been postponed ahead of the new decision of the Federal Court in Brazil on the extradition of Cesare Battisti, a criminal."
"Given the non-urgent nature of the dossier, postponing it to the next part-session or the one in April certainly would not have been a problem, especially if we think about the pain of the families of the victims of this mass-murderer."
"These same families have been waiting 31 years for justice to be done and for Cesare Battisti to serve the sentence handed down by Italy's justice system in our own prisons."
"I agreed with this report, because the EU has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation which were traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries."
"Consequently, on 5 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries in order to replace certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with EU agreements."
"The agreement was signed on 14 July 2010."
"It covers such aspects as safety, taxation of aviation fuel, competition rules, etc. Concluding this agreement has been an important first step in strengthening EU-Brazil aviation relations and has allowed Brazil and the EU to further enhance aviation cooperation and move towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement."
"This agreement is based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence."
"Such an agreement is expected to be capable of generating a consumer surplus (benefits in terms of lower fares) of up to EUR 460 million."
"It will have a positive employment effect and is expected to offer significant new business opportunities for EU airlines as well as benefits to the travelling public."
"in writing. - I voted for this Horizontal Agreement, which is not important in itself, but is an important step in strengthening EU-Brazil aviation relations, allowing Brazil and the EU to further enhance aviation cooperation and to move towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement between them."
"The comprehensive air agreement should be based on a combination of gradual market opening and on regulatory cooperation and convergence."
"The benefits to the EU will be more routes and lower fares for consumers."
"My abstention in the vote on the report regarding the agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on air services expresses a position that goes beyond the scope of the matter."
"I do not approve of the conduct of the Brazilian Government in the Cesare Battisti case."
"Extradition -procedures for which are defined in a bilateral agreement - should have been granted."
"The interpretation provided by the judicial authorities violates the commitments undertaken."
"The sentence -which Mr Battisti should serve in Italy - was handed down by an ordinary judge, applying ordinary laws to a common crime: mass murder."
"It is difficult to support international relations, such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament, with a country that does not respect agreements and which, above all, takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life."
"The EU has always advocated free competition."
"The mandate granted to the Commission on 15 October 2010 to negotiate a comprehensive air services agreement with Brazil based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence therefore makes perfect sense."
"This agreement gives all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to links with Brazil and replaces or complements the provisions of the current 14 bilateral air service agreements between the Member States and Brazil."
"This is an important first step in strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector, which has allowed them to continue to strengthen their cooperation at this level and proceed towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement between Brazil and the EU."
"All consumers benefit from this new agreement, which offers the possibility of lower fares on air transport to Brazil."
"I abstained on the recommendation tabled by Mrs Macovei, together with the two other reports, in the light of the conduct of the Brazilian authorities over the Cesare Battisti case."
"The failure to extradite a terrorist - who is not recognised as such by Brazil - has to be taken into consideration."
"For this reason, together with the rest of the Italian delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I decided to abstain on the draft decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visas for the purposes of business and tourism, as well as the report on the improvement of the agreements regarding air services between the EU and Brazil."
"Clearly, our actions are not an expression of our disagreement with the content of the reports, but a political signal through which, once again, we wanted to reiterate our disappointment regarding the conduct of the Brazilian authorities over the Cesare Battisti case."
"By voting for this report, we are giving the necessary favourable opinion of the European Parliament on the international agreement concluded between the EU and Brazil."
"It is a horizontal agreement with Brazil which will establish a solid legal basis for relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector."
"This is an important first step in strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector and will allow both parties to continue to strengthen their cooperation at this level and proceed towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement."
"It is thought that this agreement may generate benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to EUR 460 million."
"There will be a positive impact on employment, and it is hoped that new business opportunities will open up for EU airlines, with benefits for those who travel between the EU and Brazil."
"In view of this, I agree with the rapporteur on the proposal for Parliament to adopt this report and the request for the Council to finalise this procedure without undue delay."
"Given the important ties that bind Portugal and Brazil, I naturally welcome the adoption of this report."
"It will replace certain provisions contained in the 12 bilateral agreements on air services between the Member States and the Federative Republic of Brazil This agreement provides the foundation for strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector, and is expected to bring significant benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to EUR 460 million, as well as new business opportunities for EU airlines."
"in writing. - The horizontal agreement with Brazil will restore a sound legal basis for the EU's aviation relations with Brazil."
"This has been an important first step in strengthening EU-Brazil aviation relations which has allowed Brazil and the EU to further enhance aviation cooperation and move towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement between Brazil and the EU."
"Upon a request from the European Commission, on 15 October 2010, the EU Transport Council granted a mandate to the European Commission to negotiate a comprehensive air services agreement with Brazil based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence."
"Such an agreement is expected to be able to generate a consumer surplus (benefits in terms of lower fares) of up to EUR 460 million."
"It will have a positive employment effect and is expected to offer significant new business opportunities for EU airlines as well as benefits to the travelling public."
"in writing. - I have supported this agreement which will encourage further cooperation between the EU and Brazil in the field of civil aviation."
"The EU aviation industry will benefit from the removal of nationality restrictions between Member States and Brazil."
"Relations between the European Union and Brazil are greatly important in the current context of European external relations."
"This agreement, which I believe to be the first step of many towards a new EU civil aviation policy with Brazil, is to establish the general framework for developing relations in this field."
"It is called a horizontal agreement because it creates a solid legal basis for a number of aspects of civil aviation between the two parties, by replacing the traditional bilateral agreements with provisions for general and uniform implementation across the entire EU territory provided for in this agreement."
"The draft recommendation, for which I was the shadow rapporteur, welcomes the terms of the agreement, which addresses such important issues as security and imposing taxes on fuel for general implementation throughout European territory, and the requirement to comply with EU competition laws."
"I believe that the agreement will pave the way for new economic benefits, be they for consumers or airlines, and strengthen cooperation relations between both transatlantic parties, thus constituting an asset for the EU."
"For the above reasons, I voted in favour of the document."
"With regard to the draft Council decision (07853/2010), the draft agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the External Border Fund for the period 2007-2013, and to the request for consent submitted by the Council in line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, within the legal framework and according to a recommendation made by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I support the conclusion of this agreement."
"I support the agreement between the European Community and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013."
"The countries involved in the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis should participate in the External Borders Fund, in line the decision establishing this fund."
"This agreement should therefore provide for the implementation of standards in the territories of the countries involved, so as to allow the Commission to take ultimate responsibility for implementing the budget of the fund in these states."
"It takes into account aspects at the level of financial management and control of the fund and also establishes the provisions concerning financial contributions from these countries to the fund's budget."
"I would also stress the choice that Liechtenstein has made, through a joint declaration, not to participate in the fund, although this does not affect its obligation to contribute financially to it, since it was established to share the burden and provide financial support for the implementation of the Schengen acquis in the field of external border and visa policy."
"The proposal relates to the conclusion, on behalf of the EU, of an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein."
"Broadly speaking, this agreement concerns the participation of these countries in the External Borders Fund, arising from their participation in the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis."
"It is envisaged that further agreements will be concluded, setting out the necessary provisions for the implementation of this participation, in particular, those ensuring the protection of the EU's financial interests and those that allow the Court of Auditors to supervise the whole process."
"The final adoption of the agreement by the Council will follow Parliament's vote in favour."
"This recommendation relates to a draft Council decision on the establishment of an agreement between the EU and the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013."
"Given that this agreement falls within the objectives that led to the signing of the Schengen Treaty on the free movement of people and goods, given the agreements that have previously been established between the EU and the aforementioned countries in relation to the objectives set out in the Schengen Treaty, and given that the EU has created an External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013 under the general programme entitled 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows', I welcome the conclusion of this agreement, which will help to strengthen cohesion within Europe."
"This report follows the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013."
"It is connected to existing agreements or those which are still being implemented on the movement and freedom of people between these states and EU countries."
"Thus, with the aim of supporting the monitoring of external borders, particularly in the field of immigration, the EU wants to assign, under certain conditions, Union support from the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013."
"The objectives of the actions taken in this respect by the EU and the Commission deserve our criticism, since we cannot ignore the unacceptable Return Directive."
"As Chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Switzerland, Iceland and Norway and the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the European Economic Area, I welcome this report."
"in writing. - I voted for this agreement which allows states associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen Agreement to participate in the External Borders Fund for the 2007 to 2013 period."
"Looking from the point of view of a true European Union - in political, economic and, above all, geographic terms - I think it is necessary and fundamentally important to vote in favour of this proposal, since countries like Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, as well as Switzerland, are geographically located in Europe."
"I therefore think that a single border management policy should be implemented in order to facilitate integration and movement from one country to another."
"Establishing a European border management fund would be a just and significant measure in order to bring about centralised coordination, both in terms of resources and of implementing policies."
"This would also facilitate and stimulate tourism and the free movement of transport and people."
"Under the new powers granted to Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, it has become necessary to adopt the draft Council decision on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Union, of the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the External Border Fund for the period 2007-2013."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has recommended the adoption of this agreement."
"The agreement envisages the participation in the External Borders Fund of third countries involved in the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis."
"This participation can come about through further agreements which should be reached in order to clarify the necessary provisions for this participation, including provisions on the protection of the EU's financial interests and the authorisation of the Court of Auditors to carry out the audit."
"The agreement was reached between the parties, and given that there were no critical comments in any of the opinions expressed, I voted in favour of this resolution."
"In line with Decision (EC) No 574/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013, third countries involved in the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis should participate in this fund."
"To this end, it is envisaged that agreements will be concluded specifying supplementary rules that are necessary for this participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the EU's financial interests and the exercise of the power to audit by the Court of Auditors."
"This proposal relates to the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein, the precise aim of which is the definition of supplementary rules on the participation of these countries in the aforementioned fund."
"I believe that this merits my support, in line with the recommendation of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"in writing. - In line with our position during the vote in the LIBE Committee (the lead committee), we in the Verts/ALE Group decided to vote against this proposal."
"I have voted in favour of the agreement, because these states are not a problem in terms of quality or reliability and, therefore, do not represent a security risk for the EU."
"The recommendation concerns the conclusion of an agreement with Schengen-associated third countries, in this case, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein."
"They are to be involved in implementing, applying and developing the Schengen acquis."
"Supplementary regulations are needed in this respect to protect the financial interests of the EU and to give auditing powers to the Court of Auditors."
"These additions are sensible, which is why I have voted in favour of concluding the agreement."
"I am voting for this report, given that the Schengen area already allows free movement within a territory of 42 673 km of external sea borders and 7 721 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million people."
"The gradual expansion of this area has allowed third countries that have special relationships with the EU to take part in Schengen cooperation, and for the Swiss Confederation to belong to the Schengen acquis from 1 March 2008."
"Given the open borders policy between Switzerland and the Principality of Liechtenstein, a microstate that has been steadily integrating into the European trade area since its accession to the European Economic Area in 1995, given that it has already implemented 98.4% of EU directives into domestic law, and given that it is part of the Single Market, there is no reason for me to oppose its accession to the Schengen area."
"A microstate located between Switzerland and Austria, Liechtenstein has an area of 160 km² and a population of 35 000."
"Although the country is not a member of the European Union, it is associated to it within the European Economic Area (EEA)."
"It applies almost all European legislation and has asked to join the Schengen area for the free movement of persons."
"Given the tradition of cooperation between the European Union and Liechtenstein and the absence of any threat linked to the country's accession to the Schengen area, I voted in favour of it joining."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation, according to which the signature of the protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis took place on 28 February 2008."
"Switzerland joined the Schengen area alone, on 12 December 2008, with the abolition of border control at land borders, followed by the abolition of border checks on intra-Schengen flights at airports on 29 March 2009."
"For the first time, it was necessary to put up controls at a place where there has been no real border for 100 years."
"The 41 kilometres that separate the two countries became an external Schengen border."
"In 2007, the European Parliament was asked for the first time to give its opinion regarding the conclusion of this protocol."
"Following a request by the designated rapporteur at that time - Mrs Ewa Klamt - on 11 June 2007, the Legal Affairs Committee gave its unanimous opinion, recommending that the legal basis should be changed so far as to refer to the second paragraph of Article 300(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which requires the assent and not merely consultation of the European Parliament."
"I welcome the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Parliament to be more closely informed about international agreements."
"Twenty five years ago, five Member States decided to abolish the domestic borders between them and create a single external border."
"At present, all the Member States are full members of Schengen, with the exception of the United Kingdom, Ireland, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania."
"There are also three associated states integrated: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland;"
"Liechtenstein should become the fourth."
"It was hoped that Liechtenstein would become associated with Schengen at the same time as Switzerland, in 2008."
"However, the process did not occur as expected, in particular, due to the reservations expressed by two Member States, Germany and Sweden, concerning issues related to tax evasion."
"The accession of Switzerland alone made it necessary to introduce controls in areas where, for more than a hundred years, there had been no real border, and the 41 km separating Switzerland and Liechtenstein became an external border."
"In view of the new rules of the Treaty of Lisbon, which allow Parliament to be associated with the conclusion of international agreements in a much closer way, as well as the fact that the reservations existing in the Council have been lifted, I propose that Parliament gives its consent to the conclusion of this protocol, and I hope that Liechtenstein can join Schengen as soon as possible."
"I voted for this report as I think that it is necessary and natural to remove border controls with Liechtenstein, given both the size of this state and its relations with its neighbours, Austria and Switzerland, with which it enjoys a tradition of free movement. In addition, Liechtenstein's effective association with the Schengen and Dublin acquis will happen naturally as this country has already implemented a large amount of EU legislation and uses the same infrastructure for accessing SIS and VIS as Switzerland, a country which is already part of the Schengen area."
"Given the open borders policy between the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Swiss Confederation, it was expected that the countries would join Schengen at the same time."
"However, this did not happen."
"Switzerland joined the Schengen area alone, on 12 December 2008."
"However, there was already provision in the agreement on the accession of Switzerland for Liechtenstein's possible accession by means of a protocol, which is now being approved by Parliament."
"This accession made it necessary to put in place border controls for the first time between Liechtenstein and Switzerland at places where there had been no real border for a century."
"This recommendation advises Parliament to approve the establishment of a protocol between the European Union, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on Switzerland's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which was concluded on 28 February 2008."
"The Schengen Agreement aims to create a territory where there is free movement of people and goods, without internal borders between the states, but only a single external border."
"Following the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999, the EU integrated the Schengen cooperation into the framework of its legal powers."
"For decades, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Swiss Confederation have practised an open borders policy with free movement of people."
"Switzerland's accession to the Schengen area in 2008 created a problem for movement between the two states, transforming the border between them into an external one, and the aim is now to resolve this problem."
"Thus, in view of the advantages that arise from the entry into force of this protocol, there is nothing to prevent its adoption."
"The Schengen Agreement dates back to 1985, when it was concluded between Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands."
"The agreement and the subsequent convention adopted in 1990 are aimed at abolishing systematic controls on common borders and introducing a system where people can move freely."
"The Schengen Convention abolished checks at the internal borders of the signatory states and created a single external border with common rules on external border controls, a common visa policy, police and judicial cooperation and the establishment of the Schengen Information System (SIS)."
"The Schengen area currently comprises 25 Schengen Member States: the EU Member States of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, as well as the three associated non-EU countries - Norway, Iceland and Switzerland."
"At present, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus only partially apply the Schengen acquis and checks are therefore still carried out at their borders."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Coelho report."
"Whilst Scotland is not a part of the Schengen area, we do opt in to certain parts of the Schengen acquis."
"The Scottish Government has been actively involved in this area at Council level and I am happy to support that work."
"I voted in favour of the recommendation, according to which the signature of the protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the EU Agreement on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis took place on 28 February 2008."
"Switzerland joined the Schengen area alone, on 12 December 2008, with the abolition of border control at land borders, followed by the abolition of border checks on intra-Schengen flights at airports on 29 March 2009."
"For the first time, it was necessary to put up controls at a place where there has been no real border for 100 years."
"The 41 kilometres that separate the two countries became an external Schengen border."
"I welcome the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon allowing the European Parliament to be more closely informed about international agreements."
"The gradual expansion of the Schengen area has led third countries that have particular relations with the EU to take part in Schengen cooperation."
"The precondition for association with the Schengen acquis by non-EU countries is an agreement on free movement of persons between those states and the EU."
"For these countries, this participation involves the following: being included in the area without checks at internal borders; applying the provisions of the Schengen acquis and of all Schengen-relevant texts adopted pursuant to it; being involved in decisions relating to Schengen-relevant texts."
"A protocol was signed in 2008 for the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and Switzerland."
"This resulted in the requirement of said principality to implement, apply and develop the Schengen acquis."
"Yet, despite having become a member of the European Economic Area as early as 1995 and having progressively brought itself into line with European laws by transposing many directives into domestic law, the Principality of Liechtenstein had not yet begun negotiations for accession to the Schengen agreements."
"Through this agreement - which I supported - the rights and duties of both parties have been established, thereby permitting the free movement of persons."
"Furthermore, a series of implementation rules have been introduced for the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon dealing with international agreements, so as to give the European Parliament a more assertive role in terms of their communication and adoption."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"Liechtenstein is a doubly landlocked Alpine microstate in Western Europe, bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and by Austria to the east."
"It has an area of 160 km2, an estimated population of 35 000 and has the highest gross domestic product per person in the world."
"Liechtenstein has been steadily integrating into the European trade area since its accession to the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1995."
"The jurisdiction has now implemented 98.4% of EU directives into domestic law."
"Liechtenstein is also part of the Single Market, in which the same basic rules apply to all participating states."
"The accession of new countries to the Schengen Information System (SIS) is essential for achieving a Europe without borders."
"Liechtenstein has been part of the European Economic Area since 1995 and has been steadily integrating into the European trade area."
"It has been subject to various evaluation procedures, in particular, on matters of data protection, the SIS, air, land and sea borders, police cooperation and visa policy."
"By acceding to this agreement, Liechtenstein will become part of the Schengen acquis."
"The Schengen Agreement was concluded on 14 June 1985 between Germany, Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands."
"Schengen cooperation is now integrated into the European Union legal and institutional framework and comprises 25 Schengen Member States, along with three countries that are associated with the EEA: Norway, Iceland and Switzerland."
"Switzerland joined the Schengen area alone on 12 December 2008, with the abolition of border controls at land borders, followed by the abolition of border controls on intra-Schengen flights at airports on 29 March 2009."
"Since Liechtenstein did not accede, and there is a very active policy of free movement between these two countries, for the first time, it was necessary to put up controls at places where there had been no real border for 100 years."
"The 41 km that separate the two countries became an external Schengen border."
"This agreement removes that barrier through the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to Schengen."
"I welcome the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, enabling Parliament to have an active role in adopting these agreements."
"For all of the above reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"The agreement on the Swiss Confederation's accession to the Schengen acquis, which has been in force since 1 March 2008, explicitly anticipated Liechtenstein's possible accession by means of a protocol."
"Given the open borders policy which has existed for decades between the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Swiss Confederation, it was expected that both countries would join the Schengen area at the same time."
"In fact, this did not happen, with Switzerland joining the Schengen acquis alone on 12 December 2008."
"This ultimately made it necessary to put in place controls at places where there had been no real border for 100 years."
"In order to overcome this barrier, and given that Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area and the Single Market, I have supported the conclusion of this protocol in the expectation that Liechtenstein's accession to the Schengen acquis can now finally be achieved."
"in writing. - In 2007, Parliament was asked to give its opinion regarding the conclusion of this protocol for the first time."
"Following a request from the rapporteur at that time, Ms Klamt, the Legal Affairs Committee issued a unanimous opinion, on 11 June 2007, recommending that the legal basis should be changed so as to refer to the second subparagraph of Article 300(3) of the EC Treaty (the proposals for Council decisions set out to modify the 'specific institutional framework' provided for in the main agreement, of which the proposed protocol forms an integral part), which requires the assent and not merely consultation of the European Parliament."
"For that reason, and with the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this report was referred back to the LIBE Committee."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation because I think it can contribute to the entry into force, implementation and development of the Schengen acquis in countries such as Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein."
"It is indeed important for these countries to participate in the External Borders Fund for the period 2007-2013, in accordance with current measures and agreements."
"In order to bring about an ever more united Europe that does not, however, lose sight of practicality, their participation will be regulated by supplementary rules that will also ensure the protection of the European Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors."
"I have voted in favour of the agreement concerning the accession of Liechtenstein to the agreement on the Schengen acquis, because this is a logical step forward which will not present us with any problems."
"We can expect the agreement to function smoothly."
"I am voting for this recommendation in view of the fact that the agreement concluded on 26 October 2004 with the Swiss Federation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol."
"Given the open borders policy between the two countries and the fact that in 2001, Liechtenstein expressed its interest in acceding to the agreement, but that this did not happen owing to differences between the Council and Parliament, which were resolved in the Treaty of Lisbon, there is no reason for me to oppose the conclusion of this agreement."
"I voted in favour of this document, which states that the agreement of 26 October 2004 concluded with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland (the 'Dublin agreement with Switzerland') provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol."
"On 27 February 2006, the Council gave the Commission the relevant authorisation to enter into negotiations with Liechtenstein and Switzerland."
"Following the negotiations, the draft protocol on Liechtenstein's accession to the Dublin agreement with Switzerland was presented."
"The legal basis for the Commission's proposal of 4 December 2006 for a protocol on the association of Liechtenstein was Article 300(3), first subparagraph, of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which provided for consultation of Parliament."
"I welcome the renewed referral to Parliament of the draft Council decision and thus, the continuation of the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland."
"The consent of Parliament must be obtained, as it called for at first reading, in order to conclude this protocol with Liechtenstein."
"In the light of the successfully concluded negotiations with Liechtenstein and the amended legal basis, consent should be given to the conclusion of the protocol."
"The agreement on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland - the Dublin/Eurodac agreement - was concluded in 2004."
"Given that an open borders policy for the free movement of people had existed for decades between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the association of the latter country with those negotiations would have been logical."
"Although it expressed its interest, Liechtenstein was left out, since it had not yet concluded a savings taxation agreement with the European Community."
"In view of the new rules of the Treaty of Lisbon, which allow Parliament to be associated with the conclusion of international agreements in a much closer way, as well as the fact that Liechtenstein has concluded the agreement in question, which has been in force since 1 July 2005, I support Parliament's decision to give its consent to the conclusion of this protocol."
"An agreement on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State was concluded with Switzerland in 2004."
"This agreement provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein by means of a protocol."
"On 27 February 2006, the Council gave the Commission the relevant authorisation to enter into negotiations with Liechtenstein and Switzerland."
"On 21 June 2006, negotiations were finalised and the draft protocol on Liechtenstein's accession to the Dublin agreement with Switzerland was initialled."
"Now it is up to Parliament to give its approval to the conclusion of this protocol."
"I believe that this should happen, so I am voting in favour of this recommendation."
"The Council has submitted a draft protocol between the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the Principality of Liechtenstein's accession to the agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland."
"I welcome the adoption of this protocol, which involves the European Union and two states that have a history of good neighbourly relations and free movement of people."
"I agree with the conclusions presented by the rapporteur, and I welcome, in particular, the continuation of negotiations on the association of the Principality of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland, and I hope that it will be concluded quickly."
"These are issues related to the right to asylum and the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland."
"The agreement concluded on 26 October 2004 with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland - the Dublin agreement with Switzerland - provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with this acquis."
"Given that an open borders policy for the free movement of people had existed for decades between Liechtenstein and Switzerland, in 2001, Liechtenstein expressed its interest in joining the Dublin agreement with Switzerland."
"However, it was not associated with the negotiations with Switzerland as it had not concluded a savings taxation agreement with the EU."
"Following the subsequent conclusion and entry into force of this agreement between the EU and Liechtenstein, the latter country confirmed its wish to be associated with the Dublin acquis in 2005."
"In 2006, the Council gave the Commission the relevant authorisation to enter into negotiations with Liechtenstein and Switzerland."
"The negotiations were concluded and the draft protocol was initialled."
"I voted in favour of this document, which states that the agreement of 2004 concluded with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland (the 'Dublin agreement with Switzerland') provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol."
"I welcome the renewed referral to Parliament of the draft Council decision and thus, the continuation of the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland."
"In the light of the successfully concluded negotiations with Liechtenstein and the amended legal basis, consent should be given to the conclusion of the protocol."
"I voted in favour of the recommendation to the Commission concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State, in Switzerland and - if the protocol is ratified, as the majority of the European Parliament hopes - in the Principality of Liechtenstein as well."
"The purpose of the Dublin agreement is to equip the participating states with criteria designed to establish which state is responsible for examining a request for asylum, thereby ensuring better treatment for applicants and, at the same time, providing the states with tools to fight organised crime."
"The importance of these issues -namely, the protection of refugees and international security - requires a careful and constant effort from all European institutions so that refugees or asylum seekers can rely on clear legal and regulatory criteria and references."
"in writing. - I welcome the renewed referral to Parliament of the draft Council decision and thus, the continuation of the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland."
"The consent of Parliament must be obtained - as it called for at first reading - in order to conclude this protocol with Liechtenstein."
"I support the conclusion of the protocol."
"In the light of the successfully concluded negotiations with Liechtenstein and the amended legal basis, I voted for consent to be given."
"I welcome the fact that Parliament has been consulted again on the draft Council decision and that the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland will therefore proceed."
"In accordance with the wishes expressed by Parliament at the first reading, Parliament's approval is necessary for the conclusion of this protocol with Liechtenstein."
"Given the link that already exists between Liechtenstein and the EU, I believe that the conclusion of the protocol is important, with the relevant amendments to the legal basis."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The agreement concluded on 26 October 2004 with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland, known as the Dublin agreement with Switzerland, provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol."
"In fact, the decades-long existence of an open borders policy for the free movement of people between Liechtenstein and Switzerland led Liechtenstein to once again express its interest in joining the Dublin agreement with Switzerland in 2005."
"The final conclusion of the agreement has not happened before now for various reasons: firstly, because other agreements under negotiation with Liechtenstein had not been concluded; secondly, because there was a dispute on the legal basis, and later because of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"At last, Parliament's objectives are met when it is heard to give a favourable opinion, instead of simply being consulted."
"I welcome this fact and am voting in favour of the present report."
"The agreement concluded on 26 October 2004 with the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland, the Dublin agreement, provides for the possible association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin acquis by means of a protocol."
"Given that for decades, there was an open borders policy for the free movement of people between Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the latter country expressed its interest in 2001 in acceding to the Dublin agreement with Switzerland, but was not associated with the negotiations because a savings taxation agreement had not been concluded with the European Community."
"Following the subsequent conclusion and entry into force of this agreement between the European Community and Liechtenstein, on 10 June 2005, the latter country confirmed its wish to be associated with the Dublin acquis."
"The Council's objections with regard to the legal basis have been overcome and Parliamentary approval has become necessary, so I believe that all the conditions for consent to this protocol with Liechtenstein have been met."
"in writing. - Although the rapporteur welcomes the renewed referral to Parliament of the draft Council decision and thus, the continuation of the negotiations on the association of Liechtenstein with the Dublin agreement with Switzerland, and calls for the consent of Parliament, the Verts/ALE Group decided not to follow that advice."
"We therefore voted against the proposal, as we did in the LIBE Committee."
"I voted in favour of this report because I support the conclusion of the protocol for the accession of Liechtenstein to the Dublin agreement with Switzerland."
"This agreement has already enabled Switzerland to make use of important instruments in the fight against international crime and illegal immigration."
"That is not all. By establishing this kind of coordination, multiple and unwarranted asylum applications can be prevented."
"Now, the aim is to enable Liechtenstein to enjoy these same benefits, bringing it ever closer to the final objective of full accession to the European Union."
"I was pleased to be able to vote in favour of the accession of Liechtenstein to the agreement on the EU asylum system."
"This will prevent multiple asylum applications from being made in the EU and in Liechtenstein."
"If an asylum application is rejected in Liechtenstein, it will also be rejected in the EU and vice versa."
"At the same time as simplifying the procedure, we have also achieved further harmonisation."
"in writing. - (PT) I am voting for this recommendation, given that the current EU-Brazil agreement grants a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business to all Brazilian and EU citizens, including the nationals of the four Member States not enjoying visa-free travel to Brazil at present."
"As the agreement supplements, rather than replacing, the existing agreements between several Member States and Brazil, which cover travel for purposes other than tourism and business or paid activity, there is no reason why it should not be concluded."
"The length of stay in the Schengen area has been limited to three months during any six-month period, so this does not raise any concerns about Brazilian citizens taking up illegal residence."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports."
"This EU-Brazil agreement gives a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business, as defined in the agreement, for all Brazilian and EU citizens, including the nationals of the four Member States - Estonia, Latvia, Cyprus and Malta - not enjoying visa-free travel to Brazil at present."
"It should be noted that, due to the common visa policy and the exclusive competence of the European Union in this area, only the Union can negotiate and conclude a visa waiver agreement, and not the individual Member States."
"Importantly, in order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Brazil may only suspend or terminate it in respect of all the EU Member States."
"Reciprocally, the Union may also suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all its Member States."
"I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that we must ensure the implementation of the principle of reciprocity in EU visa policy."
"In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, Brazilian nationals can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa for short stays."
"Brazil, however, still requires a visa from the nationals of four Member States (Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia) to enter its territory."
"The other Member States have bilateral visa agreements with Brazil, allowing their nationals to enter Brazil for short stays without a visa."
"Due to the exclusive external competence of the European Union in this area, only it can negotiate and conclude a visa waiver agreement, and not the individual Member States."
"Therefore, on 18 April 2008, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations on the conclusion of a short-stay visa waiver agreement between the European Union and Brazil."
"Following the negotiations, the agreement was initialled and the formal signature on behalf of the Union and Brazil took place in Brussels on 8 November 2010."
"I consider it essential to approve the conclusion of this visa waiver agreement, so that all EU citizens, including those of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, can travel without a visa to Brazil for purposes of tourism and business, in the same way in which citizens of Brazil can already travel visa-free to all EU Member States."
"We need to enforce the common EU visa policy without delay."
"Although Brazilian citizens can travel to all EU Member States without having to obtain a visa, in the case of a short stay, there are, however, four EU Member States - Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia - whose citizens require a visa in order to enter Brazilian territory."
"Although all the other Member States have negotiated bilateral agreements with Brazil so as to ensure a short-stay visa waiver, at present, however, it is no longer possible for the Member States to conclude this type of agreement on an individual basis."
"Thus, the EU has an exclusive external remit in the field of the common visa policy."
"On 8 November 2010, an agreement was therefore concluded between the EU and Brazil, granting a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business for all Brazilian and EU citizens."
"I support the fact that this agreement thus ensures equal treatment for all EU citizens, ensuring that it can only be suspended or terminated, whether by Brazil or by the EU, if it is applied to all its Member States."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation as it safeguards equal treatment of all European citizens under the common visa policy between the EU and Brazil."
"The agreement does not replace but supplements the existing bilateral agreements, which cover travel for purposes other than tourism or business."
"During the last Portuguese Presidency, the European Union established a special strategic partnership with Brazil."
"In the spirit which should preside over this similar agreement, all measures which remove obstacles to contact between European citizens and those of this other Portuguese-speaking country are obviously to be welcomed."
"Since four European countries still do not enjoy the same waiver, I believe that there is every advantage in extending the same scheme to them and thus evaluating the agreement that is proposed to us now in a positive way."
"With regard to EU-Brazil relations, it should be remembered that the strategic importance of this country has long justified the establishment of a specific delegation, as already happens with the other countries making up the quartet of Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as with countries that are objectively less important in the international arena."
"in writing. - (PT) Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, Brazilian citizens can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa, provided that this is for short stays."
"However, not everyone from the European Union has the same privileges."
"Nationals of the following countries find themselves in this situation: Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia."
"This means that the 'reciprocity principle' is not being respected."
"In order for these citizens to be on an equal footing with the other inhabitants of the EU and Brazil, it is necessary to establish an agreement between the EU and Brazil."
"We cannot have a two-speed EU, so I welcome the adoption of this agreement, not only because it seems inherently fair, but also because it puts an end to one of the few cases of negative discrimination that still exists between people in the EU."
"Together with my Italian colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I decided to abstain in today's vote regarding relations between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports."
"This is because, in the light of the content of the resolution on the Cesare Battisti case, I would have preferred it if the vote had been postponed ahead of the new decision of the Federal Court in Brazil on the extradition of Cesare Battisti, a criminal."
"Given the non-urgent nature of the dossier, postponing it to the next part-session or the one in April certainly would not have been a problem, especially if we think about the pain of the families of the victims of this mass-murderer."
"These same families have been waiting 31 years for justice to be done and for Cesare Battisti to serve the sentence handed down by Italy's justice system in our own prisons."
"This matter concerns the extension of a common passport to EU countries that are still subject to short-stay waivers."
"The report is in favour of approving the conclusion of this agreement on visa exemption as soon as possible, in order that all EU citizens, including citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, can travel to Brazil for tourism and business purposes, just as Brazilian citizens can already travel without a visa to all EU Member States."
"This is about implementing the visa reciprocity policy."
"Parliament believes that it should proceed with visa reciprocity until all its citizens from all the Member States can enter, without a visa, all the countries whose citizens can already travel to the EU without a visa, including the US and Canada."
"We believe this to be fair."
"in writing. - The European airline industry and its customers have not had an easy ride over the last few months!"
"The infamous volcanic ash crisis occurred precisely when the airlines, and its passengers of course, were coping with the effects of a very difficult recession."
"However, in the midst of these challenges comes some good news for business and passengers alike!"
"Today's vote on the EU-Brazil Air Service Agreement brings significant mutual benefits."
"Firstly, Brazil is a very strategically important partner for the EU with an enormous potential future market."
"Currently, more than four million passengers per year fly between Brazil and the EU. A country with a rapidly developing tourism sector, this number can only rise."
"From a business perspective, Sao Paolo is the financial capital of South America."
"The development of the highly specialised oil and financial industry will lead to greater demand for air travel."
"The main achievement of this is the removal of nationality restrictions in the existing bilateral agreements between Member States and Brazil."
"This is an extremely important first step in strengthening EU-Brazil aviation relations which has allowed Brazil and the EU to move towards negotiating a comprehensive air transport agreement."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170)"
"I abstained in the final vote on the report by Mrs Macovei, as I also did on the reports by Mrs Ţicău and Mr Enciu, in order to express my disappointment in the conduct of the Brazilian Government over the extradition of the terrorist, Cesare Battisti."
"The agreements on visa waivers and air services confirm the good relations between Brazil and the European Union."
"During the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), I asked that we might hear from the Brazilian Ambassador to the European Union in order to discuss some fundamental issues such as the respect of human rights, the fight against terrorism, and views on freedom and security in Europe and Brazil."
"I feel confident that we can achieve tangible results for both European citizens and the people of Brazil."
"I voted in favour of this resolution on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports."
"In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, Brazilian nationals can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa for short stays."
"Brazil, however, still requires a visa from the nationals of four Member States (Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia) to enter its territory."
"The other Member States have bilateral visa agreements with Brazil, allowing their nationals to enter Brazil for short stays without a visa."
"Due to the common visa policy and the exclusive competence of the European Union in this area, only the Union can negotiate and conclude a visa waiver agreement, and not the individual Member States."
"It is essential to approve the conclusion of this visa waiver agreement, so that all EU citizens, including those of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, can travel without a visa to Brazil for purposes of tourism and business, in the same way in which citizens of Brazil can already travel visa-free to all EU Member States."
"We need to take measures in this area without delay."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Parliament consenting to the conclusion of this visa waiver agreement as soon as possible, so that all EU citizens, including those of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, can travel without a visa to Brazil for purposes of tourism and business, in the same way that citizens of Brazil can already travel visa-free to all EU Member States."
"We need to enforce the EU's visa reciprocity policy without delay."
"My abstention in the vote on the report regarding the agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-term visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports expresses a position that goes beyond the scope of the matter."
"I do not approve of the conduct of the Brazilian Government in the Cesare Battisti case."
"Extradition -procedures for which are defined in a bilateral agreement - should have been granted."
"The interpretation provided by the judicial authorities violates the commitments undertaken."
"The sentence -which Mr Battisti should serve in Italy - was handed down by an ordinary judge, applying ordinary laws to a common crime: mass murder."
"It is difficult to support international relations, such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament, with a country that does not respect agreements and which, above all, takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life."
"in writing. - (PT) All European Union citizens who want to travel to Brazil for tourism and business purposes will not require a visa for stays of up to three months, just as Brazilian citizens can already travel without a visa to all EU countries, in line with the agreement that has just been adopted by Parliament."
"This agreement will mainly benefit citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, who still need a visa to enter Brazil."
"This agreement affects holders of ordinary passports."
"Following the adoption of this agreement, all EU citizens - including citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, for whom Brazil continued to require a visa - will be able to enter the country without a visa for tourism and business purposes, just as Brazilian citizens can already travel to all EU Member States without a visa."
"The length of stay in the Schengen area is limited to three months during any six-month period."
"This agreement will cover about 90-95% of all travellers."
"in writing. - I voted in favour because I consider it essential to help Brazilian people to settle the huge territories."
"Technological and financial aid will ensure food competitiveness and low prices."
"Brazil can turn from an agricultural producer into a great consumer of European goods, open a new sales market and widen its tourist services if support is given in the right areas."
"in writing. - (PT) Brazilian citizens can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa, provided that this is for short stays, under the terms of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001."
"However, Brazil still requires a visa in order for citizens from four EU Member States to enter its territory: Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia."
"The other Member States have concluded bilateral agreements directly with Brazil."
"In order to address this, and given the exclusive external remit of the EU in this area, the Council has adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations for the conclusion of a short-stay visa waiver agreement between the EU and Brazil."
"The current EU-Brazil agreement, for which I voted, grants a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business to all Brazilian and EU citizens, including the nationals of the four Member States that do not enjoy visa-free travel to Brazil at present."
"The agreement does not replace but supplements the existing bilateral agreements between several Member States and Brazil, which cover travel for purposes other than tourism or business, such as for students and researchers."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the conclusion of the EU-Brazil agreement on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports in order to guarantee that, in line with the requirements of the principle of reciprocity and the principle of equality of treatment, all EU citizens - including citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, who, until now, have continued to need a visa to enter Brazilian territory - can travel to Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes, just as citizens of Brazil can already travel to EU Member States without a visa."
"in writing. - The present EU-Brazil agreement gives a reciprocal visa waiver for travel for the purpose of tourism and business, as defined in the agreement, for all Brazilian and EU citizens, including the nationals of the four Member States not enjoying visa-free travel to Brazil at present."
"The agreement does not replace but supplements existing bilateral agreements between several EU Member States and Brazil, and which cover travel for purposes other than tourism and business (e.g. students and researchers)."
"The category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity is also excluded from the scope of this agreement."
"In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Brazil may suspend or terminate it only in respect of all the EU Member States."
"Reciprocally, the Union may also suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all its Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) The Treaty of Lisbon established that the conclusion of agreements on the common policy on visas with third countries is the exclusive remit of the EU."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 already allows Brazilian citizens to travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa."
"However, Brazil has continued to require a visa in order for citizens from Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia, EU Member States, to enter its territory."
"This reciprocal visa waiver agreement is aimed at travel for the purpose of tourism or business, which will bring economic advantages for both parties."
"The length of stay in the Schengen area is limited to three months during any six-month period."
"I believe that it is important to stress that this agreement takes into account the Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis, namely Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, granting visa-free access to Brazilian nationals for a period of three months in the territory of every Member State, independently of the period for the whole Schengen area."
"I am voting in favour of this agreement as I believe that it is essential to avoid discrimination between citizens of different Member States, and to properly implement the reciprocity principle, which is one of the European Union's guiding principles."
"I welcomed the results of the vote."
"It is my firm belief that every measure which means that the citizens of all the EU Member States enjoy equal rights deserves our support."
"I am all the more pleased because these equal rights relate to key matters such as the freedom to cross borders."
"As a Pole, I remember the numerous difficulties involved in crossing the border before Poland became a member of the European Union, and so I regard every step we take towards the full and mutual abolition of visas as being of huge significance."
"The Macovei recommendation is also significant for another reason."
"In the explanatory statement, the rapporteur notes that two third countries, namely Canada and the United States, are still imposing visa obligations; on three Member States in the case of Canada, and on four Member States in the case of the United States."
"I believe that the measures taken recently by Parliament, such as Written Declaration 89/2010, will have the intended effect and bring about a change in the visa policies of the United States and Canada."
"I am voting for this recommendation because, under Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, Brazil is not included in the list of countries whose citizens can cross the external borders of the EU without a visa. However, four Member States still do not benefit from the reciprocity that has been implemented."
"Since the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon imply that the common policy on visas with third countries is now the exclusive remit of the EU, all the Member States will benefit from the visa waiver with Brazil."
"In addition, the existing bilateral agreements between the Member States and Brazil are still ensured, as they include some categories of passengers that are not covered by the EU-Brazil agreement."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's position in stating that this agreement should serve as an example for reciprocity with other countries, namely, the US and Canada."
"This agreement gives reciprocal access to short-stay, visa-free travel for all EU and Brazilian citizens holding a diplomatic, service or official passport."
"To ensure equal treatment of all EU citizens as regards visa-free travel, Article 8 of the agreement provides that Brazil can suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all Member States of the Union and, reciprocally, the EU may suspend or terminate the agreement only with respect to all Member States."
"The agreement provides for the establishment of a committee of experts to settle disputes that may arise from the interpretation or application of its provisions."
"The agreement also provides for the exchange of passport specimens between Brazil and the Member States."
"I believe that the safeguarding of existing bilateral agreements should remain of the utmost importance for the European Union as these are providing a short-stay visa waiver for categories of travellers not covered by the EU-Brazil agreement."
"In this regard, it should be recalled that the European Union might apply the suspension clause of the EU-Brazil visa waiver if Brazil were to denounce the bilateral agreements."
"This visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports represents a step forward in the establishment of full reciprocal visa exemption in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 539/2001."
"Although Brazil is part of the so-called 'positive list' of countries whose nationals are exempt from visa requirements when crossing the external borders of the European Union, the nationals of four EU countries - Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus - still cannot benefit from a similar law when they travel to Brazil."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, the common policy on visas in relation to third countries is the exclusive remit of the EU, so it is up to the EU to negotiate this agreement so that it ensures equal treatment of all EU citizens."
"It was agreed that two separate agreements would be signed: one for holders of ordinary passports, and the other for holders of diplomatic, service and official passports."
"I support this decision as it allows the agreement concerning diplomatic, service and official passports, at least, to enter into force faster, since, unlike the agreement on ordinary passports, it does not require ratification by the Brazilian Congress."
"Existing bilateral agreements will remain valid, since they grant short-stay visa waivers for certain categories of passengers that are not covered at all by the EU-Brazil agreement."
"I voted to approve this agreement as the European Parliament's rapporteur."
"This agreement will waive the visa requirement for Brazil for holders of diplomatic, service and official passports and for citizens in four Member States, namely, Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus."
"I believe that the agreement marks a significant advance towards establishing full visa reciprocity for all EU citizens in relation to third countries."
"The efforts aimed at ensuring full reciprocity should continue in order to waive the visa requirement for Canada and the US for citizens from five Member States: Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus and Poland."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation as it represents progress towards full and reciprocal exemption from visa requirements during short stays for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports between the EU and Brazil."
"The signing of this agreement should serve as an example to other countries, namely the US and Canada, which continue to require visas for certain EU Member States."
"In light of the resolution that we voted on today relating to the agreement to be signed between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of common passports, there is even more reason for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports to also benefit from this arrangement."
"Reciprocity in this type of agreement is fundamental and important, so as to ensure that such waivers are not restricted by administrative or bureaucratic requirements which could put the legitimate expectations of citizens in jeopardy."
"Brazil is an increasingly important partner of the European Union, with which it shares a common history and language. Anything that facilitates relations between this major South American country and Europe should be broadly welcomed."
"Under the terms of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, Brazilian citizens can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa, provided that this is for short stays."
"However, not everyone from the European Union has the same privileges."
"Nationals of the following countries find themselves in this situation: Estonia, Cyprus, Malta and Latvia; which means that the principle of reciprocity is not being respected."
"In 2008, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate the signing of an agreement between the EU and Brazil that would put an end to violations of the principle of reciprocity."
"In order to speed up the process and not delay its entry into force, the contracting parties decided to draw up two agreements: one for holders of common passports and another for holders of diplomatic passports (the latter not requiring ratification by the Brazilian Congress)."
"I therefore applaud this initiative, which will guarantee equality of treatment for all European Union citizens, respecting the principle of reciprocity in full."
"Together with my Italian colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I decided to abstain in today's vote regarding relations between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports."
"This is because, in the light of the content of the resolution on the Cesare Battisti case, I would have preferred it if the vote had been postponed ahead of the new decision of the Federal Court in Brazil on the extradition of Cesare Battisti, a criminal."
"Given the non-urgent nature of the dossier, postponing it to the next part-session or the one in April certainly would not have been a problem, especially if we think about the pain of the families of the victims of this mass-murderer."
"These same families have been waiting 31 years for justice to be done and for Cesare Battisti to serve the sentence handed down by Italy's justice system in our own prisons."
"Brazil forms part of the so-called positive list of countries whose citizens are exempt from visa requirements when they cross the external borders of the European Union."
"In line with the principle of reciprocity, which underpins this regulation, all EU citizens should enjoy a similar right when they travel to Brazil."
"Until now, the principle of reciprocity has been applied through bilateral visa waiver agreements concluded between Brazil and Member States on an individual basis."
"However, four EU countries - Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus - have not signed agreements of this type."
"As a result, their citizens are still required to have a visa to travel to Brazil, which violates the principle of reciprocity."
"The EU-Brazil visa waiver agreement, which does not replace the other bilateral agreements signed with different Member States, now covers travel for tourism or business purposes by holders of diplomatic, service or official passports."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this document, because the agreement gives reciprocal access to short-stay, visa-free travel for all EU and Brazilian citizens holding a diplomatic, service or official passport."
"To ensure equal treatment of all EU citizens, Article 8 of the agreement provides that Brazil can suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all Member States of the Union and, reciprocally, the EU may suspend or terminate the agreement only with respect to all Member States."
"This visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports represents a step forward in the establishment of full reciprocal visa exemption in accordance with Regulation No 539/2001."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of giving the EP consent to conclude the two visa-waver agreements with Brazil."
"At present, Brazilian citizens do not need a visa to enter the EU, while citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta, and Cyprus do need a visa to enter Brazil."
"These agreements will ensure the application of the principle of reciprocity regarding visa wavers between the EU and Brazil."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"The visa waiver covers the holders of diplomatic, service or official passports travelling for purposes of tourism or business."
"The citizens of the contracting parties may stay in each other's territory for a maximum period of three months during a six-month period following the date of first entry."
"Visa exemption for travel purposes other than those stipulated in the agreement is still possible under the provisions of bilateral agreements signed by Brazil with 23 of the 27 Member States."
"The agreement takes into account the situation of Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis."
"As long as these Member States (Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area, the visa waiver confers a right on Brazilian citizens to stay for three months on the territory of each of them, irrespective of the period calculated for the entire Schengen area."
"My abstention in the vote on the report regarding the agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-term visa waivers for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports expresses a position that goes beyond the scope of the matter."
"I do not approve of the conduct of the Brazilian Government in the Cesare Battisti case."
"Extradition -procedures for which are defined in a bilateral agreement - should have been granted."
"The interpretation provided by the judicial authorities violates the commitments undertaken."
"The sentence -which Mr Battisti should serve in Italy - was handed down by an ordinary judge, applying ordinary laws to a common crime: mass murder."
"It is difficult to support international relations, such as those defined in the reports voted on by Parliament, with a country that does not respect agreements and which, above all, takes a stand on the fundamental right to the protection of life."
"All European Union citizens who want to travel to Brazil for tourism and business purposes will not require a visa for stays of up to three months, just as Brazilian citizens can already travel without a visa to all EU countries, under the agreement that has now been approved by the European Parliament."
"This agreement will mainly benefit the citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, who still needed a visa to enter Brazil."
"This agreement affects holders of diplomatic, service and official passports."
"With the approval of this agreement, all EU citizens - including citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, for whom Brazil continued to require a visa - will be able to enter the country without a visa for tourism and business purposes, just as Brazilian citizens can already travel without a visa to all EU Member States."
"The length of stay is limited to three months during any six-month period within the Schengen area."
"According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the common visa policy in relation to third countries is the exclusive competence of the EU."
"Only the EU, and not Member States on an individual basis, can negotiate and sign a visa waiver agreement with Brazil."
"This was not the case until the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"This report analyses the EU-Brazil visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic, service and official passports."
"Formal signature of the agreement, on behalf of the Union and of Brazil, took place in Brussels on 8 November 2010."
"This visa waiver agreement does not replace the other bilateral agreements signed with different Member States, but supplements them."
"However, the agreement concluded by the Union will take precedence over the bilateral agreements in the areas covered by these, namely, travel for tourism and business purposes."
"I welcome the clauses on reciprocity between Brazilian nationals and EU citizens, and the guarantee of equality of treatment for all EU citizens."
"Provision has been made for Brazil and the EU only to be able to suspend or repudiate the agreement with regard to all Member States."
"It was for these reasons that I voted in favour."
"I voted in favour of the signing of the EU-Brazil agreement on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports in order to guarantee that, in line with the requirements of the principle of reciprocity and the principle of equality of treatment, all EU citizens who are holders of diplomatic, service or official passports - including citizens of Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus, who, until now, have continued to need a visa to enter Brazilian territory - can travel to Brazil without a visa for tourism or business purposes, just as citizens of Brazil can already travel to EU Member States without a visa."
"in writing. - The visa waiver covers the holders of diplomatic, service or official passports that are travelling for purposes of tourism or business The citizens of the Contracting Parties may stay in each other's territory for a maximum period of three months during a six-month period following the date of first entry into the territory of the other contracting party."
"The visa exemption for travel purposes other than those stipulated in the agreement can still be realised under the provisions of bilateral agreements signed by Brazil with 23 of the 27 Member States."
"The agreement takes into account the situation of Member States that do not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis."
"As long as these Member States (Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area, the visa waiver confers a right on citizens of Brazil to stay for three months on the territory of each of those Member States independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area."
"Brazil forms part of the 'positive list' of countries whose citizens are exempt from visa requirements when crossing the external borders of the European Union."
"Until now, this policy of reciprocity has been applied through bilateral agreements between Brazil and Member States."
"However, Estonia, Latvia, Malta and Cyprus have not signed any kind of agreement and their citizens are not exempt from visa requirements."
"The purpose of this agreement is exemption from visa requirements for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports, and it has the same aim and scope as the agreement relating to holders of common passports."
"However, under Brazilian law, the agreement relating to holders of diplomatic passports does not require ratification by the Brazilian Congress, and it will therefore come into force sooner."
"The two agreements do not replace the bilateral agreements signed between the Member States and Brazil; they simply complement them."
"I believe it to be important for this practice of reciprocity in visa waiver agreements to be applied to other third countries, in order to eliminate the existing discrimination, particularly with regard to the US and Canada."
"Even though I support the content of this agreement, I decided to abstain in the vote in order to protest against the political choices that the Brazilian Government has been taking for some time with regard to Cesare Battisti."
"It is a fact that this murderer, who has been convicted on multiple occasions, is not serving the sentences handed down on him by the Italian justice system."
"I approve this report as I recognise the potential that the Services Directive has for improved integration of the economy, and also believe that the application of the directive can consolidate the mutually reinforcing relationship between the internal market and cohesion policy."
"In order for this objective to be achieved, greater transparency with regard to information for citizens and businesses is necessary."
"It is important to note the conditions for non-application of the country of origin principle in certain matters or activities, in particular, with regard to different legislation contained within other EU instruments and to the set of guarantees that the administering state should provide for posted workers."
"This matter caused a long discussion, and prevented the early application of the directive."
"I fear that the application of this directive at a regional and local level could work against deregulation measures and impede attempts to simplify administrative procedures, especially as its application may involve additional resources, the contribution of structural funds and other instruments being essential to make up for this during the transition period."
"Within this context, I call for greater coherence and coordination among all policies."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on the implementation of the Services Directive, which entered into force in 2006."
"The aim of this directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement, the basis for the common market."
"In other words, European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the EU."
"The directive covers various services, whose gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for 40% of EU GDP."
"We expect the implementation of this directive to potentially bring a profit of up to EUR 140 billion and for EU GDP to grow by 1.5%."
"However, for the directive to deliver the expected benefits, it must be properly implemented."
"Unfortunately, it has been established that not all EU Member States managed to transpose it fully into national law by the end of 2009."
"I agree that setting up the points of single contact is an essential part of effective implementation of this directive."
"These PSCs are aimed at providing the required information and creating an opportunity to carry out all procedures by electronic means and not only in the national language."
"According to European Commission data, 22 EU Member States have established such PSCs, but only 17 of these have e-government portals and these also vary greatly across the different Member States."
"It must be emphasised that without properly functioning points of single contact, consumers will not receive all the information, and this will prevent us from achieving the objectives laid down by the directive."
"The potential benefits deriving from the implementation of the Services Directive are incontrovertible."
"The activities covered by the directive account for 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs in the European Union."
"By implementing it correctly, we could unlock enormous economic potential, creating jobs and contributing to the economic recovery."
"The quality of the implementation of the directive by the Member States is just as essential as respecting the deadlines set for that purpose."
"In the negotiations preceding the adoption of the directive, Parliament has already shown that it can play a crucial role."
"Consequently, I think that Parliament should provide monitoring of the process of implementation of the directive by Member States."
"European service providers must be able to offer their activities throughout the European Union, without being held back by bureaucratic hindrances."
"However, during the implementation phase, we must also be aware of other aspects, particularly the administrative costs that currently weigh down on Member States."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the procedure for mutual evaluation introduced by the Council causes unnecessary bureaucratic burdens for Member States' administrations at national, regional and local level."
"I hope that the potential advantages of these procedures are assessed as soon as possible, otherwise high bureaucratic costs will persist."
"I voted in favour of this text."
"This was not about assessing the implementation of the Services Directive adopted by Parliament in 2006, since it is still far too early for that."
"This was about not only highlighting the importance, both economic and social, of this opening of the services sector in Europe (the areas covered account for 40% of European Union GDP and jobs, and the potential for growth would be between 0.6 and 1.5% of GDP), but also emphasising the fundamental components of the directive's transposition."
"Firstly, the points of single contact (PSC)."
"Their purpose is to facilitate the provision of services across Europe."
"In practical terms, entrepreneurs who wish to set up a business abroad or provide cross-border services should be able to use a PSC, which will explain all the formalities and procedures they must complete in order to set up their business."
"These PSCs are the key to the success of the Services Directive."
"Secondly, the scope of the directive: I believe that we must hold a genuine political debate at European level on what we mean by services of general interest and the rules that we wish to apply to them."
"I voted in favour of this document."
"The aim of the Services Directive is to make it significantly easier for self-employed persons and small and medium-sized companies in particular to pursue their activities, develop new areas of business and also recruit new staff in other Member States."
"The services sector, which accounts for 40% of EU GDP, is particularly important for economic growth and for combating unemployment."
"This directive is an essential step towards a single market for services, which should enable enterprises, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, to provide better services at a competitive price throughout the internal market and to unlock the enormous economic and job-creation potential of the European internal market in services."
"For service providers to properly enjoy the benefits of the Services Directive, the full and timely implementation of the provisions of this directive should be ensured in all Member States."
"I believe that the Commission must closely monitor the application of the directive in the Member States and issue regular implementation reports in order to remove the remaining obstacles in the services sector and to unlock its economic potential."
"The Services Directive, adopted in December 2006, puts the principle of free movement into practice, with the aim of creating a common market for services within the European Union."
"Although it was adopted in 2006, this assessment of its implementation has revealed several delays in its transposition in some Member States, due to both legislative and technical issues, as different legislative instruments were required for its correct implementation."
"A fully functioning single market for services is essential for Europe's economic recovery, representing more than 70% of jobs and of net job creation within the single market."
"Gains at a European Union level could reach a total of between EUR 60 and 140 billion, which represents potential growth of between 0.6 and 1.4% of GDP."
"In light of the above, I supported this report on implementation of the Services Directive as I believe assessments of the implementation of directives to be important, taking into account the fact that such assessments may reveal existing flaws in their implementation, making it possible to correct them."
"The application of the Services Directive is the chance, in my opinion, to highlight its shortcomings, particularly with regard to its scope."
"In my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Employment, I mentioned the legal uncertainty that currently surrounds Services of General Interest (SGI) and the absolute need for their specific nature to be taken into account."
"While there is unanimous agreement on the need to clarify the concepts (economic and non-economic SGI, social services), Parliament is still very much divided on the subject of how to achieve this."
"I advocated the need for a clear legislative framework, if necessary, through a framework directive."
"Although I regret that this is not in the final text, I congratulate Mrs Gebhardt, who has managed to mention these issues in her report on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which focused mainly on mutual evaluation and the points of single contact."
"Paragraph 45 mentions the need for a legislative framework, admittedly at a sectoral level, and recalls the commitment made by Mr Barnier in his recent communication to submit proposals on SGIs in 2011."
"Hence, I am waiting for those proposals to be submitted and for measures that can finally provide an answer to service providers and local and regional authorities, but also recognise the vital contribution that these services make to social and territorial cohesion."
"The European Services Directive entered into force in December 2006 with the ambitious objective of opening up the market for service providers in the European Union, phasing out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfilling the principle of freedom of movement of goods and services in the Union."
"According to the provisions of the directive, European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the European Union."
"The own-initiative report under discussion, put forward by Parliament to keep a close watching brief on the implementation process of the directive in national legal systems, assesses the work done so far by the Member States."
"In particular, delays have been detected in the process of implementing the directive, as well as considerable problems of interpretation regarding the scope of its application."
"Therefore, to protect operators in the market, I am calling for an urgent and unequivocal definition of the services coming under this directive."
"Lastly, I believe that the effective implementation of the Internal Market Information System, the broadening of its functions and greater digitalisation of the points of single contact in Europe would doubtless represent a huge advantage for service providers and would make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access information."
"I voted in favour of this report, because the aim of the Services Directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement, the basis for the common market."
"In principle, the scope of the Services Directive covers all commercial services offered by a service provider established in a Member State."
"The services that are not covered include non-economic services of general interest, financial services, transport services, the services of temporary employment agencies, health services and those considered social services in the area of care, childcare and social housing."
"Services of general interest are not threatened by the directive, which cannot serve the purpose of undermining public welfare provision."
"There is a need not only to draw a clear distinction between the services coming under this directive and services of general interest, but also to safeguard services of general economic interest by means of framework legislation."
"The Services Directive will not lead, in any way, to deregulation or liberalisation of the services sector, as indicated by some speculation."
"Its purpose is to ensure access to national markets in such a way that arbitrary barriers are phased out and any rules which are maintained in Member States are proportionate and non-discriminatory."
"The directive explicitly states that neither employment law nor employees' rights will be affected by these legislative provisions."
"Parliament even insisted on this point when presenting its view to the Council."
"Article 16 states that no Member State is prevented from imposing requirements with regard to the provision of a service activity, where they are justified for reasons of public policy, public security, public health or the protection of the environment."
"Implementation of the directive is being delayed in some Member States, but this is due, in particular, to the different ways of interpreting it."
"This is why it is important for the directive's area of application to be clearly and transparently defined."
"There is a need not only to draw a clear distinction between the services coming under this directive and services of general interest, but also to safeguard services of general economic interest by means of a legislative framework with this in mind."
"The aim of the Services Directive, which entered into force in December 2006, is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union by getting rid of all protectionist barriers, arbitrary hindrances and any discriminatory rules."
"In addition, Parliament has always insisted that this directive must not form a pretext for dangerous deregulation and liberalisation of the sector."
"I voted in favour of this report, which does well to note the (often unjustified) delays and the disputes over the implementation of the Services Directive, which concerns a sector that accounts for some 40% of gross domestic product (GDP) and jobs in the EU."
"Furthermore, the directive also has the advantage of allowing European enterprises - and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises - to provide better services at competitive prices."
"The correct and transparent transposition of the Services Directive would have the positive effect of unlocking the enormous economic and job-creation potential of the internal market, estimated at 0.6-1.5% of European GDP -something the European Union desperately needs."
"Therefore, the complete transposition of the directive throughout the EU will introduce aspects of competition to the internal market that will result in advantages for citizens and enterprises."
"The Services Directive constitutes a fundamental instrument for the growth of the European Union, enabling self-employed persons and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, to carry out their activities much more easily in other Member States, and to develop new areas of business and recruit personnel there."
"These activities represent 40% of GDP and jobs within the European Union, and are an essential sector in terms of economic growth and combating unemployment."
"It is important to consolidate the enormous potential for economic development and job creation that the European internal market for services represents, as it constitutes an essential step towards a real internal market for services, which should enable businesses and, in particular, SMEs, to provide citizens with better quality services at competitive prices throughout the entire internal market."
"I hope that the aims of the directive can begin to be achieved in the near future, and that the entire EU and its regions can benefit from this, thus contributing to real economic, social and territorial cohesion through the creation of decent, sustainable, quality jobs, and in terms of improving the quality and safety of services provided."
"Parliament is voting on the implementation of the Services Directive, the withdrawal of which had been promised back when it was still called the Bolkestein Directive."
"The European Parliament is now deciding whether or not it was transposed properly in the Member States."
"Services account for 40% of European Union GDP and jobs, with significant differences between Member States."
"The Services Directive is proposing legal 'advances' and standardisation that will take place at the expense of the French people and will result in social standards being levelled downwards."
"The protection of markets and workers, as contributors to the wealth of our country and our continent, is imperative, but the European Union, as ever, opposes that idea."
"I voted in favour of this report, as I believe that the implementation of the Services Directive by Member States has so far been partial and limited."
"Despite this directive being one of the most important European laws, with the aim of opening up the services sector to free movement within the European Union, there is still a long way to go."
"There is a need to guarantee that this legislation, approved more than three years ago, is correctly implemented, particularly with regard to the effective creation of 'points of contact', which any citizen seeking to sell services in another country can use to obtain the necessary information."
"The purpose of Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market is to open up the market to service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of free movement, aiming to achieve a real internal market for the sector."
"The services sector represents 40% of GDP and employment within the Union, and has enormous potential for growth and job creation, particularly within small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The deadline for transposing the directive was the end of 2009, but some Member States are still failing to implement it correctly and effectively."
"The online portal, with all of the necessary administrative information, is only functioning in 22 states, and of these 22, it is only possible to carry out the necessary procedures electronically in 14 of them."
"There is a need to guarantee and monitor the correct application of this directive by Member States, with the aim of eliminating arbitrary barriers and/or making the rules that continue to exist in the Member States proportional and non-discriminatory."
"This draft resolution refers to the implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market."
"The principle of the free movement of people and goods throughout the territory of the European Union is present within all of its treaties, with the aim of supporting the creation of the common market."
"Directive 2006/123/EC was approved with the objective of doing away with the bureaucracy restricting service activities in the Member States."
"However, it can be seen that not all Member States are implementing this directive, due to certain aspects that they consider have not been properly clarified."
"That is why this resolution is relevant."
"I applaud the creation of a rapid and effective means of responding to requests from business people and workers' representatives in the form of 'points of single contact', and I hope that these are not reduced to an electronic format but also involve personal attention, as we know how important this is when we are in a foreign country."
"We voted against this report, in keeping with all our earlier positions relating to the infamous Bolkestein Directive and its unacceptable aims of facilitating the liberalisation of services, including public services, to favour the interests of economic and financial groupings within the European Union, at a cost of increased unemployment and inferior services provided to the respective users, as is already plainly visible within sectors that have gone down this road."
"This report seeks to put pressure on Member States that have not advanced as rapidly as the majority of Members of the European Parliament would like - to protect the interests of European economic groupings - in transposing Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market."
"This directive came into force on 28 December 2006 and aims, as stated within this report, 'to open up the market to service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of free movement, the basis for the common market'."
"What was required, though, was an objective assessment of the consequences of implementing the liberalisation and subsequent privatisation of services, in some cases, essential public services, in order to return to an uncompromising defence of the rights of people and workers."
"The Bolkestein Directive has fallen behind schedule because the Member States are said to have taken too long to transpose it and to have applied it incorrectly."
"It is true that in France, it has been only partially transposed into national law."
"And with good reason!"
"To avoid a public debate, and therefore any further outcry, Mr Sarkozy's government deliberately chose not to use a framework law but to integrate the principles of the directive into all relevant texts."
"In fact, there is only one principle: the full and absolute freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services!"
"Splitting up the legislative amendments has resulted in a process that lacks transparency."
"The scope of the text is still not clear: some social services that are supposedly excluded are, in fact, covered by the directive."
"Those that are actually excluded today have simply been put on the back-burner: every three years, the Commission can suggest getting rid of the exemptions."
"Moreover, as for the most scandalous clause in the text, the country of origin principle, although it has been formally deleted, it has sneaked back in thanks to the possibilities opened up by the directive on the posting of workers and the regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report on the basis that services account for 70% of all jobs and for all net job creation in the single European market and represent the most important source of foreign direct investment."
"The Services Directive creates the fundamental framework for a higher degree of free movement of service providers, strengthens the rights of consumers as recipients of services and enhances the availability of information, assistance and transparency with regard to service providers and their services."
"For these reasons, proper implementation of the Services Directive should remain a top priority for the Commission."
"Therefore, the Commission must work with Member States to further improve administrative cooperation of mechanisms that fall within the scope of the directive, in particular, by ensuring that Member States put into place fully operative points of single contact."
"Furthermore, I encourage the Commission, together with the Member States, to continue to develop the single market in services on the basis of the 'mutual evaluation' process set out in the Services Directive, in order to receive updated feedback from consumers, citizens and businesses with regard to national measures for implementation of the Services Directive in their respective Member States, thereby ensuring that Member States truly take ownership of the single market."
"Adopted in 2006, the Services Directive, which should have been transposed into national law before 28 December 2009, continues to raise questions in the Member States and within local authorities that are directly affected by it."
"The parliamentary own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt, which proposes an initial assessment of the directive's implementation, thus touches on some of these difficulties, and especially the uncertainty surrounding social services and services of general economic interest (how are they defined? which areas are affected?), as well as the lack of transparency of the transposition process in some Member States."
"Moreover, it must be said that France stands out due to its problematic lack of transparency and inflexibility in implementing this directive."
"It has scores of decrees and implementing laws, and a restrictive interpretation of the exemptions set out in the directive, which raises doubts as to the future of some services, such as childcare and care for the disabled."
"Now more than ever, this own-initiative report, which has been adopted by a large majority, is an opportunity to point out that MEPs, and especially the Socialists, will continue to be vigilant with regard to the implementation of this directive and its impact on public services."
"Four years after the adoption of the Services Directive, the European Parliament gave its verdict this week on the implementation of the directive in the Member States."
"A shortage of information, standstills in terms of cross-border services, unnecessary administrative constraints, and so on, are the criticisms voiced by the European Parliament in the report that we have adopted and of which I have voted in favour."
"Indeed, Member States need to make progress in implementing this directive in order to improve and facilitate the provision of cross-border services."
"Aside from that, I would like to emphasise the difficult issue of the directive's scope, which excludes a number of areas, such as non-economic services of general interest and some services (social services, childcare, assistance to people, and so on) carried out by providers mandated by the State."
"Two concepts, 'non-economic service of general interest' and 'mandating', are not clearly defined and/or their interpretation differs from one Member State to another."
"This has resulted in a lack of legal clarity, which I deeply regret."
"It is of major significance for the common European internal market that the Member States implement the Services Directive quickly and effectively."
"It is particularly important for small and medium-sized businesses which want to be able to offer their services across national borders to have a point of single contact that can provide them with essential information and explain the necessary procedures."
"More than a year has now passed since the deadline for the Member States to implement the Services Directive."
"It does not make much sense for us to continue discussing the numerous amendments."
"It would be more useful to investigate the implementation process more closely."
"Although some Member States have already taken the necessary measures, others seem to have forgotten about the document that they signed."
"Therefore, we must ensure that the directive is implemented immediately and correctly in all 27 Member States, in order to simplify the process of providing services in other countries as quickly as possible."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on the implementation of the Services Directive, which entered into force in 2006."
"The aim of this directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement, the basis for the common market."
"The purpose of the directive is to influence access to the markets in such a way that arbitrary barriers are phased out and any rules that are maintained in the Member States are appropriate and non-discriminatory."
"It has been expressly confirmed that neither employment law nor employees' rights are affected by the legislative project, an aspect to which Parliament has attached special importance."
"European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the EU."
"The directive covers various services, whose gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for 40% of EU GDP."
"I agree that setting up the points of single contact is an essential part of the effective implementation of this directive."
"The Services Directive is a vital step towards a genuine single services market, which will enable businesses, especially SMEs, to offer citizens better services at competitive prices."
"I supported the position of the rapporteur who thinks that setting up points of single contact (PSC) is a key element to implementing this directive effectively."
"This instrument may be significantly important to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"PSCs must make available precise, complete and comprehensive information on formalities, administrative procedures, employment law, taxation systems in operation in Member States, especially for VAT, and so on. Moreover, business people should receive assistance in completing the necessary administrative procedures."
"I think that, after full transposition, it is crucial that a comprehensive assessment should be carried out of the impact of the Services Directive on economic activity, qualitative and quantitative levels of employment, social protection, fulfilment of environmental objectives and the quality of services offered to consumers."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution."
"The Services Directive adopted in 2006 aimed to harmonise certain aspects of the single market related to the provision of services."
"Full implementation by Member States should have been achieved by the end of 2009."
"I call on those Member States who have not fulfilled their obligations to do so as a matter of urgency."
"The only positive contribution of this text is the invitation for Member States to 'ensure greater transparency' when transposing this Services Directive."
"The French Government is not taking any notice!"
"Apart from that, this report by a social-democrat MEP validates the neoliberal diktat of this harmful directive and even goes as far as to call to order Member States which 'lack ambition' in implementing it."
"Worse still, this House admits to being unable to assess the consequences of its implementation!"
"This is probably why there is no roll-call vote."
"The names of those responsible will not be known."
"I shall vote against it."
"Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market seeks to eliminate the barriers that still exist to the cross-border provision of services."
"After some difficulties with the transposition of the directive, due to doubts on the part of some Member States, the guidelines of this procedure, designed to simplify coordination between Member States with regard to consumer protection, environmental protection, and public health and safety, will finally be put into practice in all Member States, and this report will contribute to the even more effective implementation and improved operability of the measures put forward."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The EU provides a wide range of opportunities for service providers in particular."
"Standardised EU regulations have made cross-border working much easier and employees are being offered an increasing number of incentives to spend a few years working abroad."
"However, they are often confronted with national laws relating to services which they do not understand and which frequently lead to problems or misunderstandings."
"I have not voted in favour of the report, because it does not provide enough information about the costs of the points of single contact."
"The adoption of the Services Directive is aimed at making it easier for businesses to operate beyond their national borders."
"The system established has significantly reduced the amount of administrative obstacles."
"Nevertheless, experience shows that there are still a lot of bureaucratic pitfalls for small businesses to overcome in some European Union Member States."
"The planned principle of one-stop shops is not working in many countries or is not working appropriately, and entrepreneurs sometimes still have to obtain endless licences which must be checked by a whole host of inspection bodies."
"Such inconveniences are faced not only by local entrepreneurs, but also service providers wishing to provide services in other EU Member States."
"I therefore agree with the text of the report and also call on the EU Member States to continue to make life easier for business and ensure the free movement of services."
"The process of transposing the Services Directive is based on a delicate procedure that aims to create transparency and consistency in the Member States' systems with reference to the outcomes of the implementation of the directive itself, as well as to evaluate the outcomes for the internal market following transposition."
"This is the objective of the report, which I voted in favour of given the need to verify the work of the Member States."
"Promoting the convergence of regulations through mutual assessment of their effective transposition would not only facilitate the work of the Member States (which are running so late that in this report, Parliament deems it necessary to monitor their work) but would also set a definite framework for the system of points of single contact, which will guarantee the flow of information to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I should merely like to note that our economy is based 75% on services and that in a global market, they must certainly represent our strong point."
"I believe that greater liberalisation, which does not mean a lack of rules but merely more competition, is desirable for the future."
"The Services Directive seeks to contribute to the completion of the internal market for services, with the concomitant guarantee of high levels of quality and social cohesion."
"It is an instrument intended to serve the purpose of growth within the EU and its implementation is included within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy and the Single Market Act."
"Transposition of the Services Directive constitutes a major challenge for Member States, public administrations and local authorities, both because of what it prescribes with regard to the right to establishment and the provision of services, and because of the creation of points of single contact to assist service providers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"This directive enables self-employed people and SMEs, in particular, to carry out their activities much more easily in other Member States, and to develop new areas of business and recruit personnel there."
"I voted in favour as I am convinced that, because the internal market information system and points of single contact require a great effort at administrative cooperation among all the authorities involved, they will give rise to greater interoperability and the creation of networks at a national, regional and local level throughout the EU, bringing the outermost regions closer to a real internal market."
"The purpose of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market (the Services Directive) is to open up the market to service providers within the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of free movement, the basis for the common market."
"It is an important instrument on the way towards a real internal market for services, which aims to enable businesses and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, to provide better quality services at competitive prices throughout the entire territory of the EU, contributing to the promotion of prosperity and competitiveness, as well as to the creation of jobs."
"It is therefore essential, as the rapporteur rightly points out, to ensure its satisfactory transposition and implementation by Member States, which need to guarantee the elimination of bureaucratic barriers and access to the relevant information for business people, specifically by promoting the creation of points of single contact."
"I have voted in favour of the report on implementing the Services Directive because I believe it to be very balanced."
"It focuses on assessing the practical difficulties and makes specific proposals on resolving them."
"I come from a country where the Services Directive has not been implemented in national law."
"I believe it is essential that the directive is implemented and it must be accompanied by measures to prevent the introduction of cheap labour and social dumping."
"In my opinion, it is also important that the report on implementing the Services Directive highlights the areas which have been deliberately omitted, such as social and healthcare services."
"This must be followed down to the last full stop during the implementation process."
"Nearly four and a half years after the adoption of the notorious Services Directive, known as the Bolkestein Directive, this essential issue, which covers a wide spectrum of activities accounting for around 40% of EU GDP and jobs, is once again on the European Parliament's agenda."
"Fortunately, things have now quietened down and the left-leaning parties seem to have abandoned their dogmatic posturing on the Services Directive, the purpose of which, it is important to point out, is to remove the unnecessary and restrictive obstacles to the provision of services within the European Union."
"It should be said that the Gebhardt report voted on today is less concerned with the content of the text than with assessing the Member States' efforts to transpose it."
"This transposition is in accordance with the directive, since the Member States were required to simplify their administrative procedures and to set up 'points of single contact' by the end of 2009, so that businesses could complete their formalities more easily by electronic means."
"The least we can say is that there is still progress to be made in many Member States so as to strengthen the single market and facilitate the day-to-day work of SMEs, only 8% of which operate beyond their national borders."
"Today in this House, we voted on the report on the Implementation of the Services Directive."
"The aim of the directive is to open up the market for service providers in the European Union, phase out the Member States' protectionist barriers on the exercise of service activities and fulfil the principle of freedom of movement of goods and services in the Union, which is at the heart of the single market."
"In short, European service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the European Union."
"The own-initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt enables us to assess the implementation of the Services Directive, the three-year period for the implementation of which came to an end on 28 December 2009, this highly important directive having entered into force in December 2006."
"The rapporteur's assessment indeed demonstrates that some Member States have still not adopted all the horizontal legislation that this directive requires in order to be correctly implemented, which is why work is still required to try and put in place all the mechanisms provided for by the Services Directive."
"in writing. - We finally voted against the text because, regarding services of general interest, the report considers that the majority of Member States did not encounter any significant problems."
"Although this wording waters down a bit the initial proposal by the EPP shadow (Handzlik, Poland) according to which there has been no problem at all, this still tends to ignore the uncertainties created by the directive regarding, in particular, the social services to be included or excluded in its scope."
"Furthermore, the report maintains enthusiastic expectations regarding the impact on employment, whereas there has been no impact assessment at all from the Commission, and some national impact assessments indicate very low quantitative impact figures in terms of job creation; there are no impact figures regarding job losses; furthermore, there is nothing regarding the impact on the quality of jobs, not to speak about the pressure on the level of labour standards created by some ECJ case-law after the adoption of the directive."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that the full realisation of a dynamic services market is one of the basic priorities for the European Union."
"Currently, despite the significant advances made by the single market, services represent just one fifth of total trade in Europe and a mere 8% of small and medium-sized enterprises operate in Member States other than their own."
"The figures shown in the Communication on the Single Market adopted by the Commission last October are quite clear: by liberalising services, we would obtain a 4% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 10 years."
"This objective can only be reached by developing and implementing shared rules."
"At this time of crisis, we must exploit existing growth potential by helping enterprises to grow, innovate and create more jobs."
"This is the only way we will manage to offer better and more competitive services to both consumers and businesses."
"The single services market must be a tool to restore economic growth, win back consumer trust and guarantee reliable products for all."
"There are still a number of restrictions on services in the single market, and so this is an important report in that it analyses the implementation of the solutions that have been adopted."
"The Services Directive aims to achieve full implementation of the single internal services market."
"It is also intended to make it significantly easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to start up and extend their operations."
"This will promote the creation of new jobs and help fight unemployment."
"Citizens will be offered higher quality services at more competitive prices, and safety levels in the sector will be improved."
"However, it will be vital to assess the impact of the directive after it has been fully implemented by the Member States."
"The European Parliament, as one of the key players in the project, should play a major role in monitoring this process."
"Speedy and correct implementation of the directive is a key condition for achieving the goals of cohesion policy and regional policy, and may help us to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, by serving to eliminate the single market fatigue currently apparent in the services sector."
"in writing. - (NL) In 2006, liberalisation of the services market was introduced."
"At the time, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance voted against the Services Directive because it had many shortcomings and because it failed to guarantee legal certainty."
"The report which is to be put to the vote today takes stock of the difficulties which we encountered in implementing this Services Directive."
"Although it contains some good elements, such as the call for a regular review and the investigation of long-term effects, it also contains elements with which I disagree, for example, the statement that Member States have experienced few or no significant difficulties in the process of implementation."
"That is simply untrue, because it remains unclear whether or not certain social services are covered by the directive."
"The report is also too optimistic about the possibility of jobs being created."
"No research has ever been carried out into the number of jobs created, nor has there been any into the number of job losses that have occurred or the quality of jobs available, let alone the increased pressure on labour conditions following the judgments of the Court of Justice."
"Moreover, the report fails to mention a single word about the legal uncertainty which will arise as a result of the fact that no clear alternative has been formulated for the principle of the country of origin."
"The Greens, however, did request a review of the ban on Member States imposing additional requirements on service providers, but that request was rejected."
"I voted against."
"in writing. - I supported this report on the implementation of the Services Directive 2006/123/EC."
"It is important that social rights and labour law are respected as the internal market is improved for services, all of which will benefit traders as well as consumers."
"in writing. - I strongly endorse the Gebhardt report."
"The Services Directive implementation deadline passed a year ago, and I welcome the fact that Parliament is shining the spotlight on Member States' progress."
"The services sector accounts for a large share of the EU's GDP, yet the cross-border trading of services still falls well short of the level of trade in goods."
"This report shows that implementation is incomplete and that the full benefits of the directive have not yet been reaped by citizens."
"The points of single contact (PSCs) in each Member State, which inform service providers of rights and opportunities in other EU Member States, are an important provision of the directive."
"In my view, the crucial issue raised by this report is the huge under-use of these PSCs."
"I firmly support the proposal that an effective information campaign be led to raise the visibility of PSCs."
"The Commission should earmark funds for a promotional campaign."
"However, I also underline the role to be played by authorities on the ground in the Member States who have the contacts and expertise needed to ensure this campaign is well targeted."
"Unless this is done, the Union's efforts to foster the cross-border trading of services will be in vain."
"The implementation of the abortive anti-labour law on the 'liberalisation' of services, known as the Bolkestein Directive, promotes sweeping reactionary changes at the expense of the working and grassroots classes."
"The opening up of the services markets, which account for 40% of GDP and jobs in the EU, involves abolishing collective agreements, striking at the wage, labour, social and other rights won by the workers and selling off strategic public sectors of the economy which are the property of the people."
"The European Parliament has called in its motion for a resolution on services for the EU and the bourgeois governments in the Member States to speed up capitalist restructurings, so that the directive on the 'liberalisation' of services can be implemented in full, based on the Commission's recent communication entitled 'Towards a Single Market Act' in 2011, the aim being to make further drastic cuts to the workforce and to enable the monopolies to penetrate new, profitable sectors for capital."
"The creation of points of single contact (PSCs) for service companies in all the Member States is a pretext for speeding up the implementation of the anti-labour directive, the ratification of which has triggered a storm of protest by workers in all the Member States."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against this motion for a resolution on the implementation of the Services Directive."
"in writing. - I fully support Evelyne Gebhardt's report on the implementation of the Services Directive."
"The activities of the 2006 directive account for 40% of EU GDP and jobs."
"However, the different implementation methods of Member States have made it difficult for the service sector to take full advantage of the directive."
"Allowing service providers to operate outside their own country is integral to the EU's single market and reducing the bureaucracy at national level can allow the directive to make a contribution to EU economic growth and its jobs objectives."
"According to the report, each Member State must ensure that more information is disseminated to businesses that want to provide services across borders."
"Doing this through points of single contact (PSCs) will allow the service sector to benefit from cross-border trade."
"Ensuring that the PSCs provide a human as well as an electronic contact point is also vital to ensure that users receive all the relevant information and that questions are answered."
"The report also proposes the inclusion of services that were exempt from the original directive in 2006: healthcare, transport and social services."
"This would further expand the scope of the directive and would bring benefits to more service sector workers."
"In the EU, the service sector is responsible for around 70% of GDP."
"In some countries, such as Austria, where I come from, this sector is an engine of economic growth."
"The aim of the directive is to remove unreasonable obstacles to the provision of cross-border services."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular are frequently confronted with bureaucratic barriers and discrimination which prevent them from benefiting fully from the common internal market."
"The directive takes into consideration the specific social circumstances of the individual Member States."
"Strengthening the control options in the destination country represents an important step forward."
"However, we need to put in place quickly a mechanism for imposing effective sanctions on foreign service providers which break the law."
"I have voted in favour of Mrs Gebhardt's report, because I hope that the implementation of the Services Directive will provide a new stimulus for the labour market."
"I approve this report, as I believe it to be a satisfactory and balanced compromise that succeeds in guaranteeing the rights of passengers without simultaneously imposing a heavy burden on carriers, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is therefore a success for Parliament, which managed to change the scope from 500 km, supported by the Council, to 250 km, as well as with regard to the rights of passengers, affecting people with reduced mobility in particular."
"The following should also be highlighted: a guarantee of accommodation in the event of cancellation, a right to immediate assistance in the event of an accident, a right to compensation in the event of cancellation, and the electronic provision of up-to-date information to passengers."
"in writing. - We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that:"
"1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers;"
"2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service."
"The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK."
"We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, in which the European Parliament expresses its position on protecting the rights of passengers."
"The regulation shall apply to regular services, within and between EU Member States, where the scheduled distance is no greater than 250 km."
"We are talking about the rights of bus passengers when a bus or coach service is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes."
"Then passengers should immediately be offered a choice between continuing their journey or re-routing to their final destination at no additional cost or reimbursement of the ticket price."
"If the carrier fails to offer this choice, passengers shall have the right to compensation in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price."
"In the event of cancellation or delay, it is also important for passengers to be provided with all necessary information."
"Furthermore, assistance must also be offered where a journey of more than three hours is cancelled or delayed in departure for more than 90 minutes."
"In such instances, meals or refreshments must be offered, as well as hotel accommodation for a maximum of two nights."
"However, the obligation to provide accommodation does not apply if the cancellation or delay is caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters."
"Bearing in mind the difficulties experienced by passengers this winter, when they were unable to reach their destination due to weather conditions and even had to spend several nights in stations, their right to accommodation should be ensured."
"In the European Union, more than 70 million Europeans travel by bus and coach every year."
"The firm stance adopted by the European Parliament on the rights of persons travelling by bus or coach means that, from now on, transport operators will provide information, assistance and compensation across the whole EU to comply with passengers' rights."
"Regardless of the means of transport they use, Europeans now enjoy EU-level protection."
"I support this report which regulates the overbooking of buses and coaches or departures delayed by more than two hours for journeys longer than 250 kilometres, as well as the cancellation of journeys."
"Furthermore, I believe that the policy of non-discrimination against persons with reduced mobility is reflected in a set of basic rights concerning the provision of assistance at bus stations, including free transport for particular items of equipment such as wheelchairs."
"I voted for this report, which supports the rights of persons with disabilities and reduced mobility, such as non-discriminatory access to transport and the right to compensation for the loss of or damage to wheelchairs or other mobility equipment."
"Persons with disabilities must have access to a transport system and the rights of persons with reduced mobility must be safeguarded in terms of getting assistance at stops and terminals."
"While I agree that passengers have the right to get better information and help from bodies and at terminals throughout the EU, it is important not to unduly burden the small, domestic or voluntary bodies that operate in rural areas, something which would put pressure on them to cut back on the services they provide."
"Often, the bus services provided by the domestic or voluntary bodies are services essential to local and rural communities."
"Higher prices and a restriction on the number of available routes would be the result of the additional costs recommended in the report and some bodies would possibly be forced to close."
"Excessive regulation would place a huge burden on these bodies, some of which are already under pressure, and a restricted service for rural people would be the result."
"A transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this important document."
"With growth in the transport sector and EU citizens' increasing mobility, it is essential to establish EU-wide rights for the protection of passengers and to secure a level playing field between carriers from different Member States."
"Air passengers have long had many rights, and two years ago, EU rail and air passengers were given the same rights and a high level of protection was ensured."
"Similar rights must also be ensured for bus passengers and opportunities to travel must be improved for persons with reduced mobility."
"I believe that following lengthy and complicated negotiations, it has been possible to reach a really good and balanced agreement with the Council, which fully protects passenger rights without imposing a burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Henceforth, bus passengers will have the right to compensation if a journey is cancelled, delayed or postponed, while the issue of damaged or lost baggage has also been addressed and clear rules have been laid down on rights to compensation in the event of an accident."
"in writing. - We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that:"
"1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers;"
"2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service."
"The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK."
"We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception."
"Bringing the rights of bus and coach passengers into line with those of rail and air passengers is, of course, an excellent intention."
"Nevertheless, I abstained because in my opinion, the text does not go far enough."
"Indeed, limiting to 250 kilometres the threshold for compensation in the event of a major problem means effectively excluding three countries of the European Union. Yet a simple derogation mechanism for the countries concerned could easily have been introduced."
"More generally, bus and coach passengers are, on the whole, less well off."
"Since mobility is an issue that comes up often, it would have been a good idea to send them a message concerning much shorter journeys than 250 kilometres."
"Regarding the text in question, I cannot but support the report by Mr Cancian whereby, at the heart of institutional debate, we are not only striving to create a common body of guarantees for the rights of bus and coach passengers, but also to give proper consideration to the mobility requirements of handicapped and disabled persons."
"For this reason, bus and coach companies are urged to be equipped and trained to provide a minimal level of assistance to disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility, as long as the passenger informs the company of their needs not less than 36 hours prior to departure."
"The compromise reached therefore seems to establish shared minimum standards very much in passengers' favour, without putting excessive burdens on carriers, which are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Based on the outcome of the vote on Tuesday, the European Parliament has successfully added the missing piece to European passengers' rights legislation, which is to be implemented across the board from spring 2013."
"The negotiations have been difficult."
"However, they will cover all national or cross-border road transport services over distances in excess of 250 km."
"Road transport norms had to be standardised at a time when European citizens are increasingly using this form of transport as it offers a cheaper and more convenient option for short distances not covered by air transport."
"In the context of European traffic, it is only natural that the road transport sector has similar compensation rules to those applied to air transport, which were standardised a long time ago."
"In too many instances, road carriers apply the rule of using their own discretion, especially in the countries which have recently become Member States."
"However, making them liable can only help improve the services offered."
"Every passenger, whether travelling by air or road, must be aware of their rights, especially in situations where they pay for a certain service and sometimes receive something completely different."
"I hope that not very many states will request a temporary exemption from these regulations and that they will be applied across the board from 2013."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Cancian for his excellent work, thanks to which we were able to reach a satisfying and well-balanced compromise."
"Indeed, as a result of this report, from this day forth, the rights of bus and coach passengers - the only ones hitherto not specifically protected at European level - will also be guaranteed."
"I therefore voted in favour of this document, in which I also appreciate the attention paid to the automotive companies operating in the sector."
"In fact, the agreements reached managed to avoid putting excessive burdens on carriers, which are often family-run and of modest dimensions."
"At the same time, I think it is important that the European Union adopt a specific regulation that will lead shortly to a charter of passengers' rights, focusing, in particular, on the needs of disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility."
"I regard the approved text of the regulation as a balanced compromise, securing rights for passengers without, at the same time, representing an excessive administrative burden for transport operators, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I consider it a success that the European Parliament has, against the will of the Council, extended the scope of the regulation to all regular domestic and cross-border transport with a distance of 250 km or more, while the Council was proposing a minimum distance of 500 km."
"I welcome the fact that in case of a cancellation, a delay longer than 120 minutes or over-acceptance of reservations, passengers will, in addition to the right to continue with their journey or take another route to their destination or reimbursement of the ticket price, have the right to compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price."
"In view of the fact that the regulation on bus passenger rights is linked to the regulation on rail passenger rights, I am not pleased that, in contrast to bus passengers, rail passengers in many EU states must wait for their rights to be applied, especially regarding the right to reimbursement of a quarter to half of the fare where there is a delay of more than one hour."
"The Czech Ministry of Transport has also made use of the option to postpone the implementation of this European legislation by five years."
"The reason it gave for this was the relatively extensive construction activities on the Czech rail network, which cause trains to be delayed."
"In the final analysis, this means introducing a system of double standards, disadvantaging one group of passengers compared to another."
"in writing. - We have opposed this legislation on the grounds that it is certain that:"
"1. the extra costs incurred for extra rights will translate into permanently higher ticket costs across the board for all passengers;"
"2. bus and coach routes which are making marginal or no profit, having no room for increased ticket prices, will be cut entirely and there will be no service."
"The EU should not have the right to make laws for the UK."
"We assert the right of the UK as a nation state to govern itself and make its own laws, transport and environment laws being no exception."
"Given that the transport sector is constantly expanding, it has become essential to ensure that passenger protection rights, comparable to those applying to other modes of transport, also apply throughout the whole of the EU to bus and coach transport, which has seen growth above 5% and has recorded an annual volume of 72.8 million passengers."
"It is also important to ensure that there is a level playing field, in terms of competition, between transport companies in different Member States and between different modes of transport."
"I therefore consider it important that it has been possible to reach an agreement, after nearly two years of negotiations, that will enable this type of passenger to benefit from an entire set of rights, particularly in terms of assistance in the event of accidents, delays, cancellations, refunds, etc., at the same time as special attention is paid to the rights of people with disabilities and reduced mobility."
"I support this compromise as I believe it to be quite satisfactory and balanced, since it succeeds in guaranteeing the rights of passengers without simultaneously imposing a heavy burden on carriers, which, in the majority of cases, are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I feel it bodes well that the final text can be regarded as a very satisfactory and well-balanced compromise as it manages to secure the rights of passengers without, at the same time, imposing excessively restrictive measures on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In December 2008, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"The main purpose of this proposal was to introduce common provisions concerning these rights."
"This has now been done, and I am delighted that passengers travelling at least 250 km by bus will now have the same EU-wide rights to information, assistance and compensation in the event of a cancellation, overbooking or delay of two hours or more."
"Passengers should have the choice between receiving a refund for the price of the ticket or continuing their journey under the same conditions and at no additional cost."
"If a refund is the only option available, compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price will have to be paid."
"Moreover, passengers will also be entitled to compensation if their luggage is lost or damaged."
"in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament has this week voted on a report that is intended to secure rights for bus and coach passengers at European level."
"The compromise with the Council is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately, the scope of the regulation is limited and we therefore chose to abstain from the vote."
"We believe it to be problematic that three Member States - Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus - have been excluded from the agreement, as this considerably weakens the overall protection of passengers in Europe."
"We also believe that the distance of 250 km is too long to be used as a basis for EU legislation, as it means in practice that bus and coach passengers travelling from Luxembourg to Strasbourg or from Malmö to Växjö would not be protected by the legislation."
"That is regrettable."
"We are also opposed to the force majeure clause that limits the liability of carriers in the event of cancellations or delays if they are caused by difficult weather conditions or major natural disasters."
"We consider this to be setting a worrying precedent for the forthcoming review of the regulation on the rights of air passengers."
"However, we welcome the improvement in the rights of people with disabilities that this agreement entails and the additional assistance that these people will now receive."
"I voted in favour of this report on the rights of bus and coach transport passengers, as they are granted rights comparable to those of passengers on other modes of transport."
"The new regulation includes important provisions, particularly with regard to the rights of people with disabilities or people with restricted mobility, as well as the rights of passengers in the event of cancellation or delay."
"Whatever means of transport is used, passengers have the right to be provided with a quality and safe service, for which reason I consider the intention to introduce harmonised rules on passenger rights for bus and coach transport throughout the entire territory of the EU to be positive."
"Furthermore, I believe that passenger rights should essentially be the same, whatever type of transport is used, except in cases where this would be incompatible with the characteristics of the means of transport in question."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, Mr Simpson, the rapporteur and everyone else involved in the negotiations in the Conciliation Committee on the work carried out and on the agreement reached with regard to the final version of this regulation."
"This report relates to a joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the basic rights of passengers who use bus and coach transport."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Conciliation Committee on the work carried out and the consensus achieved."
"From the three rights initially put forward by the Council, it has actually been possible to arrive at 12, among which I would highlight the rules on accountability, compensation, assistance, alternative transport and special attention to passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility."
"I therefore welcome this additional step taken by the European Union, which, I am sure, will increase the number of passengers travelling by bus and coach due to the feeling of safety and comfort that it will introduce, which will contribute significantly to the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"The agreement on the rights of bus and coach passengers that was reached by Parliament and the Council within the Conciliation Committee redefines the scope of the regulation established at second reading, restricting it to passengers using road services known as 'long distance' - defining these as services involving a journey of 250 km or more."
"At the same time, it defines 12 basic rights for short-distance passengers, focusing on the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility, such as compensation in the event of loss or damage caused to wheelchairs and other mobility equipment, non-discriminatory tickets and terms of carriage, and rights to information."
"These are proposals that we naturally support."
"However, we must express some doubts with regard to the amendments introduced within the Conciliation Committee, as well as the criteria used for the implementation of the regulation."
"The different sizes and characteristics of EU countries may make it difficult to apply the regulation in some of them, especially in the smallest ones, where it is difficult to include many journeys within the adopted concept of a 'long-distance' journey, which may result in their passengers being deprived of the rights in question without reasonable justification."
"After many years of procedure, the adoption of this text represents significant progress for passenger rights in Europe, and particularly for disabled people and people with reduced mobility."
"With the adoption of this regulation (which concerns journeys by bus and coach), all modes of transport in the European Union will henceforth be covered by legislation offering rights and guarantees to passengers if their journey is, for instance, cancelled or delayed, or if their luggage is lost and so forth."
"That being said, I regret the fact that this regulation only applies from 250 km, since this effectively excludes three Member States of the European Union (Luxembourg, Malta and Cyprus), but also many journeys, such as Brussels-Amsterdam or Budapest-Vienna."
"Finally, I also deplore the lack of flexibility for 'journeys' in cross-border areas, as this impedes Europeans' mobility."
"In other words, this text is much less ambitious than what we defended in the Conciliation Committee a few months ago and much less ambitious than what I would have wanted for passengers in Europe."
"I voted in favour of this text, not only because it seeks to improve the rights of bus and coach passengers in terms of compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, but also because it emphasises the principle of non-discrimination with regard to people with reduced mobility, who should also have proper access to these modes of transport, which now account for 10% of all passenger land transport in Europe."
"Furthermore, I welcome the fact that, thanks to this text, passenger rights are now protected for all modes of transport."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of giving important new rights to bus and coach passengers."
"I think that we have struck a fair balance between the rights of consumers and the needs of transport providers."
"Today's vote will be particularly important for disabled passengers, who will benefit as a result of today's vote."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, in which the European Parliament expresses its position on protecting the rights of passengers."
"I believe it will contribute towards improving conditions for passengers and will give them more legal clarity in the case of an accident or other unforeseen events."
"At the same time, the enhanced passenger rights in this document will be implemented without imposing a heavy burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Most importantly, the rights enjoyed by bus passengers will be comparable to those in other modes of transport."
"Following troubled negotiations between the Council and Parliament, only today can we finally pass the report drafted by Mr Cancian."
"For me, there was no alternative to voting in favour because this report allows the European Union to insist that the individual Member States bring in legislation on this issue in accordance with the directives of the report, which target greater respect for bus and coach passengers."
"Given that buses are the most commonly used means of transport after the car - and this is a growing trend - Europe has the duty to stand up for its citizens who use these services."
"The report represents a good compromise, and I feel I really must emphasise the fact that proper attention has been given to the rights of disabled persons by requiring greater assistance from bus and coach companies for all disabled persons or persons with reduced mobility."
"The entry into force of this legislation means that citizens will have the right to clear and shared rules on compensation for damage or reimbursements in the event of delays to the scheduled timetable."
"On Tuesday, 15 February 2011, the European Parliament adopted a report which will bring about a long-awaited result, namely, equal rights for passengers in all branches of transport."
"The rights of passengers travelling on regular bus services have been strengthened in relation to the loss of luggage, the loss of personal possessions, death or loss of health, problems which are the carrier's fault and so on. A positive feature of the regulation is that it regulates the rights of passengers throughout the European Union."
"It should be stressed that these fundamental rights incorporate the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"The regulation is intended to ensure access to transport without discrimination."
"It also regulates passengers' responsibilities and the consequences of them neglecting these responsibilities, which may include forfeiting the opportunity to claim compensation."
"In view of the above, I voted in favour of the regulation, which is well-drafted and which completes the set as regards the regulation of passengers' rights in the European Union."
"Today, after two years of difficult negotiations with Member States, the European Parliament voted on adopting an agreement on a regulation which will cover all the rights of passengers using national or cross-border long-distance transport services."
"I voted for this agreement because it contains 12 fundamental rights which are of paramount importance to improving the quality of transport services."
"They concern, in particular, the right of passengers to be kept informed prior to and during their journey and the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility."
"The introduction of these rights will allow us to ensure non-discriminatory access to transport."
"In addition, this report features passenger rights which I regard as very important, namely, compulsory compensation for lost luggage, reimbursement of a certain amount of costs in the event of a passenger's death or physical injury, as well as compensation of up to 50% of the ticket's value, in addition to full reimbursement of the ticket price, if an operator cancels a journey and is therefore unable to honour its transport contract."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which sets out a new set of rights for bus and coach passengers and should enhance the quality of the services on offer to them, putting pressure on transport service providers to clean up their acts when it comes to delays, cancellations and lost or damaged luggage."
"The report also includes key provisions to improve the accessibility of local bus services for disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"in writing. - This regulation is a step in the right direction as it creates an EU set of rights for bus passengers."
"However, except for some basic rights, it applies to regular services equal to, or longer than, 250 km."
"Such a limited scope can hardly be a basis for truly European legislation in the interest of all bus passengers and ALDE cannot support such a deal."
"We also oppose the force majeure clause exempting carriers from the obligation to provide accommodation for passengers in case of cancellations or delays if these are caused by severe weather conditions or major natural disasters, as it can set a precedent for other EU passenger rights legislation."
"Even though this is not a triumph, it is an improvement, especially for travellers with disabilities and reduced mobility."
"We managed to ensure non-discriminatory access conditions, disability-related training for the staff of carriers and terminal authorities who deal directly with passengers and compensation for damage or loss of mobility equipment on all routes, regardless of distance."
"Keeping that in mind, and with a view to creating a harmonised EU set of rights for all passengers, we did not oppose the agreement and abstained in the final vote."
"Until now, only aeroplane, train and boat passengers have been covered by specific legislation."
"From now on, passengers travelling by bus and coach will also have their rights safeguarded."
"Passengers who travel by bus and coach will therefore have rights that are comparable to passengers on other modes of transport."
"The regulation approved by us today provides for assistance and compensation for passengers in the event of accident, cancellation or delay, and for non-discriminatory access for passengers with disabilities."
"The new rules will apply to all scheduled national and cross-border services with itineraries of at least 250 kilometres."
"This represents important progress with regard to defending citizens' rights."
"in writing. - I voted in favour, but I would like to add that bus and coach companies should also have to comply with a requirement to create security and emergency aid systems for international and long-distance routes, because people can be injured during accidents."
"It is also necessary to introduce additional regulations relating to the responsibility of bus companies for the life and health of passengers, including obligatory medical checks on the state of health and wellbeing of bus and coach drivers, who are responsible for the health and safety of passengers."
"Today, we voted in favour of a document which, although not ideal, is still a good compromise and which has helped the Council and the European Parliament reach an agreement."
"This regulation discussing passenger rights lays down rules as regards compensation in the event of an accident or postponement, the treatment of passengers' complaints and the rights of disabled persons."
"Clearly, it is unsatisfactory that the regulation will apply to a distance of 250 km or more."
"In the case of small countries, this could not really be justified, but here we are not just talking about local, but international routes, and therefore I believe that for EU citizens who are travelling, this document will become a guarantee of their rights, with particular attention being paid to the rights of disabled persons."
"I voted in favour of this draft resolution extending the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"This document is the result of a compromise following lengthy negotiations which enhances the implementation of passenger rights without imposing an additional burden on carriers."
"I feel that it is important to ensure that the rights enjoyed by bus passengers are comparable to those in other modes of transport, and that carriers are guaranteed a level playing field."
"While seeking the legalisation of adequate compensation for damage experienced, I agree with the proposal to set limits for compensation which the Member States will have to follow."
"It is particularly important to ensure fair and ample compensation in the event of death, and I therefore believe that the ceilings for such compensation under national law must not be lower than the minimum amounts laid down in the regulation."
"Furthermore, proper operational assistance must be ensured in the event of an accident, providing passengers with the services and items they most need."
"I agree with the provisions of the regulation which give passengers appropriate guarantees should a journey be cancelled or delayed, even providing for additional compensation."
"I welcome the fact that the regulation focuses, in particular, on disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility, and on providing them with the assistance they require while travelling."
"The work carried out in conciliation by Mr Cancian regarding the regulation concerning the rights of passengers has led to the adoption of a European legal framework for the protection of bus and coach passengers to stand alongside the creation of a single transport market."
"Until now, the legal vacuum left regulation up to national laws to the detriment of competition (given the various differences) and to the detriment of disabled citizens and/or citizens with reduced mobility, whose rights are now guaranteed by the European Union."
"I voted in favour of the report because I think it is a great piece of work which, by striking a good compromise, forces European transport policies to move forward decisively, not only by guaranteeing the rights of passengers, but also by not overburdening the transport enterprises that provide this service."
"The motion for a resolution on the draft regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport significantly improves passengers' rights."
"Despite negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council lasting several months, the final compromise text makes provision for a series of rights for bus and coach passengers travelling 250 km or more, rather than the 500 km initially put forward by the Council."
"Within four years, which is the deadline for the application of this particular provision, Greek bus and coach passengers and their partners will be able to claim compensation for delays, cancellations or unwarranted timetable changes."
"It is only right and proper that such rights should be safeguarded, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report."
"I voted in favour of this report on the rights of bus and coach passengers."
"I welcome the fact that the final text constitutes a satisfactory and balanced compromise, since it succeeds in guaranteeing the rights of passengers without simultaneously imposing a heavy burden on carriers, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The Commission's proposal to implement EU-wide passenger protection rights comparable to those applicable to other modes of transport, as well as ensuring a level playing field for competition between transport companies in different Member States and between different modes of transport, is a measure that can benefit everyone."
"The negotiations were long and ended in a conciliation process, the main impasses within which were national enforcement bodies and the scope of the regulation."
"In the end, the regulation is to apply to all regular national or cross-border services, provided that the scheduled distance travelled is equal to or greater than 250 km ('long distance')."
"The regulation also provides for compensation and assistance in the event of an accident, passengers' rights in the event of cancellation or delay, and the rights of people with disabilities and/or reduced mobility."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the final text of the regulation, as approved by the Conciliation Committee, represents a balanced compromise which ensures adequate protection for bus and coach passengers, recognising an important set of rights for them, specifically in the event of accident, cancellation or delay, with regard to access to information and the submission and treatment of complaints, and with regard to the needs of people with disabilities and people with reduced mobility."
"I abstained on this regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport, which was adopted by a large majority of socialists and conservatives."
"I regret the considerable step backwards from the position initially adopted by this House, on three main points. 1."
"Only distances greater than 250 km will be covered."
"In practice, people travelling by coach from Brussels to Amsterdam will not be protected whereas those travelling by air will be!"
"This is unjust, especially when we know that it is often the least well off who use this mode of transport. 2."
"The force majeure clause (adverse weather conditions or natural disasters) can be invoked all too easily by coach companies to avoid paying compensation to passengers in the event of a delay or cancellation. 3."
"The derogations will allow countries that so wish to postpone the entry into force of this regulation until 2021!"
"Nonetheless I welcome the advances of the text: compulsory assistance to disabled people and people with reduced mobility, and rights and compensation in the event of an accident, delay or cancellation."
"Parliament has, however, settled for a cut-price, poorly drawn-up agreement."
"The many exceptions and derogations will mean that the scope of these rights will be considerably limited, to the detriment of coach passengers."
"Today, this House voted on the report on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"In December 2008, the Commission tabled a proposal for a regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"Through this proposal, the Commission set itself the target of establishing, at European Union-level, rights that would protect passengers comparable to those applied to other means of transport, as well ensuring equal conditions of competition between the carriers in the various Member States and between the various means of transport."
"The main points that led to an agreement during the Conciliation Committee are: scope, time derogations, compensation and assistance in the event of accidents, rights of passengers in the event of cancellations or delays, and rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"The final text can be considered very satisfying and well-balanced, since it succeeds in guaranteeing passenger rights without simultaneously imposing heavy burdens on carriers, which are mostly small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The result of the conciliation procedure must be seen as a victory for Parliament."
"I am glad that the negotiations between Parliament and the Member States have finally culminated in the adoption of a regulation guaranteeing enhanced rights for passengers travelling by bus or coach."
"This regulation fills a void with respect to the legislation on passenger rights: there was no European legislation on this matter until now, in contrast with the situation for the air and rail sectors."
"This text provides for, among other things, the introduction of several types of compensation: snacks and refreshments if the delay is more than 90 minutes; the cost of one night's accommodation in the event of an interrupted journey, accident or delay requiring an overnight stay; and an upper limit in terms of refund of at least EUR 1 200 in the event of loss of, or damage to, luggage left in the company's care."
"In addition, specific rights have been granted to disabled passengers, not least the requirement for companies to provide them with assistance - provided they have been informed of the person's needs with 36 hours' notice - and the payment of compensation or a refund for any specialised equipment that is damaged or lost."
"This regulation will apply to all long-distance (250 km or more) regular, national or cross-border services from spring 2013 onwards."
"in writing. - The Council, under the Belgian Presidency, weakened considerably Parliament's position as adopted at first and second reading."
"The scope of the regulation is fixed as services for a minimum distance of 250 km, i.e. most bus services will not be included."
"There is also the formulation on reimbursement in case of delay (at least 2 hours, with half of the ticket price to be reimbursed - compare rail transport with reimbursement from 1 hour's delay)."
"Finally, the rights for PRMs are narrowed and weakened and barrier-free access to bus services is not guaranteed."
"In consequence, we voted against."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which finally recognises and protects the rights of travellers on all means of transport, thereby putting users at the centre of transport policy."
"Greater protection of the rights of passengers helps incentivise the use of public transport and favours healthy competition between operators, prompting them to develop more competitive services."
"It is important to emphasise that the new regulation will be applied in complete accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Two important new developments are the provision for monetary compensation in the event of personal injury or damage or loss of luggage and the guarantee of assistance in the event of delays or travel disruptions, which will be based on the model used for trains and aeroplanes."
"The final text recognises and protects passengers, paying particular attention to passengers with reduced mobility and disabled persons by guaranteeing appropriate information and services."
"It is also important to emphasise that there will be no additional costs for businesses in the sector, which are protected from the risk of unbearable adjustment costs, thereby ensuring a fair balance between passenger rights and guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Through this regulation, the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport are at last recognised in law."
"Despite the fact that the Commission proposed this regulation in 2008, only now has a decent compromise been struck so that the only mode of transport that still did not have rules to protect passengers now does."
"Particular attention has been paid to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility."
"The only contentious point of the text was the scope of the rules, which are only applicable to journeys in excess of 250 km."
"Assistance in the event of delays will include an obligation to provide meals, drinks and alternative transport."
"If a service is suspended, the passenger shall not only be reimbursed but, where necessary, will also be provided with overnight accommodation for up to two nights."
"Loss or damage of luggage can be compensated by up to a maximum of EUR 1 200."
"I voted against the report under discussion today concerning the rights of coach passengers because I believe that it does not take all the Member States of the European Union into account, and leaves a large number of coach services out of the scope of the directive."
"250 km is clearly too large a distance, since it completely excludes Malta, Cyprus and Luxembourg."
"Most Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Danish, Dutch and Belgian coach services are also excluded."
"Unfortunately, I must admit that, during the conciliation procedure, the Estonian Government supported an even longer distance of 500 km, which would have excluded Estonia entirely."
"I hope that the day is not far off when the Estonian Government will stand up for coach passengers' rights, instead of the profits of the coach companies, as the directive makes its way through the legislative process."
"in writing. - (NL) This is the fourth package on the protection of passenger rights."
"Following schemes establishing passenger rights in air, rail and water transport, we have now turned to the rights of bus passengers."
"From now on, they will receive compensation in the case of delays to journeys of more than 250 km, assistance if their travel arrangements are cancelled, protection in the case of accidents and fatalities, as well as reimbursement for lost or damaged items."
"Passengers with reduced mobility will also be entitled to special assistance, as is already the case with airlines."
"The European Parliament's position at first and second reading was watered down considerably in the eventual outcome."
"Parliament wanted to apply the rules to journeys of more than 50 km."
"The Council wanted them to only apply to journeys of more than 500 km."
"The compromise was 250 km."
"That means that they do not apply to many current routes, such as Brussels-Amsterdam, Luxembourg-Strasbourg or Vienna-Budapest."
"What is positive, however, is that this legislation provides a list of 12 basic rules - valid for any distance - which are focused on the needs of disabled people and other individuals with reduced mobility."
"Nevertheless, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is extremely disappointed with the very poor result."
"Therefore, together with the rest of the Greens, I voted against this agreement."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which aims to provide passengers travelling by bus or coach with more rights, including the right of assistance for disabled passengers and those with reduced mobility."
"Protecting consumers is a key priority of the Labour Party in Europe."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, particularly because of the advances it introduces to help disabled people and people with reduced mobility, to promote the lodging and processing of complaints, and to promote compensation and assistance in the event of an accident."
"Nonetheless, I would stress the urgent need to ensure that Member States strictly comply with the provisions relating to passenger rights in the event of a cancellation or delay, in order to prevent the many abuses observed in the application of the regulation on the rights of passengers travelling by air."
"in writing. - (PT) The main objective of the European Commission's proposal is to ensure that bus and coach passengers have the same rights as for other modes of transport, as well as ensuring a level playing field for competition between carriers in the different Member States and different modes of transport."
"Despite disagreements during the course of the process, I welcome the fact that this regulation has been adopted, as it will enable the rights of bus and coach passengers to be safeguarded without placing too many burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises that operate within this sector."
"This regulation provides for a set of basic rights, of which I would highlight the special attention paid to people with reduced mobility and people with disabilities, and the right to compensation and assistance in the event of accident, cancellation or delay."
"These rights apply to all regular national and cross-border services, provided that the distance travelled is equal to or greater than 250 km."
"Passengers who travel for part of these long-distance journeys are also covered."
"A series of rights provided for passengers on short-distance regular services has also been established, in particular, non-discriminatory access to transport and the right to information while travelling."
"The regulation on the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport is an excellent example of how the European Parliament demonstrates its concern for consumer rights."
"Following difficult negotiations with the European Council, we have adopted a text which deals with the final means of transport for which passengers' rights had not yet been regulated under EU law."
"At the start of the negotiations, Parliament demanded that new regulations be introduced for journeys of over 50 km, whereas the Council wanted a distance of over 500 km."
"By way of a compromise, the distance was set at over 250 km."
"Passengers travelling on such routes will be granted a number of concessions and rights, similar to those granted to passengers travelling by air."
"EU legislation clearly regulates the rights I have if my luggage is lost at an airport or a plane's take-off is delayed for a long time."
"Until now, bus and coach passengers were in a much worse situation."
"Today, among other things, they will be able to demand compensation for delays or damage to luggage, while persons of reduced mobility will receive a special escort."
"The creation of a Charter of Passengers' Rights will mean that citizens will be more aware of what they can expect from carriers."
"The Charter will comprise a collection of fundamental rights to which every passenger is entitled, regardless of the distance they are travelling."
"This is an example of good, citizen-focused legislation."
"This regulation allows us to strengthen consumers' rights and the common market, and so I voted in favour of its adoption."
"I voted for the regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport."
"It establishes rights for passengers using bus and coach transport, which are comparable to those that apply to all other modes of transport."
"The regulation applies to all regular services, both national and cross-border, covering a minimum scheduled distance of 250 km."
"These rights concern non-discriminatory access to transport for persons with disabilities, as well as awarding compensation in the event of the passenger's death, physical injury or of loss of, or damage to, luggage."
"If a journey is cancelled or delayed for more than 120 minutes, passengers will be offered immediately the option either to re-route their journey to their final destination at no extra cost or to be reimbursed the price of their ticket."
"If the carrier does not offer this option, passengers are entitled to compensation amounting to up to 50% of the ticket value, in addition to the reimbursement of the ticket price."
"Where a journey of more than three hours is cancelled or delayed by more than 90 minutes, the carrier must offer assistance and hotel accommodation of up to EUR 80 per night, per passenger, for a maximum of two nights."
"I call for passengers to be made sufficiently aware of their rights so that they can claim for failure to respect them."
"It is our duty to ensure that service providers treat passengers properly and that disabled persons do not face obstacles to using transport services."
"It is important to secure a level playing field between carriers from different Member States as well as the various modes of transport."
"We need a well balanced compromise that would ensure passenger rights in all EU Member States, which sometimes vary greatly in terms of size, without, at the same time, imposing a heavy burden on carriers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Most importantly, any new rules should improve the quality of the EU's transport sector and increase competitiveness."
"However, we must not forget the question of road safety."
"In Lithuania, we are particularly dependent on road transport - more than 90% of all travellers use cars."
"Around 8% travel by bus and coach."
"Road safety is a very important issue which has not received enough attention in my opinion."
"According to EU statistics, in Lithuania, there are 110 road deaths per million inhabitants."
"By comparison, in Sweden, there are 39 deaths per million inhabitants."
"In the United Kingdom there are 41."
"This Lithuanian rate is intolerable and much higher than the EU average of 70."
"This must change."
"in writing. - I welcome the report on bus and coach passenger rights as it is an important step in providing greater protection to travellers, as well as in increasing the comfort and ease of disabled passengers."
"The report ensures those travelling on longer-distance coach journeys across Europe have access to better information, support and compensation in case of delay or cancellation of a service."
"Passengers will be entitled to refreshments in the case of short delay, a refund for over 2 hours' delay, and up to EUR 1 200 for lost or damaged luggage."
"I support the important advances this report makes for the rights of disabled travellers."
"For the first time, non-discriminatory access to transport is guaranteed as the regulation states that all bus and coach staff must be trained to help people with disabilities, and where suitable assistance cannot be offered, a passenger may travel free with the disabled person to ensure their comfort."
"This is an important step in uniting Europe against discrimination."
"My vote in favour of this report reflects the need for a European standard of rights for bus and coach passengers that ensures their comfort, safety and fair treatment as they travel across Europe."
"I voted in favour of this resolution, which proposes consistent legislation regarding the rights of passengers in public road transport."
"Specific measures are thus going to be introduced to enhance the legal certainty, rights and information of bus and coach passengers."
"From now on, travellers will enjoy the same compensation guarantees as they enjoy in the rail and aviation sectors, in particular, if their trip is delayed or cancelled."
"This vote is part of the EU's political will to establish common legislation for users of all modes of transport."
"I also welcome the application of measures in favour of disabled people and people with reduced mobility: these measures will facilitate their access to road transport."
"This decision helps remove the obstacles to freedom of movement for those travelling within the European area."
"Finally, a balance has been struck with the proposal of flexible legislation, which will ensure that haulage companies, which are often small businesses, are not penalised."
"In my view, these new measures help promote a mode of transport that is accessible to the greatest number of people, especially in the tourism sector."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Cancian because it finally establishes basic guarantees for the 70 million European citizens who travel by bus or coach each year within Europe and who had been waiting for their rights to be enshrined for some time."
"Irrespective of their chosen means of transport, European citizens will be protected and looked after as a result of the European Commission's commitment to thoroughly revise the existing regulations and to harmonise them in a single law providing common standards for all types of journey as well as specific provisions for the particular method of transport chosen."
"Given that the average reduction in CO2 emissions during the period 2002-2007 for light commercial vehicles was only 0.4-0.5% per year, and that EU targets for new light commercial vehicles are necessary to avoid fragmentation within the internal market, I am voting in favour of this proposal."
"However, it is important to note that light commercial vehicles cannot be compared with passenger cars, and that the proposal of 150 g of CO2/km is ambitious, but feasible."
"I also agree with the possibility of manufacturers forming 'pools' of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, since this has been shown to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers and increase employment within a greener economy, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy."
"I also agree that this question should be addressed in several phases by 2011, and not only in 2014 as the Commission proposes."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, in which the EP endorses a new EU Regulation introducing CO2 limits as of 2014 for light commercial vehicles (LCVs)."
"I believe that new requirements and CO2 limits will help to fight global warming, lower running costs through savings on fuel and boost innovation and the competitiveness of European car manufacturers."
"With these rules, green technologies have to be built into the vehicles which need to stay affordable."
"Starting in 2014, 70% of new commercial vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes must comply with an average emission limit of 175 grams CO2 per kilometre."
"In 2020, the limit will drop to 147 grams."
"It is an ambitious, but feasible, plan."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"At its meeting of 8-9 March 2007, the European Council made a firm commitment to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions of the Community by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020, and by 30% provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute according to their respective capabilities."
"Policies and measures should be implemented at Member State and EU level across all sectors of the EU economy, and not only within the industry and energy sectors, in order to generate the necessary emissions reductions."
"Road transport is the second largest greenhouse gas emitting sector in the EU and its emissions, including those from light commercial vehicles, continue to rise."
"If road transport emissions continue to increase, it will significantly undermine efforts made by other sectors to combat climate change."
"Hitherto in the EU, there has not been legislation regulating CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles, although demand for these vehicles is increasing in the EU."
"I believe we managed to reach agreement with the Council on a balanced document, which will help reduce CO2 emissions and will encourage the automotive sector to invest in new and less-polluting technologies."
"The idea is a noble one: reducing the CO2 emissions of light vehicles."
"However, what is being presented to us as a realistic compromise with the Council is actually a third-rate agreement."
"The approved report limits the average CO2 emissions of new light commercial vehicles to 175 g/km, while the long-term objective is 147 g/km, which will not be achieved until at least 2020."
"That is not enough."
"The European Commission was proposing a limit of 135 g/km, a more ambitious and equally realistic proposal."
"I voted against this report because I regret that we have not reached a compromise bringing us closer to the European Commission's proposal."
"Improvements in energy efficiency and the management of innovation are priorities today, as everyone recognises, but we still need to live up to our words by making ambitious proposals."
"The proposal for a regulation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from light commercial vehicles falls under the Commission's strategic framework to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere."
"However, several graphs in the latest report by the European Environment Agency clearly show that CO2 emissions caused by road transport in the EU-15 and the EU-27 have either been stable or decreasing since 2003."
"In addition, it is worth considering that light commercial vehicles are responsible for only approximately 1.5% of carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector."
"The lengthy and difficult negotiations held in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety focused, above all, on the long-term emissions limit, which was agreed at 147g CO2/km."
"This figure, though better than initially proposed, does not fully meet my expectations."
"Indeed, in order to protect industry in the sector, Italy had asked for the level not to fall below 160g CO2/km and, in the Council, many Member States seemed to be moving towards an agreement for a minimum threshold of 155g CO2/km."
"In conclusion, I think that the result reached in the trialogue between the Commission, the Council and Parliament on reducing long-term CO2 emissions is still out of proportion with the special characteristics of the automotive sector and I should like to express my concern about the risk of damaging the industry and employment levels in the sector."
"Light commercial vehicles are mainly used by businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Currently, light commercial vehicles make up around 12% of the fleet."
"We must also recognise that these vehicles are often bought by fleet buyers in large quantities, and therefore are already closely judged on their efficiency and running costs."
"The average reduction in CO2 emissions over 2002-2007 for light commercial vehicles amounted to 0.4-0.5% per year, and these improvements in fuel efficiency have been offset by the increase in demand for transport and vehicle size."
"Therefore, adopting Community-wide targets for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent fragmentation in the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures at Member State level."
"Furthermore, setting CO2 emission standards for new light commercial vehicles is necessary to prevent a risk of regulatory gap resulting from a degree of overlap between the registrations for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work so far."
"I appreciate the essence of this text, which aims to contribute to the European Union's aim of reducing CO2 emissions through producing better functioning light commercial vehicles as well."
"However, it is well-known that these transport methods are used almost exclusively for commercial reasons and therefore, compared with passenger cars, there is less scope to modify their shape or mass."
"As long as it is understood that the best way to achieve this - as the rapporteur notes - is through modifications to engines and mechanics, I do support the agreement reached on the timescale for the implementation of these changes."
"I think the initial, short-term objective of reaching 175g CO2/km between 2014 and 2017 is indeed quite reasonable, while further reducing emissions to 147 CO2/km can logically be achieved by 2020."
"On the one hand, it is understandable that the proposal is largely based on the legislation on CO2 emissions from cars, but on the other hand, we should bear in mind that this sector does not operate in the same way."
"Vans have a longer development and production cycle, and are used mainly for commercial purposes, and in contrast to cars, there are fewer options for modifying their shape and weight to reduce emissions."
"The main way to achieve this with vans is to modify the engine and mechanics of the vehicle, which is a far longer and more costly process than a simple change to the bodywork."
"The fact that vans make much wider use of diesel as a fuel also plays an important role."
"I have reservations about the proposal that sanctions against producers who fail to reduce the CO2 emissions of vans should be higher than sanctions for failing to reduce emissions from cars."
"In my opinion, the sanctions should be the same in both areas."
"I understand the reasons for introducing mandatory speed limiters for vans, but I am concerned that this might set a precedent for the introduction of speed limiters for other types of vehicle."
"We must think carefully about whether this is not an excessively restrictive regulation, going beyond the framework of proportionality."
"The Sustainable Development strategy addresses the most pressing sustainable development problems, such as transport, climate change, public health and energy conservation."
"The road transport sector is the second highest emitter of greenhouse gases within the Union and its emissions, including those from light commercial vehicles, are continuing to increase."
"If emissions within this sector continue to increase, this increase will significantly compromise the efforts made by other sectors to combat climate change."
"It is important to advance technologically and promote eco-innovation, taking account of future technological development for the increased long-term competitiveness of the European car industry and the creation of more quality jobs."
"In recognition of high research and development costs, and in order to increase the competitiveness of the European automotive industry, incentive regimes should be applied, such as compensation for eco-innovations and the granting of super-credits."
"I think that this draft regulation is based upon the premise that lowering the fuel consumption of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) will reduce the overall level of CO2 emissions from transport, thereby mitigating climate change and setting CO2 emission limits for new LCVs in the European Union."
"I voted in favour of the report on emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles, which comes in the wake of the EU strategy to reduce emissions from light vehicles."
"This report includes measures - such as super-credits for non-polluting or low emission vehicles, fines if limits are exceeded and eco-innovation incentives to help manufacturers develop new, more environmentally friendly technologies - which will benefit the competitiveness of the EU and create employment opportunities."
"Now that the debate on CO2 emissions has become unavoidable, since it is central to the discussion on climate change, it is important to find solutions for the necessary reduction in emissions of light commercial vehicles."
"The aim of approving EU targets for new light commercial vehicles is to avoid fragmentation of the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures by Member States."
"As the rapporteur points out, this new regulation will also serve as an incentive for the automotive sector to invest in new technologies."
"The road transport sector is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the European Union and its emissions are continuing to rise."
"Consequently, all types of vehicles must be covered by regulations to reduce these emissions, including light commercial vehicles."
"The objective of reducing greenhouse gases will be achieved more easily if there is EU legislation, instead of national legislation with different objectives."
"In addition, we will have greater legal security and certainty for the motor vehicle manufacturing sector."
"However, we have to combine ambition with realism and common sense."
"Therefore, and knowing that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that mainly use light commercial vehicles, and that these make up more than 99.8% of companies in the EU and 67.4% of jobs, we cannot set targets that would put them at a disadvantage."
"Therefore, I agree with the emissions limit objective of 147 g CO2/km for new light commercial vehicles registered in the EU, provided that the viability of this option is confirmed."
"I also welcome the fact that a single European speed limit has not been introduced for this type of vehicle."
"We are in favour of the development and application of technologies that reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and, therefore, the levels of atmospheric gas emissions resulting from their combustion."
"This is for reasons of environmental quality and the health and wellbeing of people, and for reasons connected to the progressive and inexorable worldwide shortage of fossil fuel reserves, which must be managed extremely wisely and prudently."
"This approach is also inseparable from the focus on modes of transport that do not rely on this form of energy, such as rail, which requires investment to secure its development."
"In this specific case, we believe that the emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles must not ignore either the diversity of the automotive manufacturers or the legitimate interests and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in the various Member States."
"The discussion of this dossier has shown that there are various possibilities for limiting vehicle emissions, with inherent investment costs and also different application horizons, which must be carefully evaluated."
"These different possibilities include the introduction of speed limiters in vehicles, which, apart from reducing emissions, may also have positive implications for road safety."
"I have abstained today, because I was not able to support the compromise that has been negotiated."
"It falls short of what is needed and 147 grams is not a sufficiently ambitious long-term target."
"However, I have not voted against the report, because the compromise will be implemented quickly and will enable the necessary innovations to be introduced rapidly."
"Strict environmental standards will not harm the industry."
"On the contrary, only challenging targets will generate the necessary pressure to innovate and this is the only way in which our industry will remain at the cutting edge."
"The watering down of the long-term target in particular demonstrates to me that the automotive industry has not learnt from the legislation on CO2 limits for cars introduced two years ago that it will only be able to sell clean cars in the future."
"The car industry does not seem to credit its customers with much common sense."
"Instead of research into new technologies, the industry has put all its efforts into combating the proposed regulations."
"It has exploited every single line of defence and has shown no inclination to take part in constructive cooperation."
"This is disappointing."
"In addition, we have once again missed the chance of making it clear that by protecting our industry in this way, we are not doing it any good."
"The future is calling, but we are not listening."
"Only yesterday, VW presented its 1 litre car at the Detroit Motor Show, which shows just what is possible."
"The adoption of the Commission's proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles seems to me, more than anything, to be a gamble on the future."
"The compromise reached on limiting average CO2 emissions to 147 g/km by 2020 does not meet the initial ambitions of my fellow Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who had previously advocated a decidedly more ambitious objective (135 g/km)."
"They were supported in this by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left."
"Behind this 'battle of numbers', however, there is a balance to be struck between the environmental challenges that everyone recognises and certain social and industrial requirements which must not be forgotten."
"That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives."
"Not only will this revision allow us to return to this subject quickly and to go further in the fight against vehicle pollution, but it will also be an opportunity to address the issue of EU research and innovation in the field of road haulage."
"The date is set for 2012."
"In order to respond to the European Union's ambitious objectives in terms of sustainable development and combating climate change, it is important that the European Union takes action in the vehicle sector."
"In this regard, the adoption of this report is a further step forward towards the manufacture of vehicles which pollute less."
"However, I very much regret the lack of ambition in this regulation in relation to the reduction of CO2 emissions for new light commercial vehicles."
"While I did, of course, vote in favour of this resolution, what I voted for was the European Commission's initial proposal: namely, an objective of 135 g CO2/km by 2014 and 120 g CO2/km by 2020 (rather than what was eventually adopted: 175 g CO2/km by 2014 and 147 g CO2/km by 2020)."
"Today, technology is available that would allow us to achieve much lower thresholds, and to do so much more quickly than is envisaged by the objectives in this report."
"Reducing the CO2 emissions of all forms of transport, including small commercial vehicles, is a desirable objective."
"It is important to set limits in order to encourage vehicle manufacturers to take an ambitious approach."
"The agreement on the limits is due, among other things, to the negotiating skills of the Belgian Presidency."
"This compromise includes the short-term goal of reducing emissions to 175 grams per kilometre by 2014."
"In addition, there will be a gradual, step-by-step reduction in order to achieve a long-term target of 147 grams per kilometre by 2020."
"These targets are accompanied by measures which provide incentives for the industry to manufacture energy-efficient commercial vehicles."
"Achieving these targets will not only benefit the small and medium-sized companies which are the main users of vans and delivery trucks, but also private individuals and, most importantly, the environment."
"In future, we will be able to play our part not only at EU level, but also on the world market, if we can produce safe and clean vehicles."
"In addition, we must not allow our expertise to be exported to other countries, such as China, as a result of delays in EU policy making."
"Instead, we must take this as an opportunity to put in place a sustainable European environment policy, which will have a positive impact not only on Europe as an industrial location, but also on employment."
"I welcome this compromise and have therefore supported it."
"I agreed with the provision that just as the passenger car sector is making strides towards reduced emissions, so should the light commercial vehicle sector."
"Manufacturers would thus place new vehicles with improved CO2 emissions performance on the market."
"This would enable users to upgrade their fleets and lower their contribution to transport's 'CO2 footprint'."
"The purpose of this proposed legislation is to reduce the CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles."
"This is harder to do than with cars, because the bodies of LCVs cannot be so readily or cheaply altered to make them more efficient."
"All changes must be made to the engines or mechanics instead."
"This is quite a major investment."
"Nevertheless, it is questionable whether this proposal will accomplish this aim: There are significant concerns as to whether the measures will meet the original goal of preventing climate change and whether the targets and timetable proposed are realistic and feasible economically."
"There is also concern that they may reduce competitiveness in this sector."
"I nevertheless feel that we should give more consideration to three areas: the economic downturn and its severe impact on car manufacturers and users, the need to support industry (manufacturers) rather than disadvantaging it with onerous measures (or even fines), and the need to support business (users) rather than inducing additional costs via questionable political measures."
"During the legislative process, I tabled numerous amendments to the proposal for a regulation concerning emissions from new light commercial vehicles, aimed at relaxing the CO2 emission levels initially put forward, and at ensuring that a longer period would be provided for achieving the targets."
"I am glad to see that my amendments were taken into consideration."
"I believe that the regulation as it was voted through will help to reduce CO2 emissions."
"Industry has been given the opportunity to adapt its designs and to introduce appropriate regulations within the prescribed timeframe."
"N1 vehicles are used by small businesses which are sensitive to price increases, and which are, at the same time, becoming ever more common on the market."
"The regulation will not burden them with excessive costs."
"The regulation provides for rewards in the form of credits for the best manufacturers which meet the goals for emissions standards ahead of time."
"Companies which do not manage to adapt in time risk facing fines, which it will not be possible to pass on to consumers."
"I voted in favour of adopting the resolution."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal laying out higher emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles."
"This should make an important contribution to improving the quality of air in city centres in particular."
"Two years ago, legislation on car emissions was approved."
"It is now time for the European Parliament to approve the introduction of CO2 limits for new light commercial vehicles."
"These vehicles are mainly used by companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, and make up approximately 12% of the vehicles on the road at the moment."
"Apart from contributing to improved air quality and to achieving the EU climate targets, the vehicles should provide greater fuel savings for the small companies that depend on them."
"The objectives indicated aim to encourage innovation in the industry."
"The regulation sets a target of 175 g CO2/km to be implemented by 2014, which should gradually fall to 147 g CO2/km by 2020."
"The sanctions to be applied if manufacturers fail to comply with this regulation must be scrupulously fulfilled."
"In order to be able to achieve a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, manufacturers need to redesign vehicles so that they do not exceed a specific level in future."
"The measures which seem technically feasible in the case of cars may not necessarily be achievable for light commercial vehicles."
"As it is not really possible to change the shape of the vehicles, the engineers will have to focus on the engine and the mechanical components, which, according to the experts, is a long-winded process."
"For this reason, we need to find alternative solutions which will lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles."
"There are currently two possible options."
"One is to increase the reduction for cars, in order to compensate for the emissions from commercial vehicles."
"The other is to fit a speed limiter, which would also result in a significant fall in emissions."
"I did not vote in favour of the report because, in my opinion, it offers too few options."
"We must aim to reduce the level of CO2 emissions as much as possible, and therefore it is very important to set an emissions target for vehicles given their negative impact on the environment and human health."
"However, the proposal put forward in the resolution to raise the emissions target for new light commercial vehicles, setting the same target that is applied to cars, is primarily being debated due to the measures envisaged to achieve this objective and their impact on van manufacturers."
"The proposal to install speed limiters in cars would have a negative impact on businesses and would reduce their competitiveness in the international market."
"Furthermore, van manufacturers would have to increase their prices, given the costs endured."
"Therefore, before taking such important decisions, we should carry out extensive scientific research, proving that the introduction of speed limiters would significantly reduce the level of CO2 emissions."
"We must also create a clear and adequate credit mechanism and outline promotional initiatives."
"I believe that in order to increase the competitiveness of European car manufacturers, greater attention should be paid to stimulus measures."
"The aims to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles are important aspects of the European strategy for combating pollution and climate change."
"Pollution from light commercial vehicles is minimal compared with the overall transport category, but each specific sector needs limits that will allow the pre-established objectives to be reached, so therefore, I voted in favour of the report."
"Europe's objective is to reduce CO2 emissions to 120g CO2/km in order to progressively reduce average emissions, so I agree with the structure of the regulation, which, from January 2014, requires newly registered and manufactured light commercial vehicles to produce less than 175g CO2/km in emissions and, in the long term (by 2020) to produce less than 147g CO2/km, partly so as to reach a compromise given the requirements for designing these vehicles."
"I voted in favour of the present report on new legislation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles."
"My decision was based on the various data presented in the different documents informing the argument, in particular, the fact that at the moment, these vehicles make up approximately 12% of the vehicles on the road."
"It is necessary to set CO2 emission standards for new light commercial vehicles in order to avoid regulatory gaps, and it is also important to encourage the automotive sector to invest in new technologies."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he highlights the need for the light commercial vehicle sector to follow the example of the car sector, which is trying to reduce CO2 emissions."
"However, unlike cars, changes to these vehicles do not involve their shape or weight, but modifications to their engines and mechanics, which makes the process much slower and more expensive."
"Nevertheless, it is important to encourage this technological progress to the benefit of all."
"in writing. - This proposal is a follow-up to the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles (LCVs), as follows:"
"from 2020, a long-tem target of 147g CO2/km for the average emissions of new LCVs registered in the Union, subject to confirmation of its feasibility."
"By 1 January 2013, after a complete review of them, a proposal will amend it, if appropriate;"
"the short-term target, fixed to 175g CO2/km; a phasing-in period from 1 January 2014 onwards with full compliance of the new fleet from 2017;"
"specific emission targets for alternative fuel vehicles will be incorporated, aimed at promoting further deployment of certain alternative fuel vehicles in the Union market;"
"for multi-stage vehicles, the specific emissions of CO2 of completed vehicles will be allocated to the manufacturer of the base vehicle."
"The super-credits to manufacturers producing LCVs with emissions of CO2 of less than 50g CO2/km will be limited with a threshold of 25 000 LCVs per manufacturer;"
"the penalties: from 2019 onwards settled to €95, being phased in gradually from 1 January 2014 to 2018."
"Helping manufactures to develop green technology for vans will be beneficial both for companies and job creation."
"There can be no exceptions: commercial vehicles will also have to go green."
"I voted in favour of this proposal for a directive which requires manufacturers to reduce the CO2 emissions of vans and other commercial vehicles within the next decade."
"This proposal largely takes its inspiration from the European regulation on the CO2 emissions of cars, which has been in force since 2008."
"This was a reasonable vote, following an agreement with the Council which essentially returns to the main proposals of the European Commission: the obligation to reduce the polluting emissions of commercial vehicles to 175 g CO2/km by 2014 for 100% of the fleet, and to reduce them progressively to 147 g CO2/km by 2020."
"Nevertheless, this is still a bit of a disappointment, as we had voted for a more ambitious objective in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in September 2010."
"As for the extra costs to manufacturers of vans and minibuses, they will be well compensated for by the fact that these vehicles will pollute less and consume less, and in the end, that is what motorists are interested in."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Callanan."
"We have today adopted the agreement reached with governments of the Member States over new limits on CO2 emissions for European commercial vehicles, which also includes incentives for industry to produce vans that are more energy efficient and penalties for those who do not respect the new rules."
"The legislation adopted represents a difficult balancing act and sets a series of ambitious but feasible environmental objectives for manufacturers."
"The new legislation completes the European regulatory framework, adding to the rules on passenger vehicle emissions set out two years ago."
"If manufacturers produce a van with emissions of lower than 50g CO2/km then they will be awarded a super-credit, valid for a limited period of time."
"Indeed, said vehicle would count towards the calculation of the average as 3.5 vehicles between 2014-2015, 2.5 in 2016 and 1.5 in 2017, which is the last year that the super-credit system will be in place."
"On the other hand, newly manufactured vehicles that emit more than the imposed limits will, from 2019 onwards, be subject to a penalty of up to EUR 95 per gram."
"in writing. - Despite voting against the report in committee (32/25/0) the Greens/EFA agreed with the other groups that negotiations for first-reading agreement with the Council should be sought, mainly due to an assessment that political majorities are not likely to improve at plenary and negotiations with the forthcoming Hungarian and Polish presidencies would be unlikely to yield a better result."
"The main content of the first-reading agreement was: delaying the binding 175 g CO2/km average limit by one year (2017); lowering the 2020 target to 147 g/km, requiring to be confirmed by legislative procedure; lowering excess emissions premium to EUR 95/g; and a slight increase and prolongation of super-credits until 2017."
"However, the final outcome in plenary was highly unsatisfactory, and we decided to vote against."
"I voted in favour of this report as I think it is worthwhile to pursue the aim of protecting the environment."
"This is an important document that helps the automotive industry to plan their manufacturing more effectively, thereby ensuring reduced CO2 emissions."
"This decision will stimulate innovation and research, helping both consumers and, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises to make savings."
"At the conclusion of the long negotiations between Parliament and the Council, an important result was reached that is the fruit of a balanced compromise between the different positions of the 27 Member States."
"The adoption of these new targets and standards will certainly produce tangible results, while also better protecting the health of all European citizens."
"The fight against climate change cannot be delayed and this applies equally to reducing vehicle emissions."
"Today, I voted for the report under discussion concerning emissions standards for new light commercial vehicles."
"I believe that the report is necessary in view of European Union objectives relating to global warming and emission reduction."
"Equally, it should be noted that as the light commercial vehicles in question provide a service and are used mainly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it is important that their capacities are also taken into account when implementing any necessary changes."
"I sincerely believe that, in order to achieve the level imposed by this report, we need an appropriate compromise taking account of the SMEs operating in Europe and the global aims of the European Union."
"in writing. - (NL) I fully supported the initial proposal for the establishment of CO2 emission standards for new light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in order to prevent a loophole resulting from the certain amount of overlap that currently exists between passenger car and LCV registration."
"Currently, many vehicles that are homologated as passenger cars, such as SUVs, are registered as LCVs, often because this latter category is subject to reduced taxation or because of other fiscal incentives."
"Although the legislation covering passenger cars (like this proposal) is based on type approval of vehicles (rather than registration), the absence of regulation for LCVs means that there is a risk that manufacturers of relatively large passenger cars will apply for LCV type approval."
"This would mean that these high-emitting vehicles would remain outside the scope of CO2 emission standards."
"Ultimately, the first reading agreement has turned into a very weak agreement, where the binding target to achieve 175 g CO2/km has been delayed by a year."
"The 2020 target has been left at 147 g/km and the penalties for non-compliance have been reduced from EUR 120/g to EUR 95/g."
"This is an inadequate token gesture that will mean that this law will fail to make any significant contribution to the climate debate."
"The sense of urgency has disappeared, that much is clear."
"Hence, my 'no' vote."
"in writing. - I have supported this report which is part of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles."
"By helping manufacturers to develop green technology, we can benefit companies and also create jobs whilst helping to tackle the environmental problems that we are facing."
"The conclusion of the Sustainable Development strategy, initiated by the Commission, emphasises the most urgent problems of sustainable development, namely, energy efficiency measures in the transport sector."
"Bearing in mind the fight against climate change with regard to CO2 emissions and the increased competitiveness of the European automotive industry, this regulation aims to establish incentive schemes, in particular, the granting of super-credits and payments for eco-innovations and also fewer penalties."
"The agreement reached by Parliament in this respect is ambitious, but also feasible at the same time."
"The phased, short-term EU target is 175 g CO2/km, to be reached by 2017, and the long-term target is 147 g CO2/km, to be achieved by 2020."
"At the same time, it provides super-credits for vehicles that meet the efficiency criteria and applies reasonable penalties if the maximum CO2 limits are exceeded."
"I believe that approval of this regulation is in keeping with the environmental sustainability policies of the European Union and, at the same time, safeguards manufacturers, most of which are small and medium-sized enterprises, and users, and also promotes innovation in the sector."
"I voted for the proposal for a regulation setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the European Commission's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles."
"This will allow us to encourage vehicle manufacturers to use eco-innovation to ensure the European car industry's competitiveness."
"The regulation imposes the payment of penalties on light commercial vehicle manufacturers for exceeding the average specific emissions defined in it."
"I would like to point out that the restriction on polluting emissions must not only be approached from the supply angle, for instance, how light-duty vehicles need to be modernised to be made cleaner, but also from the demand angle."
"It is important that new vehicles which comply with this regulation's provisions are accessible to consumers."
"This will enable the regulation both to provide incentives for the production of vehicles offering efficient fuel consumption and to impose penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet the agreed targets."
"From 1 January 2012, it will be the duty of each Member State to record every year the details of every new light commercial vehicle registered in their country and to ensure compliance with this regulation's provisions."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report today as it signals another step in the right direction in the fight against climate change."
"CO2 limits for new vans will lead to cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles in the EU."
"Targets have been set and incentives for more efficient vans will hopefully kick-start an innovation drive across the industry."
"This should give companies, including many small businesses in Wales who rely on these vans, an opportunity to use more fuel-efficient vans and control costs at a time of rising oil prices."
"I have not voted in favour of Mr Callanan's report, despite the fact that it is well-founded and represents a move in the right direction."
"However, I am of the opinion that the CO2 emission limits per kilometre should be much more ambitious."
"Therefore, I support the Commission's proposal of 135 grams of CO2 per kilometre."
"The combination of emission pools, which manufacturers can create across their entire product range, and a speed limit of 120 km/h, would make this target achievable, although it would require serious efforts to be made."
"At the same time, we should not allow any of these deadlines to be postponed for the sake of the environment."
"We should stick with 2014."
"Bearing in mind the protracted development of this issue, starting with the Commission's proposal for a regulation in 2000, its subsequent approval by Parliament in 2002, the initial results of serious difficulties with its acceptance by Member States, the conclusions of the Council in 2009, the non-transposition of its position, the insurmountable problems in the negotiation rounds in December 2010, and the subsequent commitment of a minimum number of Member States to institute enhanced cooperation in this field, despite it not being the exclusive competence of the EU, I approve the present recommendation."
"I agree with this proposal for a regulation, since a lack of unitary patent protection throughout the EU may lead to a fragmented, complex and expensive patent system."
"Since all the requirements are met, this can only bring with it advantages for the internal market."
"Over recent months, I have repeatedly expressed my disapproval of a trilingual language regime for patents."
"Even more, I think that the use of the European institution of enhanced cooperation to circumvent Italy's and Spain's veto, and thereby avoid continuing the debate to find a shared, less burdensome solution, is an issue of unprecedented political gravity."
"This proposal for a decision is also incompatible with the requirement of last resort set forth by Article 20(2) of the Treaty on European Union, which establishes that enhanced cooperation can only be permitted when, all other options having been examined, there is no possibility of reaching the objectives within a reasonable period."
"Additionally, more than a year after the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of the equal standing of the European languages is already being cast aside, compromising the competitiveness and innovative qualities of millions of European small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the rights of European citizens."
"This patent regime harms the internal market, subjecting it to geographical segmentation, which would be an obstacle to trade between Member States and have a negative impact on the stability of enterprises and the free movement of capital."
"As I reiterate my opposition, I would say that I think it would have been a good idea to wait for the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on 8 March before discussing the issue in this House."
"Europe is making progress."
"Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, it is now possible for a group of countries who want to move forward together on a particular subject to do so even if some countries are not interested."
"This is already the case for the rules applicable to binational couples who wish to divorce."
"We call this 'enhanced cooperation'."
"I wanted the same to apply to the protection of European inventions, and I wanted enhanced cooperation to be used to create a European patent."
"The reason is that, while it costs 10 times as much to protect inventions with a patent in Europe as it does in the United States, in particular, because of translation costs, 25 of the 27 Member States want to create a European patent together; such a patent would cost less because it would be unitary."
"The unitary patent will be filed in French, English or German and will protect our inventions in the 25 countries involved."
"Furthermore, this protection will finally come at an affordable price."
"Even if Spain and Italy are not in favour of such a system for linguistic reasons, it is essential that the 25 Member States who are interested make progress together on this subject."
"I voted in favour of this procedure, as it represents a big step forward for the competitiveness of European industry."
"The creation of unitary patent protection in the European Union is an essential part of developing innovations and improving competitiveness."
"I supported this resolution, which will authorise enhanced cooperation between the Member States in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection."
"Hitherto, there has been a fragmented patent system in the European Union, caused by the high costs and complexity of validating patents in individual Member States."
"Although more than nine Member States have indicated their intention to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, the Commission and the Member States participating should promote the participation of as many Member States as possible."
"Enhanced cooperation would facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market and would eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods, which would increase the number of inventors and would provide access to unitary patent protection throughout the EU."
"A European patent system is a necessity."
"The existence of different interpretations and decisions in each Member State causes legal uncertainty."
"The obligatory translation of each patent file into the 23 official languages is expensive, lengthy and creates a loss of competitiveness."
"Therefore, in general, the overwhelming majority of interested parties, including professional associations, agrees with the 'English-only' option."
"The proposal under discussion picks out three languages (English, French and German), with all the other languages ranking behind."
"In terms of global prominence, however, Portuguese is a much more important language than French or German."
"I also have many reservations about the possibility of using enhanced cooperation in this case."
"An instrument that is intended to allow a group of countries to start processes of greater integration which could progressively include all the others must not be converted into a private club and an exclusion mechanism, or one which establishes the predominance of some over others."
"Therefore, I am against the Lehne report."
"Although I appreciate the spirit of this reform, which aims to provide Europe with a single patent and therefore reduce translation costs, I voted against it in any case."
"The proposal for a decision tabled by the European Council authorises an enhanced cooperation procedure in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection because some Member States, including my own country, were against the adoption of the planned system of translation."
"This would be a trilingual system that would be discriminatory since it violates the principle of equal standing of all the languages of the European Union."
"Furthermore, in my opinion, the enhanced cooperation system would damage the internal market, creating divisions and distortions of competition within it."
"Therefore, it would have been desirable to wait for the decision of the Court of Justice, which is expected in the coming days, and will first of all clear up a number of technical aspects relating to the unitary patent system."
"In my opinion, the fragmentary system of patent protection represents an obstacle in the internal market, and is particularly damaging to innovative companies in the category of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"I therefore support the creation of a simple inexpensive single patent for the entire EU."
"I am concerned that it has not been possible to reach agreement on a common solution because of insurmountable differences of opinion over arrangements for the translation of patents."
"In my opinion, the stubborn insistence on the need to translate patents into most of the official languages of the EU is a manifestation of national egotism, since the costs, administrative demands and time required for this would largely wipe out the advantages of the single patent."
"I very much welcome the fact that my own country, the Czech Republic, has decided to join the calls for enhanced cooperation which we have supported today, thereby adding to the large majority of Member States already backing this."
"Even though the single patent will not cover the entire EU, I do not doubt that it will be a beneficial instrument for development, and for boosting the competitiveness of SMEs."
"Patent protection is one of the basic instruments for competitiveness and economic growth."
"It supports scientific research activity, thereby boosting employment in a sector with high added value."
"I have supported Parliament's recommendations on the proposed Council decision permitting enhanced cooperation in the area of unitary patent protection because it is based on the conclusions of the Council from 4 December 2009, which define the future form of the unitary patent system."
"The European patent system should be based on two pillars, consisting of a unified system for resolving patent disputes (the Court for European Patents and EU Patents) and for creating EU patents (an instrument applying a patent across the entire EU)."
"The enhanced patent cooperation will make it simpler to approve European patents within the territory of the Member States participating in the enhanced cooperation, which will reduce costs and simplify the procedure for obtaining patents, and, at the same time, this mechanism will contribute to scientific and technological progress and enhance the functioning of the internal market."
"At the beginning of February of this year, the Czech Republic joined the calls for enhanced cooperation, and I therefore hope that accession of my country to the unitary patent protection system will help to support scientific resources and better scientific results, both in the Czech Republic and elsewhere."
"The creation of a European patent will stimulate innovation and scientific and technological development in the EU."
"I believe it is essential to resolve the matter of the European patent."
"However, I have reservations about the language arrangements to be established."
"In my opinion, the best solution would be the use of English only but, if the language arrangements are extended to other languages, Portuguese must be considered."
"Competition is global, and Portuguese is the third most widely spoken western language, after English and Spanish."
"A European patent system is a necessity."
"The existence of different interpretations and decisions in each Member State causes legal uncertainty."
"The obligatory translation of each patent file into the 23 official languages is expensive, lengthy and creates a loss of competitiveness."
"Therefore, in general, the overwhelming majority of interested parties, including professional associations, agrees with the 'English-only' option."
"The proposal under discussion picks out three languages (English, French and German), with all the other languages ranking behind."
"In terms of global prominence, however, Portuguese is a much more important language than French or German."
"I also have many reservations about the viability of using enhanced cooperation in this case."
"An instrument that is intended to allow a group of countries to start processes of greater integration which could progressively include all the others must not be converted into a private club and an exclusion mechanism, or one which establishes the predominance of some over others."
"Therefore, I am against the Lehne report."
"I voted in favour of this legislative resolution of the European Parliament because I agree with its content."
"However, I regret the absence of the Portuguese language in the European patent arrangements."
"The internal market and competition policy are two cornerstones of the process of European unification which aim not only at strengthening the European Union's economy and its businesses but, above all, at realising the fundamental freedoms of the Union."
"This objective must be pursued in the interests of all European citizens and enterprises, offering equal opportunities and substantial equality while avoiding problems, additional costs and superstructures that could differentiate, discriminate between or limit the opportunities to enjoy or protect one's own rights."
"Giving all European Union citizens the right to express themselves in their own language in dealings with the EU institutions is a fundamental right in terms of equality, equal opportunities and non-discrimination."
"The use of just some of the official languages can technically only be justified within the activities of the EU institutions and not in its relations with citizens, enterprises and institutions in the Member States."
"Enhanced cooperation procedures are useful when they increase the opportunities for those that participate in them, without compromising them for the others."
"I therefore voted against the recommendation since I think enhanced cooperation is unacceptable in such a delicate context as the political equality of languages, as it would create discrimination in terms of the right of equal opportunity to access the EU's fundamental freedoms."
"I am very satisfied with the point we have reached on this subject, which had been pending since the 1990s."
"In December 2009, the Council adopted the principle of creating an EU patent."
"One year later, however, the Council confirmed that there were insurmountable difficulties regarding translation arrangements which required unanimity."
"The matter was then taken up by the Belgian Presidency of the EU, but since the obstacles remained, 12 Member States requested a proposal for a regulation authorising enhanced cooperation in the creation of a unitary patent."
"The Competitiveness Council thus provided for the authorisation of enhanced cooperation in March 2011."
"I would remind you that the creation of a unitary patent will bring advantages for users of the patent system in Europe and, in particular, it will allow small and medium-sized enterprises, which are often neglected, to improve their competitiveness through improved access to protection via the patent as well as a reduction in costs."
"I voted for this report as I think that enhanced cooperation in the area of creating a unitary patent is the best solution at the moment, and I hope that, in the meantime, all Member States will participate in it for the benefit of Europe's citizens."
"Having a single patent will significantly reduce administrative costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, stimulate innovation and help create new jobs at a time when the EU has an ever-growing need for them."
"It is vital to have EU-wide legislation that protects patents in order to defend intellectual property rights."
"We will be able to have uniform protection in the territories of the participating Member States as well as reduced costs and simplified administrative procedures."
"I wish to point out that, at the moment, the cost of registering a patent in Europe is about 10 times higher than for a Japanese or North American patent."
"Therefore, innovation and scientific investigation will benefit and the internal market will be improved at the same time."
"According to Commissioner Barnier, only Spain and Italy have shown no interest in this enhanced cooperation."
"However, he does have some legal reservations about the applicability of the enhanced cooperation procedure in this specific case."
"In effect, according to Article 328(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 'When enhanced cooperation is being established, it shall be open to all Member States, subject to compliance with any conditions of participation laid down by the authorising decision."
"It shall also be open to them at any other time, subject to compliance with the acts already adopted within that framework, in addition to those conditions'."
"I would point out that the language arrangements of this enhanced cooperation will consist of just three languages: English, French and German."
"I am against Parliament's green light on the use of the enhanced cooperation procedure to create a unitary patent system since I think the issue of the language regime is of fundamental importance for Italian interests, given that Italy is fourth in Europe for the number of patents filed."
"I think the enhanced cooperation procedure has been used cynically."
"It was created to give greater impetus to the process of integration of the European Union by providing the possibility of proceeding on an issue with a smaller number of Member States where it is impossible to reach a unanimous agreement."
"Forcing this through could set a dangerous precedent since it harms a Member State and circumvents the unanimity that the Treaty of Lisbon requires for issues concerning the internal market, as well as the principle of not distorting competition within it."
"Furthermore, we would have preferred to wait for the decision of the Court of Justice, which we are expecting on 8 March."
"We voted against this report for three fundamental reasons."
"It is inadmissible for Parliament to endorse a proposal for enhanced cooperation in this area of so-called unitary patents because it only seeks to put in jeopardy the rights that the Member States have to defend their interests, merely to benefit the more powerful countries."
"This is the second time that this principle of enhanced cooperation, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, has been used."
"The purpose behind its inclusion is starting to become clear."
"It is unacceptable for them to pressurise states which belong to the EU, but which do not accept the conditions that the majority wishes to impose on them, particularly in such sensitive areas as language, since the proposed agreement threatens the languages of the majority of the countries."
"Lastly, I must just make a final comment to reaffirm the positions that the Portuguese Communist Party delegates in the European Parliament have always held in their unwavering defence of the Portuguese language."
"It is not every day that we have the opportunity to discuss a subject as important as the EU patent, which is the subject of Mr Lehne's recommendation."
"I am therefore very pleased to be given the chance to contribute to this debate."
"Firstly, it should be noted that we are currently at a very early stage of the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"All that the European Parliament's recommendation will do is to enable the Council to agree officially to measures being taken."
"Everything is therefore still possible, or, to be more specific, amendments can be made to the European Commission's proposals for regulations."
"Without going into details as regards the proposals for regulations on the patent itself or the language regime, I would like to say that while implementing this great European project, we must bear in mind the interests of all European entrepreneurs, or, in other words, both those who patent inventions and those who are interested in easy access to technical information regarding such inventions."
"I am thinking here of the manufacturers of generic medicines, for example."
"Since I am a staunch supporter of the European patent and, at the same time, a representative of Poland, a country which today is unfortunately more a patent 'recipient' than a patent 'donor', I will endeavour to ensure that the scope of the debate on the patent is as broad as possible, and that it pays heed to everyone's opinions, in particular, those of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are essential for an innovative European economy."
"The European patent is supposed to help us boost innovation, yet why can we not manage to be innovative ourselves when debating it?"
"We should be ashamed of ourselves."
"We talk of nothing but patent law; let us also talk about establishing an optimum form for patents."
"We currently have short and long patents, yet it is not necessarily the case at all that the latter are better written."
"The description is frequently made more complex on purpose in order to obscure and complicate the form of the patent."
"I think that we need to create a transparent form for patents and a procedure for describing them, so that the Internet and electronic recording methods can be put to good use."
"Language is a related issue, and a set algorithm could be used to solve this problem."
"I think that the cheapest method, which would not require translations into different languages, would be a European e-patent."
"Maybe the Commission will start to think innovatively."
"I voted in favour, although I believe that the Commission is showing too little initiative on this matter."
"in writing. - In light of the impetus given by the Commission and Parliament to relaunch the single market, the need for a harmonised system for the issuance and regulation of patents has never been greater."
"It is for this reason that I voted in favour of this legislative resolution."
"Under the current fragmented patent system, patents have to be translated into the language of each of the States for which they have been granted, imposing exorbitant costs on entrepreneurs, start-ups and other innovation-based SMEs for translations: obtaining a patent is thirteen times more expensive in the EU than in the US and eleven times more expensive than in Japan."
"Under the new system to be adopted by Member States participating in enhanced cooperation in this area, the unitary patent will fall under a much more affordable translation regime consisting of solely the French, English and German languages; resulting in the cutting of costs."
"The introduction of a unitary and affordable patent system, albeit only in some EU Member States, will play an important role in the furtherance of the single market, particularly by giving the Union the boost in innovation and creativity with regard to the creation of goods and services which it so desperately needs."
"For several years, we have seen the European economy being held back by the absence of a competitive EU patent, in comparison with other large world powers."
"For around 15 years, the European Commission has been proposing the creation of a single European patent."
"Finally, thanks to the 'enhanced cooperation' procedure, which allows several Member States to cooperate in a particular area when a legislative initiative is being blocked, we have been able to take a step in this direction."
"I therefore voted enthusiastically in favour of this report, which allows us to launch this enhanced cooperation procedure in order to create an EU patent system."
"This is an important step forward for all European businesses and for all small and medium-sized enterprises, which have been waiting a long time for this instrument, an instrument which is indispensable for innovation, research and development and competitiveness in Europe."
"I voted in favour of this recommendation concerning the authorisation of enhanced cooperation for creating a European patent."
"In December 2010, 12 Member States, including France, wanted to use an enhanced cooperation procedure following disagreement among the 27, due to linguistic differences, on the introduction of an EU patent system."
"In the end, all the Member States except Italy and Spain decided to participate."
"I would like it to be possible for these two countries to be able to get involved in the initiative at any point."
"It is currently 11 times more expensive to file a patent in the European Union than in the United States."
"In the future, our researchers and businesses will finally be able to start competing effectively on innovation with the United States and Asia."
"After more than 10 years, work on a unitary European patent is finally coming to an end."
"In spite of the fact that we have only achieved a partial success, since the unitary patent protection system does not cover the entire territory of the European Union, it should undoubtedly be regarded as a significant step forward."
"The simplification of registration procedures and a significant reduction in their cost will promote the development of the internal market and stimulate scientific and technical progress throughout the EU as a whole, even if they only cover 12 Member States."
"Although legislation will only be harmonised to a limited extent, this harmonisation will, in reality, affect all EU entrepreneurs, since investors based in Member States which are not participating will also be able to take advantage of unitary patent protection."
"It will be up to them to decide on an individual basis whether to choose protection under the legal system of one or several Member States, or whether to use the unitary European patent."
"I believe that we should continue measures aimed at extending the scope of unitary patent protection, so that it ultimately covers the entire territory of the European Union."
"It is not only individual entrepreneurs that will benefit, since the European market will also become more competitive compared to other large economies such as the United States, China or Japan."
"I supported this draft resolution on a proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, as I believe that a unitary patent registration system will reduce administrative barriers for European businesses."
"The European Union cannot afford a fragmented patent registration system."
"Today, it has taken a giant stride forward towards a unitary registration system."
"The status quo, under which a business must register its patent in every Member State separately, is a significant hindrance to business development."
"The slow and complicated process for registering a patent in the European Union hitherto has restricted opportunities for our businesses to develop dynamically."
"A clear and efficient procedure whereby anyone may register a patent valid throughout the European Union will ensure that new products can reach the market more quickly, thereby boosting the rate at which businesses develop."
"Those countries who take part in this patent registration system and entrepreneurs in those countries, who will be able to supply new products quickly to all European consumers, will be the winners."
"At the moment, the internal market is particularly fragmented due to the high costs of patent protection in the European Union, and European inventors are unable to enjoy all the benefits of the single market."
"The difficulty arises when the latter try to obtain the best level of protection across the whole of the Union."
"This situation has an adverse impact on the EU's competitiveness as activities involving innovation produce human capital which tends to be more mobile than in other areas."
"The current less favourable conditions for innovation make the European Union a less attractive place for creativity and innovation, for European and non-European inventors alike."
"I voted for this recommendation as enhancing cooperation within a group of Member States in the area of unitary patent protection will safeguard the interests of the Union, based on the fact that it will boost the EU's competitiveness and make it more attractive to the rest of the world."
"Furthermore, creating unitary patent protection for a group of Member States would improve the level of patent protection and remove the costs and complexity associated with the relevant territories, which would facilitate scientific and technological progress and the operation of the internal market."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"I believe the permitted level of radiation in foodstuffs must be raised and, in addition, monitoring and compliance must be improved."
"Depending on the outcome of the final reading, this regulation has the potential to contribute to that process."
"I welcome the fact that this regulation will also apply to foodstuffs or feedingstuffs imported from third countries in customs transit or intended for export."
"It is beyond doubt that the sphere of intellectual property rights, and particularly industrial property rights, deserves special care and attention."
"However, EU bodies and institutions do not always succeed in this."
"A comprehensive, systemic solution is often defeated by details or even by lobbying interests."
"The issue of the EU patent - formerly the Community patent - is an example of this."
"The possibility of at least a partial solution is now arising in the form of enhanced cooperation between some Member States in establishing unitary patent protection."
"The Czech Republic wishes to participate in this enhanced cooperation and also wishes to take part in further negotiations over concrete proposals for a regulation on the unitary patent and its language regime."
"Failure to participate in the enhanced cooperation would mean not being able to influence the future form of the EU patent system."
"One significant aspect is the economic benefit, or the advantages for businesses deriving from the new technical solutions, in view of the size of the common market of those participating in the enhanced cooperation."
"I would also like to mention that the Czech Republic retains the option of withdrawing from the enhanced cooperation, should this cooperation take a direction contrary to the positions of the Czech Republic, particularly regarding the language regime and the area of patent jurisprudence."
"I am abstaining on this report."
"It is not that I am against the sovereign right of the Member States to come to enhanced cooperation agreements among themselves, including in relation to patents."
"However, no guarantee has been given to us concerning the ecological and hygienic standards that will be applied during the approval process for these patents, in particular, concerning genetically modified organisms."
"Until the necessary requirements for preserving public health are included, I will not support this type of agreement."
"With the approval of this report, which seeks to establish enhanced cooperation in connection with the registration and protection of patents, there is a risk of imposing language arrangements that are limited to three languages only - English, German and French - with translation of the patent into the respective national language in each Member State no longer being required."
"Although the purpose of creating an EU patent is positive in the sense that it would help to revitalise and promote innovation in Europe, nevertheless, I would argue that this cannot be pursued with the violation of the fundamental principles of European citizenship itself, with the breaking of Community cohesion and fragmentation of the internal market or with the introduction of new factors of discrimination, inequality and imbalance."
"The Portuguese language - the third most important European language of universal communication - will suffer inexplicable discrimination with the introduction of this 'enhanced cooperation'."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The dispute over the languages used in EU patents has been going on for more than 30 years."
"Over the course of these 30 years, European companies have had to cope with high translation costs and, in some cases, have been put at a competitive disadvantage on the global market."
"It is hard to place a value on intangible assets, such as trademarks and patents."
"However, they are used as the security for loans and are also taken into account in credit ratings."
"Against this background, the new patent law, which has been drawn up by means of the enhanced cooperation process, and which is valid at least in parts of the EU, only requires patents to be translated into German, English and French."
"This will certainly reduce the amount of bureaucracy involved."
"The new regulation also strengthens the position of the German language, which is still the most widely spoken native language within the EU, according to a survey carried out in 2006."
"In principle, the idea is a good one, but the rules on languages are not entirely clear, which is why I have abstained."
"The creation of unitary patent protection in the Community (now European Union) and ensuring effective patent protection throughout the EU represent a step towards greater EU competitiveness."
"Currently, inventors working in the European Union are at a disadvantage compared to their colleagues in other countries around the world: protecting inventions across the whole of the EU is a lengthy and expensive process."
"Unfortunately, due to procedural challenges, we have been unable to establish a uniform system across the EU."
"Nevertheless, I congratulate those Member States that have decided to initiate the cooperation procedure in the area of patent protection (I am particularly pleased that the Member States include Lithuania), and I am voting in favour of approving this cooperation."
"I voted against the introduction of a trilingual system in patent regulations."
"Translating patents exclusively into English, French and German would cause serious harm to Italian enterprises, which would have to bear extremely high costs for the technical translation of patents they file."
"My parliamentary group urged us to vote in favour, but I do not feel that I can approve legislation that I believe to be harmful to the interests of my country and its citizens, particularly all Italian small and medium-sized enterprises and our consumers."
"It is obvious that increased costs for enterprises would then cause higher product costs, to the detriment of consumers."
"Enhanced cooperation should remain a mechanism to be used in exceptional circumstances and should not be used to exclude Members States that are prepared to negotiate, such as Italy and Spain."
"I support the Italian proposal to write patents in the language of the country of the inventor and to provide an English translation as well."
"This way, we can preserve our linguistic independence and the interests of our country."
"Indeed, enhanced cooperation between 10 or 12 countries on this issue runs the risk of distorting the conditions of fair competition, to the advantage of those countries participating."
"I agreed with this resolution on the proposal for a Council decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection."
"Given the current situation where it is very difficult and expensive to obtain a European patent, I agree with the proposal to apply the cooperation procedure and to allow all interested EU Member States to create a unitary patent system."
"We must make every effort to resolve the issue of the language regime, which would reduce the cost of obtaining a European patent for companies operating within the EU."
"Furthermore, patent protection that functions effectively would simplify dispute settlement procedures and would reduce the administrative burden."
"I am pleased that many European Union Member States are contributing to the initiative to create a unitary patent, and hope that the remaining countries will also soon help achieve the objective of creating a unitary patent for improved economic liberalisation conditions within the European Union."
"Only enhanced cooperation will facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market by eliminating obstacles to the free movement of goods."
"I voted in favour of the recommendation for a decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection."
"The future of Europe depends, and Member States such as Greece, which have been hard hit by the crisis, are pinning their hopes for the recovery of their national economies and productive fabric on innovation."
"It is therefore economically vital and socially fair to provide legal protection for patents which cover the invention and implementation of innovative ideas and products."
"I am in favour of a European patent system, but, on reflection, and for reasons of language, I abstained from voting on the present report."
"I would actually have voted in favour if only English were to be used, since today it functions as a lingua franca."
"I abstained for three fundamental reasons: firstly, because to create a patent system with the obligatory translation of each file into the 23 official languages would be expensive, slow and would create a serious competitive disadvantage; secondly, because in practice, the English language is commonly used today as a lingua franca; and, thirdly, because 90% of patent applications are made in English anyway."
"I cannot agree to the inclusion in this process of the French and German languages to the detriment of more widely spoken languages such as Portuguese or Spanish (as if languages with different statuses existed in the EU, an idea that I reject)."
"Therefore, I abstained, in the belief that progress on a European patent system is needed, but that the best solution would be one language only: English."
"I abstained from the vote because, although I believe it is essential to improve the patent system in Europe, in particular, with the creation of a unitary patent and a European and EU Patents Court, which would make it possible to overcome the problems for small and medium-sized enterprises caused by the current fragmentation in the existing system, characterised by high costs and excessive complexity, I also understand the reservations that some countries have expressed with regard to the translation arrangements for the EU patent."
"Therefore, I do not oppose the start of enhanced cooperation in this field, though I believe that it is not the most desirable and most definitive solution to the problem."
"The absence of unitary patent protection throughout the European Union puts European companies in a clear position of competitive disadvantage compared to their US and Japanese peers."
"The costs of patenting in Europe are almost 10 times higher than the costs of patenting in the US and Japan, which is essentially because of outlay on translating patents into the languages of the EU's various countries."
"In order to make Portuguese and European industry more competitive in this context, I consider it crucial to make rapid progress towards the creation of a unitary patent protection system that is less burdensome and complex, and that can operate as a stimulus for innovation, and for scientific and technological development in Portugal and the EU."
"That is why I voted for this resolution."
"Nevertheless, I cannot fail to express my regret at the choices regarding the language regime."
"In truth, I believe that there are weighty arguments against the current three-language solution, using English, German and French;"
"I therefore believe that it would have been preferable in every way to have opted for the English-only regime."
"Today, I have voted in favour of the introduction of enhanced cooperation with regard to unitary patent protection because I believe that the deadlock in the Council as a result of the language arrangements is unjustified."
"In my opinion, there is, of course, an important need for discussion."
"For me, voting in favour does not mean that I agree in full with the contents of the Commission's initial proposals."
"We will give priority to this issue in the Committee on Legal Affairs and will definitely table amendments with a large number of improvements."
"I would like to explain that those who believe that today's vote will result in Parliament losing its rights are mistaken."
"The legislative procedure is only just beginning."
"By voting today, Parliament was simply giving permission for a group of Member States to start the enhanced cooperation procedure, which was only made possible by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The remainder of the procedure will involve a) Parliament being consulted about the language arrangements (the decision in this case must be made by the Council), b) Parliament taking part in deciding on the content of the patent regulation as part of the ordinary legislative procedure, c) Parliament's consent being obtained for the patent jurisdiction."
"There will be no change in any of these opportunities for Parliament to participate in the process."
"Even those Members of the European Parliament from Member States which are not involved in the enhanced cooperation will not lose their right to vote during the remainder of the procedure, because they are European and not national representatives."
"The Belgian Presidency of the European Union has been a complete success."
"Among the many things it has achieved is the agreement on the European patent, a regulation which is imperative for boosting innovation and competitiveness in Europe."
"Liberal Europeans had wished for this kind of harmonisation of legal protection for almost 15 years."
"It will put an end to the wastage of funds, estimated at almost EUR 400 000 per year, which results from the coexistence of national patents and European patents."
"Furthermore, the fact that 12 Member States (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom) are using the enhanced cooperation procedure is all the better if it was the only way to put an end to the deadlock on this matter."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has been applied fairly to authorise a 'European vanguard' of a minimum of nine Member States to cooperate when a legislative initiative is being blocked."
"For all these reasons, today's European Parliament vote on the Lehne report at midday is essential."
"It sends a positive signal, both for European businesses, which need to evolve within a stable legal framework, putting them on an equal footing with international competition, and for inventors, whose creative activity needs to be better protected by the European Union."
"in writing. - Our group cannot agree to give its consent and to initiate a procedure because, in the words of the Advocates General of the Court of Justice: 'As it stands at present, the envisaged agreement creating a unified patent litigation system is incompatible with the treaties'."
"Our group has asked for the postponement of the vote as the Court decision on the above opinion of the Advocates General is due already on 8 March and Parliament should be fully aware of the legal consequences of the 'enhanced cooperation' before embarking on such an exceptional project."
"The other political groups have not supported our request for postponement."
"The consent does not concern specific measures implementing enhanced cooperation."
"Such proposals will be submitted at a later stage, if enhanced cooperation is authorised (i.e. Council regulations creating unitary patent protection and translation arrangements for the unitary patent)."
"I voted against this resolution because I think that after a long legislative process that began in 2000, it is now unacceptable that a shared solution has not been proposed on the linguistic aspect of European patents."
"For many years, Italy and Spain have been pressing hard for English to be recognised as the only official language in the area of technology and science."
"This one-language solution would cut costs, providing encouragement, above all, to small and medium-sized enterprises to use the European patent since their economic dimensions means they often cannot bear high translation costs."
"In order to bypass the unanimity that such a delicate subject requires, the use of enhanced cooperation has been invoked (as provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon) which would allow decisions to be taken by just one third of the Member States."
"For some months, the Italian and Spanish governments have been pointing out the unusual characteristics of this procedure which, if approved by the European Parliament and the Council with a qualified majority, would make the European patent applicable not only in States participating in the enhanced cooperation, but also to businesses belonging to other Member States."
"Italy and Europe would suffer as a result of the decision to use enhanced cooperation in the creation of unitary patent protection."
"Implementing an enhanced cooperation procedure on this issue is profoundly mistaken because it nullifies the efforts made to create a European patent that would be valid in all Member States."
"We also contest the decision to try and force this vote through Parliament without bearing in mind the consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice on the compatibility of the single Patents Court with the Treaty."
"Italy, together with Spain, has rightly opposed the recognition of just three languages (English, French and German) for filing European patents instead of respecting the principle of equal status of languages, as enshrined by the Treaty."
"It is obvious that this is not only a matter of discrimination but is also really economically damaging for enterprises in countries using languages other than these."
"I firmly believe that the enhanced cooperation in the area of patent protection will help to eliminate the fragmentation in this area, secure better framework conditions for innovative businesses throughout the Union, lead to greater EU competitiveness on a global scale and the better functioning of the EU internal market."
"The anticipated reduction in costs associated with the patent protection process is also not inconsiderable."
"I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (HU) I voted for the recommendation because I find it outrageous that we still have not been able to form a common position on the issue."
"We must realise that Europe has fallen behind in the global innovation competition."
"There can be no innovation without comprehensive patent protection, but universities, smaller research institutes and inventors are unable to bear the costs of such patenting."
"By only obtaining a patent in their own country, they are essentially giving their inventions to the global market for free."
"EU patenting is of vital importance."
"It is extremely important to be able to obtain a European patent with a single application."
"It is of vital interest that this is realised in all European countries, including my home country, Hungary."
"More than 20 years ago now, the European Commission proposed creating a single European patent as soon as possible, and emphasised the pressing need for such a patent."
"At the moment, patents in Europe have to be approved country by country, and they have to be translated each time into the relevant national language."
"In order to get a patent approved in just half of the EU Member States, it is necessary to pay up to EUR 20 000, of which EUR 14 000 is for translation."
"In the United States, around EUR 1 850 suffices."
"The lack of a European patent hinders our competitiveness, as well as European innovation, research and development."
"This is why enhanced cooperation is fully justified on this subject, which is fundamental for the future of the EU."
"The creation of a European unitary patent within the European Union will bring with it advantages for all the users involved and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, insofar as it will contribute to their competitiveness through a reduction in costs."
"This issue, which already goes back two decades, requires unanimous agreement within the Council to determine the language arrangements applicable to intellectual property rights in the European Union."
"In this respect, and bearing in mind that the creation of unitary patent protection is not included on the list of areas of exclusive competence of the European Union, the present recommendation relates to the possibility of enhanced cooperation in this field."
"Although, at this stage in the process, we are only dealing with Parliament's consent to the decision-making method in this area, which receives my vote, this House will shortly also be called on to give a verdict on the controversial language arrangements and on the two regulations to be drafted with regard to the rules of the European patent system."
"I voted for the decision authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection as I feel it is necessary to adopt measures to create a unitary EU patent."
"According to a report produced in 2011 by Thomson Reuters entitled 'Patented in China', China is going to overtake Japan and the US in terms of numbers of patents."
"Indeed, China's intention with the programme launched in 2006 was to become a country focused on innovation, and it managed to increase the number of patents by 14.1%, 33.55% and 15.9% compared to the US, EU and Japan respectively."
"In the EU, the current patent system is fragmented and exorbitant with regard to translation requirements."
"The cost of an EU patent validated in 13 countries is as high as EUR 20 000, of which roughly EUR 14 000 are for translation costs alone."
"This makes a European patent 10 times more expensive than a US one."
"I think that authorising enhanced cooperation in the area of creating unitary patents can help develop a unitary patent which is attractive to users of the European patent system, offer intellectual property protection across the whole of the EU and remove the costs and complications with the aim of encouraging research, development and innovative SMEs."
"Bearing in mind that the Consultative Working Party of the Legal Services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission concluded, in its opinion, that the proposal concerned does not contain substantive amendments, other than those identified as such, and that, with regard to the codification of the unchanged provisions of the earlier acts together with the included amendments, the proposal contains a straightforward codification of the existing acts without substantive alterations, I approve the present report."
"I agree with the guarantee of a high level of protection of the health of European citizens in the event of radioactive contamination and with the democratic legitimacy in the adoption of the present directive, since the legal basis has to be adapted to the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"I voted in favour of this important resolution on the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency."
"We all remember the Chernobyl tragedy of 26 April 1986 when considerable quantities of radioactive materials were released into the atmosphere, thereby contaminating foodstuffs (grain, vegetables, berries and mushrooms) and feedingstuffs in several European countries, and there was a major risk to human health."
"Fields were also contaminated with radioactive fallout, which increased the radioactivity of forest and agricultural foodstuffs from the affected areas."
"A high level of protection of human health is one of the European Union's objectives."
"We therefore urgently need to set up a system allowing the European Union, following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which has or is likely to lead to a significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, to fix maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in order to ensure a high level of protection of public health."
"All EU citizens must have the greatest possible protection in the event of a nuclear or radiological accident, and the European Commission must be ready to react quickly."
"Pre-established maximum permitted levels of contamination must be applied to foodstuffs and feedingstuffs."
"This report sets the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination for foodstuffs and animal feed following a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency."
"I agree that the European Parliament must play a crucial role in situations having a direct impact on the general public's health."
"I also believe that, in the wake of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency, the European Commission must play a supervisory role, declaring a state of emergency and adopting lists of basic foodstuffs and feedingstuffs."
"Member States must maintain an official control system for these products and inform the general public about any risks."
"I voted for this report, which guarantees the safety of European citizens' food in the event of nuclear accidents or radiological emergencies."
"A high level of protection of human health is one of the objectives that the European Union must achieve as it defines its policy."
"EU regulations laying down levels of radioactive contamination in case of radiological emergency remain unchanged since 1990, and therefore it is necessary to review and update these provisions."
"We must set up a comprehensive system allowing the Union, following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to a significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, to fix maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination in order to ensure a high level of protection of public health."
"I agree that the permitted levels of radioactive contamination must be reviewed at regular intervals in order to take into account the latest international scientific progress and scientific recommendations and to avoid existing divergences in regulatory practice."
"I voted in favour of this report which proposes to stipulate the procedure for determining the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs which may be placed on the market following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency which is likely to lead to, or has led to, significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs."
"At the same time, Annexes I and III set out the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs."
"Although this proposal is dealt with through the recasting technique, I believe that we must substantially amend the proposal beyond the sole grey part identified, so as to ensure the legal certainty and coherence of the text."
"It is necessary to streamline the procedure in cases of nuclear emergency by clearly giving a supervisory role to the Commission and clarifying the regime of its acts (adoption, revision)."
"Furthermore, we must attempt to serve the interests of the citizens through better management of the post-accident situation."
"We must ensure legal certainty of the whole proposal through the alignment of obsolete procedures - 'comitology' procedures in the field of Euratom adopted by analogy - which this proposal intends to codify, with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Bearing in mind that the three regulations on radiation amended by the report in question were adopted in the wake of Chernobyl about 20 years ago, I consider that the Belet report, as it now stands after the vote, is a first attempt to improve the approach to and update the problem of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and the soil."
"Although I am in favour of the change to the legal basis and of strengthening the role of the European Parliament, in order to achieve greater transparency in legislation and broader protection for citizens, I consider the report to be inadequate and several steps behind what would be a substantive approach to the problem."
"It amends what has already been agreed and simply regulates the consequences, rather than the source, of the problem."
"Furthermore, it has left the maximum limits for radioactive contamination extremely high and, as a result, it is far removed from the objective of protecting public health."
"It is for the above reasons that I abstained in the final vote."
"I believe that EU Member States are responsible for monitoring compliance with the levels laid down for protection against radioactive contamination in this regulation, in particular, through the surveillance of the safety standards of both foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, as well as through monitoring environmental parameters."
"I support the idea of creating a system which will allow the EU to set the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination to ensure a high level of protection for the general public's health, following a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency."
"I voted in favour of the report relating to the radioactive contamination of foodstuffs, the aim of which is to set the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other radiological emergency."
"Therefore, the main objective of the regulation is the protection of public health and accordingly, the legal basis must be Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The present proposal aims to guarantee a high level of protection of the health of European citizens in the event of radioactive contamination and also to confer democratic legitimacy on the adoption of the present regulation."
"There is no doubt that its legal basis must be adapted to the new Treaty of Lisbon in order to grant Parliament a role in the decision-making process concerning a regulation that potentially affects public health."
"Essentially, this proposal consists of the codification of the unchanged provisions of three regulations adopted between 1987 and 1990, which establish the permitted levels of radioactive contamination in the event of a radiological emergency."
"All people have the right to a healthy diet."
"This is an unquestionable right and a sine qua non for attaining the quality of life that we all aspire to, and which the Treaty of Lisbon reflects."
"After the Chernobyl disaster (1986), the question of radioactive contamination of the environment gained in importance and justified the adoption of three regulations, between 1987 and 1990, which set the maximum permitted levels of contamination in the event of a radiological emergency or nuclear accident, seeing that these effects are long lasting and, very often, can be indirect (contamination of woodlands)."
"Although the proposal basically entails a codification of the unchanged provisions of the regulations mentioned above, I am voting in favour of this report on the proposal for a Council regulation (Euratom) because the guaranteed maintenance of high levels of protection for European citizens' health is in danger."
"This proposal essentially consists of a codification of the unchanged provisions of three regulations adopted between 1987 and 1990, which establish the permitted levels of radioactive contamination in the event of a radiological emergency."
"However, the insertion of a new recital which explains the need for an existing article, reserving for the Council the use of implementing powers, implies a substantive change which justifies the use of the recasting technique."
"The content of the regulation consists of a mechanism of two levels of intervention in the event of a radiological emergency or nuclear accident, as proposed by the Commission:"
"the immediate adoption by the Commission of an ad hoc regulation to apply the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination specified in Annexes I and III of the proposal to a specific case, in a definite area and for a limited period;"
"establishment of a period of one month following its adoption for the Commission to forward a proposal to the Council to adapt or confirm this ad hoc regulation."
"As shown in the debate in the specialist committee itself and in the alternative proposals which it presents, there is a power struggle going on here between the Commission and the Council."
"However, the primary aim should be to serve the citizens' interests by means of better management of post-accident situations, with respect for the competences of the Member States affected."
"Therefore, our final vote was one of abstention."
"in writing. - ECR Group MEPs supported this report as we believed that the legal basis of this legislation should be changed from 'Article 31 EAEC' to 'Article 168 TFEU'."
"Under the original regulation, Article 31 EAEC (which focuses on the group of persons who might be subject to radioactive contamination) was considered the most appropriate legal basis as Article 168 TFEU (which regulates public health) did not exist."
"If Article 168 TFEU was the legal base of this regulation, then this would imply a change from consultation to the ordinary legislative procedure and the proposal would then be subject to full European Parliament scrutiny and, most importantly, a full impact assessment, including consultation with food producers and consumers."
"While there could be certain aspects of Parliament's adopted report that ECR MEPs do not support, we strongly believe that the legal basis of this regulation should be changed to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process and additionally, that it should be accompanied by a thorough impact assessment."
"The ECR Group therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The regulations we have prepared today are of enormous economic significance for the European Union and its single market."
"The Chernobyl disaster showed us that the linear extrapolation of radiation-related risk results in unnecessary economic losses."
"Areas equal in size to many a country were evacuated in Belarus and Ukraine."
"Belarusians are now returning to these areas, where radioactivity is the same as that in the centre of Warsaw, unbelievable as it may seem."
"Meanwhile, some of the 'Chernobyl victims', the around 8 million Ukrainians who receive allowances which are, in any case, too low to live on, will not consider returning for fear of losing this meagre compensation."
"The European Union should draw conclusions from this experience, which is of vital importance."
"It was easy to resettle people within the former USSR, and it was accomplished efficiently after the disaster."
"It is hard to imagine how this would be done in Europe's densely-populated areas."
"Who would be given the responsibility for such a task?"
"Financial compensation should be awarded in particular to farmers, who may lose not only their crops, but also the opportunity to cultivate any crops for many years."
"The same applies to forests, although to a lesser degree."
"It is well known that the polluter should pay, but how will we decide who is responsible and who should pay if we are hit by nuclear fallout from third countries?"
"Who will deal with this?"
"The EU, of course."
"I therefore voted in favour of adopting the report."
"Regarding the Belet report, which asks, in particular, for Parliament to become a colegislator for health protection in case of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs, I could not vote in favour of a report which does not firmly reject the current doses proposed by the Commission."
"The maximum contamination levels proposed by the Commission, which have been in force since 1987, are far too high."
"Studies show that even with low doses, children suffer serious cardiovascular and endocrine problems."
"The proposed maximum doses would cause an unacceptable increase in the number of cancer cases."
"Furthermore, given that there is no mechanism in place to compensate farmers in case of contamination which exceeds the authorised levels, the Commission absolutely must propose a compensation mechanism in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"in writing. - Parliament today voted for a change in the legal basis for legislation on radioactive contamination in foodstuffs."
"This is an extremely important issue and it is only right that this House has codecision powers."
"I voted in favour of this important document on the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency."
"It is crucially important to determine the maximum permitted levels applied to foodstuffs and feedingstuffs in order to ensure a high level of public health protection and avoid a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster when foodstuffs (grain, vegetables, berries, mushrooms, etc.) and feedingstuffs, as well as fields, were contaminated with radioactive fallout, which increased the radioactivity of forest and agricultural foodstuffs from the areas affected."
"We must create a mechanism to adequately and effectively ensure safety in the event of a nuclear or radiological accident."
"A high level of protection of human health is one of the European Union's main objectives."
"Radioactive contamination is hazardous to human health, and our role as Members of the European Parliament is to do everything in our power to ensure that the food supplied to consumers is safe and healthy."
"We should therefore make the necessary preparations to enable us to respond rapidly and effectively enough in the event of a hazard, while, at the same time, constantly updating regulations and adapting them to the current state and progress of technology."
"Procedures need to be simplified and competences transferred to the Member States, which will be able to deal with such situations effectively."
"In this case, it would appear to be of key importance to set limits for concentrations of radioactive substances, for the safety of society and of the natural environment."
"In the case of a nuclear accident or any other kind of radiological emergency, it is essential that the proper action is taken."
"Preventive measures and aid for those affected are important."
"Compensation payments for farmers are vital in order to help producers of agricultural products who have suffered damages through no fault of their own."
"Farmers in one Member State who are affected by contamination from an accident of this kind in another Member State must also be compensated."
"The effects of nuclear accidents must not be allowed to put the livelihoods of farmers at risk."
"I support Mr Belet's report, because we must guarantee protection for farmers from damages caused by external third parties."
"This report and the ecological disasters that it claims to manage are a reminder to us of how urgent it is to abandon nuclear energy."
"Yet there is no question of abandoning nuclear energy in this report."
"That is one of the ways in which this report is lacking."
"It would have been worthwhile adopting the amendment."
"In addition, this report aims to grant the Commission every power necessary to introduce the security measures needed for a nuclear disaster."
"It makes the capacity of the leaders of the Member States to act in this matter merely optional, even though they are the ones elected by the people."
"It is inconceivable that power should be delegated in this way to the irresponsible Commission, especially when it comes to public health."
"I am voting against the report."
"The proposed regulation establishes the procedure for setting the maximum permitted limits of radioactive contamination for foodstuffs and animal feed which may be put on the market following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency, which may cause or has caused significant radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feed."
"I am of the opinion that we must remain alert and prepared for any emergency situation that may occur in Europe."
"Any attempt to enable the regulations in force to be employed with greater speed and agility will create added value for the whole territory of the European Union."
"Radioactive contamination can represent a problem over a number of years in some foods."
"The difficulty arises when contaminated foodstuffs, such as wild produce from the forests in areas that have been exposed to radioactivity for centuries, are not only consumed locally, but are also sold in otherwise uncontaminated areas, where they are believed to be harmless."
"Our current level of knowledge indicates that there are no levels of radiation that can be classified as harmless with any absolute degree of certainty."
"Research into the cause of a wide range of new forms of illness, such as allergies, is still in its infancy."
"Despite this fact, foodstuffs are still being irradiated and no one has considered the question of possible interaction with genetic engineering."
"All of the limits are ultimately useless if the checks on foodstuffs in and around contaminated regions are not functioning properly."
"I have taken these considerations into account when voting."
"I voted in favour of this resolution since it streamlines the procedure for intervening in the event of an emergency and strengthens the role of the Commission by stating that it - and not the Council - is directly responsible for decision making in the event of a nuclear accident, establishing measures that enter into force immediately."
"The Commission is to be assisted by a group of independent experts with competences in the health and food safety sectors."
"Furthermore, the available scientific data must be made accessible by the Commission so that its significance can be assessed."
"Member States must take actions to minimise the risks of contamination, including informing the public."
"In essence, this report protects citizens and gives the Commission and Parliament a leading role."
"Today, we voted on the regulation concerning 'the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency', which lays down guidelines for reacting to nuclear or radiological accidents."
"This document is purely technical in nature, essentially discussing limits to the competence of the Commission, the Council and Member States, and laying down levels of contamination."
"I would like to highlight one amendment proposed by Parliament, which proposes the inclusion of a provision on compensating farmers whose land is contaminated with poisonous substances during a nuclear or radiological accident."
"As we are living through rather unstable times, and we can see certain examples where man's negligent economic activities are often the cause of major accidents, we must pass legislation laying down clear provisions on how to react in critical situations."
"I agree with the proposal presented on the Council regulation laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency."
"The protection of human health is one of the European Union's priority objectives and we must therefore create a mechanism to adequately and effectively ensure safety in the event of a nuclear or radiological accident."
"The levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident must be regulated particularly strictly given the possible negative consequences for the public."
"We must take all possible measures to ensure that, in the event of an accident, radioactive particles released into the air contaminate foodstuffs as little as possible, and the radioactive impact is reduced to a minimum."
"I agree with the proposal that the fundamental EU environmental principle of 'the polluter pays' should be applied, thereby ensuring an effective compensation mechanism in the event of an accident, with a particular focus on farmers, who would suffer the most damage in this case."
"This report relates to a legislative proposal which essentially consists of a codification of the unchanged provisions of three regulations adopted between 1987 and 1990, following the Chernobyl disaster (1986), at which time the question of radioactive contamination of the environment became increasingly important."
"These regulations establish the permitted levels of radioactive contamination in the event of a radiological emergency."
"The content of the regulations consists of a mechanism of two levels of intervention in the event of a radiological emergency or nuclear accident, as proposed by the Commission: (a) immediate adoption by the Commission of an ad hoc regulation whereby the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination specified in Annexes I and III of the proposal can be applied to a specific case, in a definite area and for a limited period; and (b) establishment of a period of one month after its adoption for the Commission to forward a proposal to the Council to adapt or confirm this ad hoc regulation."
"I am voting in favour of this report as I think that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament are positive and confer a current logic to the text."
"As the main objective of the regulation is the protection of public health, I consider that the legal basis should be Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"in writing. - The radioactive contamination of food is clearly a concern for European public health and, as such, it is essential that this legislation is decided on that basis, with the European Parliament as a colegislator."
"As the proposal stands, however, it clearly falls short of what is required to protect the European public, particularly children, from radioactive contamination through foodstuffs."
"The maximum levels of radioactive contamination being proposed are far too high according to expert analysis - some of them are even higher than those in place when the Chernobyl disaster occurred."
"The proposed levels would imply that the public be exposed to radiation at levels higher than the maximum limits set out in existing EU legislation on safety standards for ionising radiation."
"This would expose the European public, notably vulnerable groups and children, to unnecessary risk from contamination and cancer."
"It is simply not acceptable that this legislative revision would fail to ensure Europe's citizens have total protection from radioactive contaminated food."
"I voted in favour of this resolution because it brings to light a fundamental problem that should never be underestimated."
"More and more countries are turning to nuclear power, both for civilian and, unfortunately, military purposes."
"This is now a reality of global significance which, unfortunately, also involves areas of extreme political instability."
"In the event of a crisis or accident, the European Union cannot allow itself to be unprepared to manage the emergency."
"Responses must be immediate, effective and perfectly coordinated between the various Member States."
"The radioactive fallout following such an event then leads to contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs that, if introduced to the food chain, can cause incalculable damage and contaminate entire areas for decades."
"European citizens must be able to sleep easily, safe in the knowledge that in the event of an emergency that all of us hope never to have to face, they will not be left at the mercy of events."
"Streamlined procedures with clear rules and responsibilities for all are essential to serve the true interests of citizens."
"We are in favour of the report laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs because it streamlines the procedures for intervention in the event of an emergency and strengthens the role of the Commission, granting it the authority to make decisions in the event of a nuclear accident."
"The maximum levels of radiation in both human and animal food are also indicated in the report."
"During the vote, an oral amendment that provides for the compensation of farmers adversely affected by the lost opportunity of selling any contaminated products was also adopted, again with our support."
"Nuclear accidents may occur wherever radioactive materials are used, stored or transported, so not only in nuclear power stations, but also in hospitals, universities, research laboratories and industrial plants, on roads and railway lines, in ports and in shipyards."
"The rapporteur rightly notes that radioactive substances may continue to have an impact for a great many years, and the overriding aim should always be to protect human life and health."
"At present, more and more food is irradiated in order to make it last longer."
"It is worth bearing in mind that irradiation destroys vitamins - up to 90% of vitamin A in chickens, 86% of vitamin B in oats and 70% of vitamin C in fruit juices."
"Foodstuffs are therefore made to last longer at the expense of their nutritional value."
"Research has proven that irradiation kills bacteria, but it does not destroy viruses or remove dirt or toxins which could get into meat in non-sterile and unhygienic slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants."
"Irradiation also contributes to the large-scale, expensive and wasteful transport of food, particularly by large corporations."
"Food which is produced and consumed locally does not need to be irradiated."
"It is my belief that the Member States should keep in place their food and feed control systems with regard to maximum permissible levels of radioactive contamination and constantly improve and review them, as suggested by the rapporteur."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Adoption of modifications to the Treaty (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the adoption of modifications to the Treaty."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that no provision has been made for questions from the floor during this debate."
"We are all very much aware that this is an extremely important debate, however, and so it is one to which we attach a great deal of importance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Commission has expressed a favourable opinion of the decision taken by the European Council in December to proceed to a limited modification of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"As you know, the aim is to allow the Member States in the euro area to create a permanent mechanism to ensure the financial stability of the euro area as a whole."
"In 2013, this European stability mechanism will replace the current temporary stability instruments - the European financial stability fund and the European financial stability mechanism - and we all know how useful they are."
"We are talking here about a decision which is essential for confirming our determination to defend our common currency and to guarantee financial stability when faced with economic imbalances in certain Member States, imbalances which we must correct."
"This is a mechanism which is necessary to complete the framework of the Treaty."
"This being so, and as I emphasised myself during the last European Council, every initiative - including those concerning the competitiveness and convergence of the European economy, and I say competitiveness and convergence because this is also about the convergence of our economies - every initiative, I said, must respect the Treaty as well as the principles and rules that have been established for the Union and for its institutions."
"The Commission will therefore take every initiative - legislative or otherwise - to guarantee consistency between the future stability mechanism and the economic governance carried out by the Union within the euro area."
"Respect for the Treaty is, of course, very important, and I am reassured that the European Council, on 4 February, explicitly recognised that."
"The mechanisms for reinforcing the competitiveness and convergence of the European economy, which apply not just to the 17 current members of the euro but to all the 27, will be created with due respect for the Treaties - that is, for the competences of the Union and of its institutions and, in particular, the competences of Parliament and the Commission."
"The opinion that the Commission has just adopted makes explicit mention of that."
"What we are talking about today is a question of general European interest."
"It is obvious that safeguarding the euro is not just in the interest of the Member States in the euro area."
"It is for this reason that the Member States which do not belong to the euro area can be involved, if they wish, in the work of introducing the permanent mechanism."
"They will also be able, if necessary, to decide to participate in the operations which will be implemented in the context of this future mechanism, as some have already done within the framework of the current temporary mechanisms."
"We are also talking today about our global response to the crisis, of which the establishment of the future European stability mechanism is one of the key elements."
"We must move forward quickly and properly on this subject."
"Urgency does not mean haste, and it certainly does not exclude taking time for joint reflection."
"The decisions that we will be taking in the coming weeks to implement the lessons of the crisis are fundamental decisions for our common future."
"We must therefore be very clear on the orientation to which we want to commit ourselves."
"We all agree that we must board the train of reform in order to preserve financial stability, to increase the competitiveness and convergence of our economies, and to release the full potential of sustainable growth which generates jobs."
"Now what remains is to determine the track on which we will make this train run, and I believe that, in order to make this European train move forward, the best tracks are EU ones."
"The way in which we will introduce the European stability mechanism will make a large contribution to answering this question."
"As far as the procedure is concerned, the Commission believes that the conditions have been met for undertaking a simplified revision of the Treaty such as that envisaged in Article 48(6) of the Treaty on European Union."
"I know that many of you are wondering about the highly intergovernmental character of this permanent mechanism."
"We, too, would have preferred more rapid progress that was more anchored in the system of the Union."
"However, we must recognise that this new step does not reduce the current competences of the Union and its institutions."
"It increases our collective capacity to respond to certain challenges which were not explicitly envisaged in the Treaty."
"I would like to emphasise here certain points of substance that were emphasised in the Commission's opinion."
"They will help us, I think, to orient ourselves towards a Union which shows more solidarity, a more responsible, united and strong Union."
"The first aspect is solidarity."
"Here, we are talking about a fundamental value of the European Union, and I want to be very precise on this point."
"Throughout the discussions on the limited draft modification to the Treaty, the Commission said that this modification would in no way harm the solidarity mechanisms provided for in Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the event of difficulties or a serious threat of difficulties in a Member State."
"As a consequence, and contrary to some people's opinions, Article 122 is not undergoing any modification."
"Solidarity in the Union also means responsibility."
"There could not be solidarity in Europe without responsibility; nor, of course, could there be responsibility without solidarity."
"This holds, in particular, for financial solidarity and responsibility, and this is the whole spirit of the transitional stability mechanisms."
"This will also be the spirit of the permanent mechanism, the conditions for which will be very strict."
"Let us be very clear: the Member States must all show respect for a responsible financial policy."
"Solidarity and responsibility within the European Union can only be enhanced by greater coordination and better supervision."
"That is the essential lesson that we have learned from the crisis."
"The economic governance carried out by the Union within the euro area will thus constitute the basis on which the future stability mechanism will necessarily have to rest."
"We will have to reinforce European economic governance; that is, we will have to enlarge and deepen it to guarantee the stability of the euro area in particular, and the stability of the European Union as a whole."
"Extending economic governance means including not only budgetary policies but also economic policies and structural reforms."
"That is the whole aim of the European semester on which we reached an agreement."
"This process was launched by the presentation of the Annual Growth Survey prepared by the Commission."
"This document says and shows clearly that the current policies are not sufficient."
"We must do more to respond to current challenges."
"We must do more together, and we must not be divided."
"We must do more to create more convergence, and not to create more differences."
"Regarding the deepening of economic governance, this is the very aim of the package of six proposals which was presented by the Commission."
"I know that we will be able to count on strong support for this from Parliament, and I thank you for this support."
"You can be assured that the Commission will support and facilitate this process up to completion so that our ambitions can be realised."
"It is precisely this package of reforms to which the future European stability mechanism will belong, as, in the more immediate future, will the reinforcement of the European financial stability fund."
"I am convinced that our approach is the right one, and that everyone has his or her role to play in it."
"The Commission will play its full role, and intends, in particular, to participate actively in the work of introducing the future European stability mechanism."
"Now, it is not enough to have the right approach; we must apply it."
"I think that we will succeed in implementing our approach if we all respect a few simple and clear rules of conduct."
"I am thinking here of democratic legitimacy based on scrutiny by the European Parliament."
"I am also thinking of the strength that we gain from permanent institutions, which act transparently and which are common institutions for the 27, also guaranteeing consistency across the Union."
"I am also thinking of the principle of equality of the Member States in the Treaty and the principle of fair competition, according to which the actions decided on by the Member States cannot affect, alter or harm the efficiency of the cooperation that takes place at European Union level."
"We will be vigilant in making sure that none of the carriages decouples, which would risk derailing the whole train."
"We must invest more in trust between the Member States, and between the Member States and the European institutions."
"We are a Union, and we must act as a Union in order to emerge from the crisis and to build solid foundations for a more competitive, more prosperous, more stable and more inclusive Europe."
"This is the spirit in which our actions must take place; this is the spirit in which the Commission has acted, and will continue to act."
"I think I can say that we can count on your support here."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are fully aware that we need a provision in the Treaty in order to bring about legal certainty."
"In my country, this is regarded as a constitutional necessity and this is why we are discussing the need for a modification to the Treaty so that we can guarantee the stability of the euro in the long term."
"There are many other possibilities involving more wide-ranging modifications to the Treaty which would incorporate this fully into community policy."
"Alternatively, we could use different wording at another point within the relevant article."
"On the other hand, there is then, of course, the risk that the simplified procedure could no longer be applied, which would result in referendums being needed."
"As a result, we would not be able to reach a decision in time, which would cause problems that would affect the financial markets."
"However, it is important to explain that the monetary union is a community power."
"We must ensure that this power is not undermined either by the stability mechanism or the competitiveness pact."
"The Treaty has deficiencies which can, unfortunately, only be resolved by taking an intergovernmental approach, because of the circumstances that have already been described."
"However, there are examples of Member States agreeing on joint regulations, such as in the enhanced cooperation procedure, but using the European Union institutions to carry out the necessary work."
"This should also be possible in this context and it concerns the Commission in particular."
"It would be wrong to establish parallel structures which would move increasingly far apart and prevent the community from remaining a cohesive whole in the long term."
"We must avoid this at all costs."
"If we do not react responsibly and correctly in the weeks to come, we could see a split starting to form."
"It must also be made clear that the community method and the intergovernmental method are not of equal importance."
"The intergovernmental method is simply an aid to be used when the community method is not available for reasons relating to the Treaty."
"Therefore, we must ensure that in the case of a possible treaty modification, the matter can be transferred to community policy without major problems, as we have done with Schengen and with many other examples in the past."
"This calls for a radical solution, which, at the same time, also provides clear legal structures, so that the countries which are not included can be certain that they will be involved when they fulfil the conditions."
"It must also guarantee that the small countries are on an equal footing, because we know that the community structures not only ensure cohesion but also decision-making ability in the long term."
"We have yet to find out how difficult the intergovernmental approach will be in the case of the competitiveness pact."
"There are three areas."
"The first of these is the stability and growth pact, which involves normal legislation and the community method."
"There is also the Treaty modification, which brings with it the risk of break up, and the competitiveness pact, which definitely needs further discussion."
"Parliament must demonstrate that it is responsible and we must do the same within our group."
"We know how important the date of 24 March and the following Monday are."
"I believe that we are not working towards an ideal solution, but if we act responsibly, the other institutions and, in particular, the Council should do the same."
"Our idea is that we should accept the intergovernmental approach as a transitional solution."
"This is connected with the powers of the institutions and, specifically, the Commission on this issue."
"The Council should be available for discussions over the next few days."
"This means that we are prepared to debate this question, in order to overcome the problems that we have in this House, because the small countries and the countries outside the euro area feel that they are at a disadvantage as a result of the specific way in which the competitiveness pact has been initiated."
"All of this makes our work difficult."
"I would like to help ensure that there is a majority in favour of this plan within the necessary deadline."
"I hope that the Council will give us the opportunity during the course of our discussions to put this majority together."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads for the future of the Europe Union."
"After the many delays that we are guilty of, it has become obvious to everyone that Europe needs real economic governance, which must be particularly stringent for those countries that have adopted the euro."
"We therefore welcome the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which we feel is a key point in the construction of genuine economic governance in Europe, even if we continue to nurture legal and political reservations on the procedure adopted, which we think is risky and does not make full use of the instruments provided for by the Treaty."
"I am delighted to hear that you also share these reservations."
"In any case, we are now focusing on a different point: how will the new mechanism actually work?"
"Will it contribute to strengthening the economic governance of the European Union or will it be a step towards a new (and inevitably discretional) 'intergovernmentalism', which is the direction that was also taken by the unfortunate wording of the Franco-German competitiveness pact?"
"Basically, in what direction is this train setting off?"
"Who will be driving it?"
"Indeed, on the one hand, the proposed amendment to Article 136 sets out an intergovernmental mechanism that is entirely disconnected from the Union and its institutions, while, on the other, we can read in the opinion of the Commission that the mechanism shall have to rely on economic governance exercised by the Union and that the Commission will take all measures to ensure consistency between the stability mechanism and the aforementioned economic governance."
"We do appreciate these intentions but, since there is no sign of any of this in the proposal to amend Article 136, we think that this is the time to clearly define how this mechanism will work."
"What procedure will be adopted to put the mechanism in place?"
"What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application?"
"What will be the composition of the secretariat?"
"What does the Council think about what Mr Barroso has just said on the validity of the current extraordinary solidarity mechanisms?"
"Will there be a role for the European Parliament?"
"I believe that only a rewording of the amendment to Article 136 or, alternatively, a clear declaration from the European Council on these issues, will enable Parliament to adopt an opinion in line with the desired schedule of the European Council."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Gualtieri whether it has occurred to him that intergovernmental cooperation would be a much better path for the peoples of Europe and the unemployed in Europe than the European superstate which he seems to be advocating?"
"Has that occurred to him?"
"(IT) Mr Present, ladies and gentlemen, I am a keen supporter of regard for the European Union and the competences assigned to it by the Treaties, which I believe also represent the best way to carry out our role as the direct representatives of the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, I think that we can be satisfied with Mr Barroso's statements on the amendment of the Treaty."
"Of course, it is now up to us to draft our opinion, and we must do so before 24 March, as an important Council meeting is taking place on this date."
"Can we reach a majority in favour of a simplified procedure?"
"We shall see."
"I think that there are still some conditions that need to be met."
"The first condition that occurs to me is that we need to try to ensure that the mechanism is managed by the Commission as far as possible."
"I have some good arguments for this."
"You will surely have noticed that on 6 January, the European financial stabilisation mechanism (EFSM), which is managed by the Commission, issued EUR 5 billion of bonds onto the market over five years."
"On 25 January, the European Financial Stability Facility, which is intergovernmental, did the same, also for EUR 5 billion and also over five years."
"The bonds that were managed by the Commission were issued at 2.5% and those that were managed by the intergovernmental system were put on the market at 2.89%."
"That means that the EFSM, which is managed under the Community method, is issuing bonds at lower interest rates than the intergovernmental system."
"I wanted to make this point because it is important to show that the Community method has much better outcomes than the intergovernmental system does."
"Secondly, I think that we must also ask ourselves if we can use the amendment of Article 136 in order to strengthen the economic governance package which is currently under discussion."
"Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other rapporteurs have tabled six proposals."
"In these six proposals, however, we still need the green light from the Council so that the procedures can be initiated by the Commission."
"This problem can also be resolved through Article 136."
"We could say that if Article 136 - that is, the permanent crisis mechanism - is invoked, the Commission will automatically be able to start this procedure, and that the Council will not be able to block this with a reversed qualified majority."
"Thus, there is a real automatic aspect to the penalties."
"That is a second observation that we will perhaps have to come back to in our opinion, as I have said to Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, the two rapporteurs for our committee."
"I would like to make a third and final comment."
"Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, as rapporteurs, you must try to obtain statements and assurances from the Council, not on the current package, but on all the things that have been announced in these last few days: the competitiveness pact, the intergovernmental method, the many countries who oppose this, etc."
"I think that we must have an assurance from the Council that it will also apply the Community method in this second economic governance package."
"Why is that?"
"It is because the intergovernmental method is not working."
"Imagine for a moment that the rules on competition in the European Union were managed by the Council!"
"How many times would fines have been given to businesses which failed to apply the competition rules?"
"A company or a private business would never have been fined because it had failed to apply the rules on competition in the European Union."
"The same is true of these rules, and that is why I am making a plea for the two rapporteurs to try to get an assurance that the Community method will also be applied in the second economic governance package."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it is clear that the European Parliament understands why the Treaty modification is based on the simplified procedure."
"We are dealing with an emergency situation."
"However, it is also obvious that the European Parliament is of the opinion that it is not right for the procedure which puts the crisis mechanism into effect to result in the community method coming to an end in future and the European Parliament and the Commission, at least in part, being excluded."
"I would also like to explain our very critical attitude to the increase in intergovernmentalism."
"I believe that at the moment, fewer and fewer European citizens understand what decisions are being made in each situation."
"The Germans have been set against the Greeks and the Greeks have been set against the Germans."
"The Irish believe that the German banks are being rescued at their expense."
"This failure to understand the situation has to do with the Council being a black box and with the fact that decisions are only taken at the last minute."
"We need more transparency in this area."
"Otherwise, we will lose the trust of the citizens faster than we can possibly imagine."
"Therefore, you should be prepared, if you want us to submit to the simplified procedure at this point, to reinforce Parliament's role as the representative of the citizens in the Council and the Commission, as everyone promised before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This Treaty and the case for more democracy in Europe were supported not only by you, Mr Barroso, but also by those in power in the Member States."
"I would now like to see this being put into practice."
"We only need to look at what is happening in Greece at the moment."
"There is a plan to privatise the beaches, so that Greece's debt can be serviced."
"This represents an end to the way in which the crisis has so far been dealt with."
"Focusing completely on a policy of austerity, which has been heavily promoted by Germany, will push these countries with budget deficits closer to the brink of disaster."
"We must evaluate what is being done."
"We need to discuss the structure of this crisis policy and the alleged policy of solidarity."
"How else can we ensure that there is a clear understanding anywhere in Europe of what still needs to be done in this crisis?"
"I would like to say one more thing at this point."
"I believe that we should be prepared to show solidarity with other countries in Europe."
"The funds that we currently have available are not sufficient."
"A decision was made in Brussels today to provide more liquidity."
"We will soon have to talk about this again and also about Eurobonds."
"Mr Verhofstadt has provided the correct justification for this."
"However, we will also need to discuss what we want our revenue policy to look like in future."
"I am sorry that I have overrun."
"However, we do ultimately need more time for this debate, so that we can reach a conclusion and not simply take a defensive approach."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I support this Treaty change and my group supports it, because we want to see stability within the eurozone."
"Although the United Kingdom is not a member of the euro - and I hope it never joins - we have a vested interest in its success."
"Half of the UK's trade is with eurozone countries."
"The City of London is the financial capital of Europe."
"So Britain wishes the eurozone well and we hope that the proposed stability mechanism will provide support in the short to medium term."
"My hope is that this Parliament will act responsibly and approve the change proposed by Council."
"But in the long term, if the euro is to survive and prosper, more radical change is necessary."
"Mr Barroso, you can have as much supervision and surveillance as you like, as much economic governance as you like, but fundamentally, if countries like Greece and Ireland and Portugal are to remain within the eurozone, they need to become a lot more competitive, as competitive as Germany, and that is where your Commission should concentrate its efforts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has only been in existence for a short time."
"However, it is now going to be modified for the second time in just a few months because of what is alleged to be an urgent matter."
"As a result, the Treaty modification will not follow the democratic process laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Instead, it will be decided by means of the fast-track procedure."
"We have seen how this procedure was used to allow the rescue packages for the banks, amounting to billions of euro, to bypass Parliament."
"Now the Council is once again under time pressure and many Heads of Government want the new Treaty modification to be implemented using the supposedly tried and tested fast-track procedure."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left opposes this approach, which is threatening to become a standard process, and is calling for Treaty modifications to be managed using the normal procedure, including the convention, laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, perhaps I could start at nought."
"It began by being a customs union pure and simple, then it became a political union, but without proper democratic consent, then it became a monetary union - well, sort of, because ten Member States have been sensible enough to stay out - but what we now have is a debt union, and it is a debt union which simply is not working."
"Let us look at the interest rate of the German Bund."
"If monetary union was working, all members of the monetary union, all countries in the eurozone, would be able to borrow money at the same rate - at the same rate as the key indicator, the German Bund - but that is not the case at all."
"Currently, Portugal pays 4.8% more, Ireland pays 5.9% more, and Greece pays 8.25% more."
"Exactly as Mr Gualtieri said, it is a crucial moment."
"I do not expect the Chairman of the PPE Group, or the Chairman of the S&D Group - who was shaking his head as I spoke - to understand the critical importance of this, but I believe that very soon they will have to."
"Your problem, and it is mostly your problem, would be better solved by intergovernmental cooperation."
"Economic governance is a trap and moreover, it has no mandate."
"Nobody ever mentioned, or even seems to consider, the hard-pressed taxpayers of the nation state as you seek to construct this fragile and vain empire."
"Once again, I would remind you that there are 27 Member States: 11 of them are net contributors and 16 of them are recipients, and there is a San Andreas fault between those who contribute and those who do not."
"I suspect that most of all, the German taxpayer will not put up with this expensive charade for very much longer."
"In 1896, William Jennings Bryan, in a great speech about bimetallism, said, 'You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold'."
"Now more urgently, I say to you today, and most of all to the President of the Commission, who has the executive power: you shall not crucify the taxpayers of the UK and the rest of Europe on the cross of the single currency."
"(FR) Mr President, I would first like to talk about the scandal that is the so-called 'simplified' procedure - in reality a treacherous one - for amending the Treaty."
"There is no real debate and, as usual, no direct consultation with the people."
"This is not an innocuous subject, however."
"This is about making the European financial stabilisation fund permanent."
"What does this fund represent, though, other than the possibility of creating a European debt, to be eventually taken on by the Member States, which are already in too much debt, and which could find themselves obliged to cover this European debt before covering their own debts?"
"In a way, this is the economic policy of Sapeur Camember - the main character of a humorous book in France - the soldier who is ordered to fill in the hole in the barracks yard and who, in order to fill it in, creates another one right next to it."
"In exchange for Germany's participation, we will be permitted a pact, termed a competitiveness pact, the details of which, according to a note from the French Government's Secretariat-General for European Affairs, were not supposed to be known."
"In fact, they are known only too well."
"This will be a cure involving real austerity, supervision and an increased standardisation of budgetary policies."
"This is about extending convergence, I quote, to all policies which have an impact on competitiveness, even if, in principle, they fall under national competences."
"In short, this is about transposing to the entire euro area all those German policies of which Mr Sarkozy dreams so much."
"There is nothing acceptable about this, any more than there is about the alternative of a homogeneous European sovereign debt market plus an increase in the European budget and the creation of a specific tax to fund it."
"We must do something else."
"First of all, I would like to thank you for your speeches, and I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for their comments concerning the importance of the Community method, as well as their attentiveness to what might become an intergovernmental drift."
"I can only thank them for this attentiveness."
"In this specific case, let us be absolutely clear: the Commission has given its support to this revision because we think that it aims to respond to a challenge regarding a competence which was not provided for by the Treaty."
"The Treaty did not establish a permanent stability mechanism."
"The Member States thus unanimously decided to create a mechanism and to do so on an intergovernmental basis."
"This was a unanimous decision by the Member States."
"I make no secret of the fact - and I have said very clearly - that I will be with all those who want to move more quickly on this."
"An intergovernmental step might represent progress, but we would rather move more quickly in an intergovernmental stride."
"As we know, however, some of the great steps forward for Europe in the history of European integration have begun with intergovernmental initiatives, such as Schengen or the area of freedom and justice, for example."
"The question regarding political responsibility was thus the following: do we, or do we not, have to support something which, while not being absolutely in line with our preferences - that is, the Community method - nevertheless involves the strengthening of our collective ability to respond to challenges which were not explicitly provided for in the Treaty?"
"Our answer to this is 'yes';"
"I think that we have to be in favour of this."
"That is why the Commission's opinion is positive regarding this reform of the Treaty."
"However, I would like to say to you very openly that the Commission prefers the Community approach."
"Incidentally, this is the debate that we had during the preparation of this decision."
"Some people wanted - and even proposed - a modification of Article 122, which would abolish a competence that has been in existence since the Treaties of Rome."
"I personally opposed this."
"I therefore think we can say that we can now develop this new competence together, even if, strictly speaking, it does not come under the Community method."
"At the same time, however, we say very clearly in our opinion, and I quote: 'The Commission will take every initiative, whether legislative or of any other kind, to ensure consistency between the future mechanism and the Union's economic governance in the euro area in particular, while respecting the competences conferred on the Union and its institutions by the Treaty '."
"This is an absolutely clear position, and I would like to share this aim with you."
"During the debate, some people talked, for example, about opposition or differences between one Member State and the others, between the United Kingdom and the euro area."
"Normally, I do not like to make this distinction, but there are some differences, the main one, incidentally, being the fact that the debt of the euro area is much less than that of the United Kingdom."
"The debt of the United Kingdom is much higher than that of the euro area as a whole."
"That is why the problem that exists in the euro area - as some of you have already stressed, by the way - is genuinely a problem of relative competitiveness."
"That is why we are now looking to find a solution for competitiveness and for convergence - and I stress convergence - in the Union."
"Even if some people do not agree, let us move towards greater convergence in the euro area and in the Union for those who want to move forward, because now it is not just the federalists or the integrationists who want more governance in the European Union."
"The markets are also asking for such governance, and we need to listen to that."
"Today, the markets are asking Europe not only to be determined to defend the euro area, but also to provide a clearer system of governance."
"It is true, furthermore, that the Community approach normally gives more of a guarantee than an approach which is too often left up to the goodwill of the leaders."
"(Applause)"
"We are now working in this direction on other projects, notably, this project on competitiveness and convergence, but that will be another debate for another day."
"In any case, I believe that, on this matter, the Commission has adopted the right position: expressing a clear opinion in favour of this limited revision of the Treaty, while asking everyone to be more attentive to the need to avoid creating mechanisms which, as Mr Brok, for example, has said, could create divisions, because it is the Community institutions that can guarantee the Union as a whole, because the Commission takes actions for the euro area as well as for those Member States that are not in the euro area."
"Let us therefore be attentive to this aspect."
"Let us not, motivated by the need to respond to urgent challenges, now create issues which could bring up more significant problems for us in the future."
"Let us guarantee a firmer governance while guaranteeing the union as a whole in the spirit which must, of course, be the spirit of the Union: the spirit of solidarity and responsibility."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Barroso, the necessary Treaty modification and the institutional debate that we are holding both demonstrate that, now the Treaty of Lisbon has been in force for just over a year, we can no longer resolve the challenges which the world is presenting us with by means of the Treaty as it currently stands."
"That is exactly what today's debate shows."
"On the other hand, when we talk about the current Treaty, we are told that a wider debate about the Treaty is inconceivable and futile in the light of the situation in the Member States and, in particular in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic."
"That is the conflict which we currently find ourselves in."
"We need more, but we will not be getting it from the Member States."
"The European Parliament must provide an answer."
"If we listen to what the citizens are saying today, it is clear that they are aware that we need to introduce changes to the Treaty now."
"They are asking questions like: 'How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future?'."
"This is why we need a strong Europe."
"However, we must ask ourselves an even more important question, which is: What good is our European project doing at the end of the day?"
"For decades, it has been responsible for peacekeeping and for bringing war on our continent to an end."
"This morning, I was host to a group of visitors from a school."
"For young people, war is, thank goodness, no longer an issue."
"They cannot imagine what war might be like."
"In our discussions, we now raise the threat of globalisation and explain that we need Europe to keep the evil of globalisation under control, but this is a negative argument."
"If we want to win over not only the minds, but also the hearts of the people, we must take a step further on the question of what good the European project is doing."
"We must talk about the pictures and ask ourselves what Europe is achieving and what its job is."
"When the powerful countries in the world come together, including America, Japan, Europe, Brazil, India and so on, who will raise their hand and ask whether we are paying enough attention to social issues?"
"China will not do so."
"We will have to do that ourselves."
"Who will raise their hand and say 'We need to think about environmental questions'?"
"The Americans will not do that."
"We will have to highlight the issue."
"Who will say 'We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars'?"
"We will have to do this with our historical experience."
"If we look at Tunisia, it is clear that the people there want the same model which we have in Europe."
"We have a highly attractive way of life."
"Therefore, when we discuss Treaty issues, when we talk about the way in which our continent functions and the job that we have to do, we must look at the big picture, so that we win not only the minds, but also the hearts of people for our project."
"Then, we will succeed in gaining acceptance for it at a national level."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Weber for taking my question, which I would hope that perhaps President Barroso might also answer, because it is primarily directed at him."
"I support the intention behind this Treaty change."
"Like others, I am concerned about the mechanism."
"But the simplified procedure provides that all national parliaments, all 27 national parliaments, must acquiesce at least in the adoption of this Treaty change."
"National parliaments are given six months to decide what they may do."
"We are talking about adopting a decision in March, a Council decision that was made in December."
"How can that possibly be the case?"
"Surely they have to wait until June to make that decision?"
"(DE) Mr President, on the one hand, it is important that the Member States are in control of the treaties, which is why the modification must take place at this level."
"On the other hand, we are faced with the question which is implicit in many of the questions that I have attempted to address."
"Are we reflecting carefully on this, are we taking enough time and being allowed enough time to discuss everything in detail?"
"Or are people's expectations so high and the pressure of the global challenges so great that we need to be quicker and to act more quickly?"
"For this reason, I do not regard the issue of time as a problem, but we do need to provide answers."
"We must focus on that."
"The next speaker on the list is Mr Martin Schulz, from whom I have received a letter."
"If there is any misunderstanding over the order on the list, I can explain it after our debate."
"(DE) Mr President, it is a letter addressed to you personally, not to the Chamber."
"Treaty modifications are always complex, even simplified ones."
"What we are discussing here shows that we are in an extremely difficult situation."
"The term 'simplified procedure' conceals the fact that it is possible for this type of procedure to fail."
"It can fail here and also elsewhere."
"We have been told that if it fails, we will be in a very difficult position."
"Therefore, we need to ask ourselves once again what we can do to ensure that it does not fail."
"It is true that we are being listened to."
"Whether just the ratification procedure fails or also the euro project as a whole will depend on the determination of the Heads of Government to take coherent and united action."
"A lot of valid remarks have already been made in this respect."
"I would like to add three points which are of fundamental importance."
"Today, a year after the start of this serious crisis, I would like to ask you what the external value of our currency is."
"The answer to that question is USD 1.35."
"When the euro was first introduced, the same figure was USD 1.17."
"Now it has reached USD 1.35."
"The value of an international currency is based on its external value."
"Over the last year, the external value of the euro has been highly stable."
"However, the internal structure of the euro is not at all stable."
"This is because of the wildly ambiguous attitude and the double standards of the Heads of State or Government."
"The problem is not that Europe cannot act in a consistent way."
"After all, the instruments are in place."
"The problem is that Europe cannot agree on a consistent procedure."
"When we say that Europe cannot agree, we should also add 'not those of us here'."
"It is not the European Parliament or the Commission; it is the governments of the sovereign Member States which have created a strong monetary area that is able to take external action, but which are not prepared to create the self-contained, internal instruments needed to establish a strong economic and social policy and a strong government policy alongside the strong currency."
"That is the crucial point."
"Secondly, everything that happens in Europe takes place in the context of the treaties."
"However, when something happens within the treaties and we do not want to create something arbitrarily outside the bounds of the treaties, because some people are considering doing this, it is clear to the European Parliament that the institution at the heart of this must be the central institution within the framework of the treaties, namely the Commission."
"The democratic legitimacy of our actions at European level, in direct relation to the European Parliament, is determined by the Commission."
"This is why what you have explained is right, in the same way as what the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, have also said."
"My third point is that the risk for Europe lies in the fact that it is strong when it acts in a consistent way as the largest economic area in the world, with 500 million inhabitants, but if it allows itself to break down into 27 individual parts, it becomes irrelevant."
"Regrettably, this became clear during the events on the other side of the Mediterranean."
"If Europe does not take a consistent line, then it has no role to play."
"If it takes a consistent line, then with its social and economic model, it will become the engine of the global economy and an influential partner on the international political stage."
"The issue that we are discussing in the context of this simplified procedure concerns whether Europe has a future or whether it will break down into individual states and descend into unimportance and irrelevance."
"That is the point which we are debating."
"(CS) Mr President, whatever our relationship is to the single currency, the euro, I believe it is in the interests of everyone living in the EU that the euro and the euro area develop in a stable way, whether we use it or not, as our economies are interlinked to an enormous extent."
"Nevertheless, when President Barroso described the European stability mechanism, he used words such as improved supervision, expansion of economic coordination, coordination of budgetary policies and harmonisation of social policies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this opens the way to the creation of fiscal union, and economic history shows us that fiscal union never survives long without the creation of political union."
"The minor change we are discussing today is therefore a massive change for the individual Member States of the EU."
"The European Union is being politically transformed for the future."
"Mr Weber said that 'European citizens want to see a stronger Europe'."
"We have known that here the whole time."
"Let us ask them, because European citizens have, for decades, simply accepted, and not decided, what happens in European institutions."
"Mr President, a new stability mechanism is proposed."
"In the election campaign in Ireland, those parties likely to form the new government are promising a major renegotiation of the existing EU-IMF austerity plan, lessening its severity."
"But this is mere speculation and it is unjust and anti-democratic that the Irish people are asked to vote for a fog of conjecture."
"I wanted to ask Mr Barroso, as President of the Commission, not to intervene in the Irish election campaign, but to vindicate the democratic right of the Irish people to factual information and to the truth."
"Commissioner Rehn said yesterday that renegotiation of the EU-IMF deal appeared to be possible, but I have four specific questions."
"Firstly, is renegotiation possible immediately on a new government taking office in Ireland and before the new mechanism of 2013?"
"Secondly, would this mean substantial reductions in the brutal levels of interest charged?"
"Thirdly, would the financial speculators be forced to take their own losses rather than crucifying the Irish people?"
"Fourthly, does he understand that only a renegotiation that reverses cuts and provides substantial public investment in jobs will resolve our crisis in Ireland, while more cuts and austerity will wreck our society?"
"Mr President, well, here we go again."
"The failed political project that is the euro has led us to amend the Lisbon Treaty twice in its short life."
"We should remember, of course, that the Lisbon Treaty was bludgeoned through the referendum in Ireland."
"The Irish people said 'no' but they were lied to; they were told that their economy would be protected, but they were misled, and now, as the European Union does when it encounters a problem, it does not take a step back to ask 'what have we done wrong?'"
"No, you want further integration and you want the small states to suffer more."
"You wish to fine them if they get into further difficulties, which will then put them in more difficulties and make them more subject to your European empire."
"I want to say this to Mr Barroso: yes, the UK may have a debt problem, but it is not helped by having to bail out eurozone countries like Ireland when we have had to borrow the money to do that in the first place."
"Mr President, changing the Treaty is not something we should enter into lightly, especially given the fact that the Lisbon Treaty took considerable work and negotiation."
"Therefore, this Parliament and the Council must be very restrained in how we now set about amending it."
"This change is necessary in order to protect weaker eurozone economies."
"However, the positions of those Member States who are not part of the euro must also be upheld."
"This Treaty change will not solve the failure of Member States to live up to their agreements under the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It will not solve the underlying problems of huge public deficits, nor will it make the EU more competitive on a global stage."
"It is merely a stop-gap measure that should give us more time to get the individual eurozone and our collective houses in order."
"Each of the EU Member States needs to look at its own public spending and tax policies and devise realistic programmes to reinvigorate our economies."
"One line of text added into an international agreement, although necessary, will be no substitute for real reform and prudence."
"Therefore, a real strategy for global competitiveness needs to emerge."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the participants in the debate and the Members of the European Parliament for their clear support for a communitarian approach, for a strong European Union, and for an appropriate role in the future mechanism which we are discussing today."
"Our opinion was very clear, which is that we fully support the creation of the European stabilisation mechanism and see it as a very important part of the mosaic for a stronger and more economically prosperous Europe."
"We are working on increased supervision of financial markets, on better economic governance, with our six legislative proposals on the table."
"We started the first European semester with our annual growth survey, and this should be the last piece of the puzzle."
"I also think that with this and with our debate today, and what I believe will be a positive decision in March, we are sending very clear signals to all those who are betting against the euro."
"If you bet against the euro, you will lose your money."
"That is a very important message to send out."
"Therefore, the decision on this issue will be absolutely crucial, but I know that for this House, it is also very important that we respect fully the competences of the Union, we respect fully the prerogatives and role of the Union's institutions."
"Of course, the Commission will definitely see to it that European law is always respected."
"As we stated in our opinion, the Commission also stands ready to use its expertise in handling these mechanisms, because I believe that they should be in full coherence with improved economic governance, especially as regards the coordination and surveillance of economic and financial policies in the Member States, in particular, those of the eurozone."
"Some of you have been concerned that we should not create a two-tier Europe."
"I think that the Commission's position on this is also very clear: even though the primary responsibility for the euro currency remains with the eurozone Member States, it is very clear that any future cooperation mechanism must be open to others and that all the work we are doing to increase competitiveness and convergence must be for all 27 Member States."
"So I believe that the process which we are going through, and in which financial markets also played a role in accelerating our integration, in accelerating our cooperation in the field of economic governance, should be very much welcomed, because it is definitely making our Union stronger."
"I would like to thank particularly the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for their close cooperation, for the ideas which have been brought to the table, and for the consultations which the Commission has with the two rapporteurs on an ongoing basis."
"I believe that their good work will lead to a report which will be approved by this House in time, before the decision of the European Council is taken."
"My last remark is to Mr Higgins from Ireland."
"He very correctly pointed to the quote from Commissioner Rehn, stating that the agreement was struck with Ireland - not with the government but with Ireland as a country."
"Of course, we expect that any future government would respect the deal."
"Having said that, it is very clear and it is very obvious that the Commission is very sympathetic to the current difficulties that Ireland is going through and will do its utmost to support a swift return to growth in Ireland."
"The European institutions - be it the European Union, the Commission, or the European Central Bank, or indeed the IMF - have contributed a lot to stabilising the situation in Ireland."
"I am sure that all together, we will do our utmost to bring back growth and prosperity to Ireland as well."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"This debate has made it clear that the European Commission is committed to continuing along the road on which it started out with the undemocratic way of gaining approval for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It should be remembered that, following the rejection of the so-called European constitution by the citizens of France and the Netherlands, the leaders of the European Union did everything they could to avoid further referenda."
"Even after the first rejection from Ireland, they exerted every possible pressure in order to ensure that, after some time had passed, a new referendum took place."
"Now, some months having passed since the new Treaty entered into force, here they are, once again, trying to change things quickly without any kind of public debate, for fear of the reactions of citizens of the various Member States of the European Union, in particular, those which are suffering the consequences of increasingly neoliberal policies."
"Now, they wish to make recourse to the so-called 'simplified procedure' in order to hide the fact that they are, in fact, changing an important issue which is linked to constitutionalisation, with a view to its transformation into a permanent fund, of the European Financial Stability Fund, with the inadmissible conditions contained in the so-called competitiveness pact and its severe consequences upon social policies: the devaluation of salaries and pensions, and the increase in retirement age."
"State of European asylum system, after the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the state of the European asylum system, following the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Court of Human Rights ruling of 21 January on the case of M.S.S. versus Greece and Belgium clearly showed that the EU urgently needs to establish a common European asylum system and that we need to support Member States in meeting their obligation to provide adequate international protection."
"The Commission has always said that in the application of the EU acquis - and the Dublin regulation is an important element of the current EU acquis on asylum - Member States are never discharged of the obligation to ensure the protection of fundamental rights."
"The European Court of Justice recalled that principle in its judgment."
"The judgment does not affect the underlying principles of the functioning of the Dublin system: to have a clear system to identify which Member State is responsible, to examine an asylum application, to guarantee effective access to the procedures of determining refugee status, and to prevent abuse of asylum procedures in the form of multiple applications."
"However, the evaluation of the Dublin system made by the Commission has shown that there is room for improvement."
"Already in 2008, the Commission proposed a revised Dublin regulation to address the identified gaps."
"It aimed to increase both the standards of protection for the asylum applicants concerned, as well as the level of efficiency of the Dublin system for the benefit of the Member States."
"I welcome the European Parliament's strong support for the Commission proposals and I invite the Council and the European Parliament to work together for a balanced compromise leading to an improved Dublin 2 regulation."
"Such a compromise must also include an emergency mechanism for suspension of transfers in situations of exceptional and particular pressure on the asylum system as a matter of last resort."
"It would provide a common, comprehensive solution to cases which today are treated in a discretionary manner in order to build more trust and a genuine support between the Dublin partners."
"The Commission has been aware of the deficiencies of the Greek asylum system, which is confronted with exceptional pressure due to high numbers of mixed migration flows on its territory and the lack of a proper functioning national asylum system."
"We have already taken steps to review them."
"The Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Greece in November 2009, setting out concerns about various provisions of EU law."
"Greece itself has committed to reforming its asylum system, based on an action plan submitted to the Commission in August last year setting out immediate and long-term measures."
"Since then, important legislative developments have taken place in Greece."
"At the same time, the Commission is engaged in substantial efforts towards assisting Greece, together with the Member States, the UNHCR and EU agencies."
"This support combines significant financial and practical assistance for the reform of the national asylum system, border and return management, and more efficient use of the EU funds for migration management and also better cooperation with neighbouring countries, in particular, Turkey."
"Let me finish by recalling that our Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights."
"Asylum is one of the human rights which the European Union is committed to respecting and promoting."
"The Commission is firmly committed to working towards a fair, efficient and protection-oriented common European asylum system."
"That is the best way to jointly uphold human rights as one of the important pillars of the area of freedom, justice and security."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, asylum policy is a highly topical issue, as we have recently discovered in Lampedusa and in Greece."
"It is a subject that concerns the people of Europe."
"We should be proud of what we have achieved in Europe, including our common standards, the proper processing of asylum applications and our way of dealing with children and families."
"We should be proud of all of this."
"Europe is an area which offers help and partnership to people suffering persecution all over the world."
"However, the decisive factor is not what we put on paper in Parliament's committees, in the Commission and in the Council, but what actually happens on the ground."
"Belgium and Greece have recently been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for not implementing and not adhering to existing legislation."
"This makes it clear that the enforcement process is not working."
"I would like to ask the Commission to make faster progress, alongside its existing action plans."
"We need to be able to put in place and implement the important standards more quickly within the European Union."
"In the specific case of Greece, I would like to point out that we have a border that can be secured from both sides."
"I am disappointed in the way our partner, Turkey, has behaved in this respect."
"We have signed a readmission agreement with Turkey, which requires the country to do far less than it would have to if it were a member of the European Union."
"Therefore, I think we should expect Turkey to make a greater effort in this area."
"No one disputes our sense of solidarity."
"We want to provide practical help in the form of the European Refugee Fund and Frontex, both in the case of Greece, where aid is already being provided, and in the case of Lampedusa in Italy."
"European solidarity is not being called into question."
"It is needed now more than it ever has been."
"Mr President, as the Court judgment has illustrated, we are all trapped in Dublin II."
"As a result of the unequal distribution of responsibility, Member States have been in an argument about who is responsible and complaints have been flying back and forth for years now, with the unfortunate refugees trapped in the middle."
"Recently, 90% of immigrants and asylum seekers in Europe have arrived via Greece."
"Now, with Algeria, the pressure has shifted to Italy."
"How long are certain parties going to insist on pretending that this is a Greek, Italian, Maltese or Cypriot problem?"
"Our borders are the European borders."
"Our development policy, our foreign policy, or rather the lack thereof, are European issues."
"My country has recently made huge steps towards improving the asylum situation, with solid assistance from the European Commission."
"However, this is obviously not enough."
"The new Dublin regulation must put a stop to mass returns to the first Member State."
"Proper, fundamental solidarity must be established between the Member States."
"That is what Parliament has called for."
"The time has come for some members of the Council to stop playing Pontius Pilate and washing their hands."
"Mr President, the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that Belgium and Greece have contravened Articles 3 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Thus, both of these countries are guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment of an Afghan asylum seeker as he was transferred from Belgium to Greece."
"Unfortunately, this case is not at all unique."
"However, the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights is precedential and therefore important."
"As Parliament's rapporteur for the review of the Dublin II regulation, I welcome this ruling."
"It demonstrates, with the clarity that is required, that all Member States must stop transferring people to Greece while the situation there continues to be as it is today."
"It also demonstrates the need for European solidarity."
"If we are serious about creating a common asylum system by 2012, we need to share the responsibility and help each other."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether this ruling changes the Commission's view of the Dublin system as a cornerstone of the common asylum system and I would like to know whether the Commission has access to the statistics that indicate the grounds on which the Member States base their transfer decisions."
"It is important that we avoid more cases like this one."
"Parliament has a clear view on the Dublin regulation and we are now waiting impatiently to be able to start the negotiations."
"Our priorities are the issue of custody, the solidarity mechanism, the rights of minors and stronger provisions regarding judicial remedy."
"I look forward to your response, Mrs Malmström, and to the continuation of our excellent cooperation."
"Mr President, the question is: so, what do we do, now that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has said, 'You must not send any more asylum seekers back to Greece'?"
"The Minister for Justice in my country, the Netherlands, came up with a proposed solution."
"He said: 'We will take very rapid action to help the Greeks monitor their borders more strictly, set up their asylum system, and then we can just send any Dublin claimants back to Greece'."
"Of course, that is not, ultimately, any solution, at all."
"Because, in this House, all the parties, right across the political spectrum, have said that we need to introduce a solidarity clause into the Dublin system."
"If that does not happen, southerly countries will always have a harder deal than my own country, on the North Sea, which does not see so very many refugee boats landing on its shores."
"From the influx of immigrants into Lampedusa, Commissioner, we can see that, even if you are capable of working very hard to monitor your borders, you also have to be prepared for unexpected events."
"Do you agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that the Dublin system is now in tatters and when can we can see some momentum towards changing the Dublin system?"
"Do you agree with us here that what goes around comes around and that the northerly countries are now being forced to show solidarity?"
"I would also like to hear your opinion on last week's ruling of the Court in Strasbourg, which states that the number of Rule 39 cases, that is, applications for the suspension of deportation, increased by 4 000% last year, because people can see that Dublin is just not working."
"The last thing I would say is that, in the case between Maritime Support Services (MSS) and the Belgian authorities, the final findings were that the Belgian authorities were at fault."
"They had to pay the greatest financial claim."
"They were negligent. When can we expect changes to the Dublin system, so that these people are no longer exposed to inhuman conditions?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, Mrs Sargentini, why did I not hear you say that it is Turkey which is behaving badly, by allowing all those people to enter Turkey in the first place?"
"Why did I not hear you say that the over-complex European asylum legislation is being abused by so many people, by people traffickers and fortune seekers, solely and utterly because it is too complicated."
"Why are you not saying that?"
"(NL) Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity to answer this question."
"I think that we should first look for the beam in our own eye."
"Europe has made a mess of its own asylum system."
"As long as we continue to do that and as long as we remain unwilling to help Greece get the asylum seekers off its back, once and for all, and to ensure that we all have a uniform procedure for assessing whether or not someone is a genuine political refugee, we will never be in a position to shift the blame onto others."
"I agree with you, Mr Madlener, that human traffickers should be arrested and that Turkey really should set up a decent asylum system, a system that recognises political refugees who do not come from the European Union, but from elsewhere."
"Having said that, I would first look for the beam in our own eye and put our own house in order."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that it is clear we are dealing with a system which is broken."
"What is clear is that the European courts and European legislation are in conflict."
"We are no longer dealing with a situation where a law is being implemented, but rather it is being interpreted in a novel way."
"I believe that the European Union is best equipped to deal with the challenges of immigration through a nuanced system which is not dictatorial, not through more harmonised European legislation or the moral rulings of the European courts, but instead through solidarity, cooperation and good communication among European neighbours."
"We must be mindful that whatever burden is relieved in one place is not just moved to another."
"Of course, we have a duty to other EU Member States and to people seeking a safer and a freer life, but the recent Court ruling points at larger problems, which are the relationship between the European courts, European legislators and the Member States and their control of their own borders."
"Commissioner, I would be interested to know how the Commission is attempting to confront these issues in the long term."
"Could you please reassure this House that we will not just turn to the creation of more EU legislation, which no doubt at some point in the future will itself be overturned by a European court, but instead tell us how we can effectively support Greece and other Member States that are currently operating under such burdens?"
"Mr President, first of all, a word of thanks and support for Commissioner Malmström."
"She rightly called on Member States last week to take action again on the whole asylum package."
"Indeed, it is not an à la carte menu."
"The sudden influx of Tunisian refugees is fresh evidence of this."
"Italy is having the greatest of difficulties in ensuring that proper reception and asylum procedures are followed."
"If the other Member States continue to just stand by and watch, it will only be a matter of time before the European Court of Human Rights concludes that the transfer of asylum applications to Italy should be suspended, as, in fact, it did in the case of Greece."
"It is therefore in everybody's interests that we develop an emergency procedure within the framework of the Dublin system, as indeed the Commission proposed, and that we quickly put in place ​​binding agreements on reception and a high quality asylum procedure."
"I would like to hear from the Commissioner whether she thinks that the relevant MEPs could be of further assistance to her, in terms of persuading the Member States to finally take this much-needed action."
"In any case, she can count on my commitment."
"(NL) Mr President, the Netherlands is once again having to clean up Greece's mess!"
"First, Dutch taxpayers had to pay billions of euro to bail out this nearly bankrupt country, and now we are saddled with two thousand asylum seekers from Greece whom we are not allowed to send back."
"The Netherlands does not want those asylum seekers."
"The Netherlands has suffered enough, and continues to suffer, from mass immigration and the failed multicultural experiment."
"The Netherlands wants fewer immigrants who have no prospects and Europe has to start pursuing a much more stringent immigration policy."
"Otherwise, Europe will end up becoming Eurabia."
"However, Greece is also the victim of its bad neighbour, Turkey."
"Greece should therefore build a wall to keep out Turkish emigrants and emigrants which Turkey is allowing to transit its territory."
"We should punish Turkey, of course, for providing illegal immigrants with a passage to Greece."
"Finally, the European asylum legislation should be a great deal more stringent."
"Let us be honest: 99% of asylum seekers are, in fact, not asylum seekers at all, but economic fortune seekers abusing our asylum laws."
"(EL) Mr President, I shall continue the debate with the following hypothesis: we have seen the unrest in the Mediterranean and Arab countries."
"We know that many citizens of these countries hope to find a better fate in Europe."
"This is already a fact of life and I fear that the hypothesis I am about to develop will soon become another fact of life."
"Citizens leave these third countries for Europe."
"They arrive in Lampedusa - we have seen the problems that have arisen there - or try to reach Greece via Turkey, exploiting the facility not to apply for a visa based on the agreements which many of these third countries have with Turkey."
"Others go to Malta, some probably go to Portugal and Spain."
"Then some of them apply for asylum."
"It goes without saying that here again, Dublin II will be applied."
"We know that, even though some asylum seekers then appeal on these issues, again there will be convictions, just as we have had to date, by national courts, before we even get to a European Court ruling."
"So let us not pretend otherwise."
"Then there is this: some are arrested and will not be entitled to asylum."
"I am sure you know that, based on the agreement on which the Commission has just announced the end of negotiations, in order for those who enter via Turkey to be returned to Turkey under readmission, we will need to wait two years for the agreement to apply plus three years, which is the transitional period for third country nationals, giving a total of five years."
"In other words, those arrested during that period, based on the crisis we are facing, will need to wait until 2016 or 2017 for Turkey to take them back."
"Allow me to say that, with this sort of management, I fear that Europe is not up to the job at the moment."
"(FR) Mr President, I think that it is always useful to remind ourselves of a number of commitments, and particularly the one made in October 2008, via the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which announced that it was time to take new initiatives to complete the introduction of a common European asylum system, and thus to offer a higher level of protection within the European Union."
"More than two years after this promise, the Commission's proposals are on the negotiating table."
"One cannot help but notice, however, that this European asylum system and the harmonisation process are struggling somewhat to see the light of day."
"The recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights is an important turning point, in my opinion."
"Obviously, it highlights the failures of the Greek asylum system, but it also sends a strong message at a time when Greece is starting to reform its asylum system and, at the same time, to take other types of initiatives."
"Aside from this particular situation, however, this decision more generally calls into question the European asylum system as a whole, particularly regarding one of its fundamental components - the Dublin regulation - and its main premise, the equivalence of national asylum systems within the Union."
"This decision shows how, paradoxically, the common European asylum system has created a kind of injustice, both for asylum seekers and for the Member States."
"Following this decision, clear measures are now needed immediately."
"Pending an operational asylum system in Greece, the Member States must suspend returning asylum seekers to Greece and use the sovereignty clause of this regulation which allows them to take responsibility for examining an application."
"The European Court of Human Rights' (ECHR) decision also sends a signal to all parties concerned."
"I think that this decision should serve as a catalyst in the process of harmonisation and redrafting, in particular, when it comes to the Dublin regulation."
"First of all, this is, of course, about the mechanism for suspending transfers that I have just mentioned, which is being proposed by the Commission."
"The ECHR's decision sheds new light on this mechanism, on the one hand, and on intra-European solidarity, on the other."
"The suspension should restart discussions on the need for a suspension mechanism, as I mentioned, under conditions which are clearly specified."
"Secondly, aside from this mechanism, the suspension must also serve as a lever - or at least, I hope it will - to provide support, during the negotiations, for the other amendments to the regulation that are being proposed by the Commission, as well as those on the guarantees given in this instrument, among others."
"Finally, the suspension by the ECHR should allow us to start thinking about the inherent vulnerability of the situation that asylum seekers find themselves in."
"It should also make it necessary to bring in an appeal mechanism to suspend transfer of asylum seekers who are subject to a transfer decision resulting from the application of the Dublin regulation."
"Today, many of the warning lights are red; they are telling us that it is time to reform this regulation and to construct a true common asylum system founded on solidarity and responsibility."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we are talking today about the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights."
"This is ultimately about Belgium, but it concerns every Member State of the European Union."
"Germany has also decided no longer to send asylum seekers back to Greece."
"As one of my fellow Members has mentioned, we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum, something which I, as a Liberal, strongly support."
"However, this also means that we must give every asylum seeker the chance of a properly organised process."
"We must realise that it is unfair and shows a lack of solidarity if we allow the southern countries to bear the entire burden alone."
"Because of their geographical position, these countries have been exposed to an increased influx of refugees."
"In Lampedusa, this is because of current events in Tunisia."
"However, this is also an ongoing situation which the local asylum authorities cannot cope with."
"The recent liberalisation with regard to Kosovo also resulted in a huge influx of asylum seekers into Germany just a few weeks ago."
"We also had the problem that we could not initially process all the applications properly."
"Therefore, if we really want to retain this right to asylum, we must restructure the system to ensure that it offers greater solidarity in future."
"Dublin II cannot continue in its current form."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Afghan citizen referred to in the judgment of the Court of Human Rights was not an immigrant, was not abusing the system and was not a victim of human trafficking."
"Moreover, he was not covered by the Geneva Convention because he was not persecuted."
"He was an asylum seeker, so he would have had subsidiary protection and international protection."
"The judgment is therefore important due to the precedent that it sets."
"How many people could be awaiting judgments having appealed against denied asylum applications?"
"How many people could apply for compensation due to delays in proceedings?"
"What would happen if there were more than a thousand judgments by the Court of Human Rights against Member States?"
"What would happen to Europe's reputation?"
"Can we continue to consider ourselves to be champions of fundamental rights if we treat asylum seekers who are fleeing wars worse than if they were criminals?"
"Commissioner, asylum seekers can be awaiting proceedings in detention centres - if they are refugees or receiving subsidiary protection - for up to seven months, with no procedural rights."
"Is this humane?"
"The asylum package has been stalled for too long, and the common asylum system does not exist, Mr Weber."
"Nor do all the Member States have the same procedures."
"There is a lack of solidarity, which is the cause of the situation that we are experiencing."
"The Afghan citizen was compensated for non-material damage, not based on the Dublin regulation, but how much compensation can be applied for due to non-material damage by those fleeing wars who spend years going back and forth between camps?"
"We are tired of talking about abuse and traffickers."
"Will it not be the case that we want to look the other way and deny the existence of a situation that we seek to deny time and time again?"
"Dublin can indeed be perfected, but a great deal more needs to be done."
"This is urgent, Commissioner."
"(MT) Mr President, the European Court decision is not so much a condemnation against Belgium or Greece as it is as condemnation against the Dublin regulation, because it was that very Dublin regulation that allowed Belgium to transfer an Afghan person back to Greece."
"This is not fair."
"It is not fair that the border countries shoulder the burden single-handedly, because - let us be frank - the border countries are not there to act as police officers or border guards for the rest of the European Union countries."
"Therefore, in the wake of the decision handed down by the European Court of Justice, it is now clear that when a European country transfers an asylum seeker back to another European country that is under enormous pressure, it goes against the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have already begun to recognise this and have suspended the transfers."
"However, what we need is for the Dublin regulation to be amended without delay."
"(EL) Mr President, the reason I feel the need to speak at today's sitting is because the question of Cyprus and the immigration problem we face has not been raised."
"Cyprus, a small state with a population of half a million, has a daily influx of immigrants, who cross the Green line from the occupied areas in numbers of 30 to 50 a day, out of a population of half a million."
"We have no detention centres for asylum seekers."
"As a result, if their application is rejected, we cannot send them back at the end of the day to the country they came from."
"They enter via the occupied areas, most destroy their papers and basically, these immigrants stay on the island."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem."
"A proposal was made to erect a wall, which is why I have chosen to speak."
"Anyone who says something of this kind has completely failed to understand European values."
"For us, this is all about protecting fundamental rights and human rights."
"We cannot say about people who have fled from their country and sought asylum in Europe, for whatever reason, and about people who have voluntarily climbed into an overcrowded boat and put their lives at risk: 'We want to send these people back before they have even arrived'."
"We need sensible asylum processes for these people which function properly."
"We cannot leave the southern European countries, where these people arrive, to cope with the problem alone."
"I agree completely with my colleague, Mrs Hirsch, on that point."
"From another perspective, it is wrong to say that we want all these people to stay outside Europe and we do not want to take them in."
"Demographic change is taking place in Europe and in future, we will need integration and also asylum seekers who want to stay here."
"This is not just an issue of humanity, but also of common sense."
"For this reason, we need to come up with solutions to this problem quickly."
"(DE) Mr President, according to the judgment passed by the European Court of Human Rights, the asylum system in Greece is inhumane."
"This is because it can take up to five years to come to a final decision."
"However, the procedures all over Europe take a long time, because lies are being told, papers are being burnt or forged, decisions are ignored and the asylum system is quite simply being exploited and abused."
"This is particularly true where there is no real reason for asylum and, after a process lasting years, the applicant suddenly claims the right of residence on humanitarian grounds."
"In the light of the failed EU asylum system, we must finally be honest and admit that the EU cannot accept economic migrants from all over the world, particularly when, at the same time, it is spending billions of euro on development aid and support for democracy in the countries where these people come from."
"We finally need a clear definition of the right to asylum, which is closely linked to the Geneva Convention, in order to bring an end to economic migration."
"It must also include an obligation on the part of the asylum seekers to cooperate in the procedure."
"This will remove the legal basis for deception on humanitarian grounds."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the progressive waiving of visas, on the one hand, and the fresh upsurge in migratory flows, on the other, mean that the asylum package really needs to take priority in the Council."
"If supported by the Commission, this initiative would have the positive effect of regulating a complex issue and laying down a unitary strategy that enforces the decision we are negotiating today, as well as providing the opportunity to avoid transfers like those we have discussed today."
"Obviously, we are in favour of protecting human rights, though also marrying this requirement with a rigorous verification of requirements."
"Commissioner, since the situation has become unsustainable, we now need to begin the search for a positive set of rules and a clear regulatory framework."
"This is an important step which I am sure, with your help, can be sent for Council assessment within a reasonably short period of time."
"(FR) Mr President, my question will be very short, as the debate has been very dense and I have the feeling that, apart from certain extreme elements, we share the same concern."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner how she intends to counter the iconoclastic idea of erecting a wall between Turkey and Greece, even if this can be explained by the very strong pressure faced by this country, and even if, as some fellow Members have said, the conditions are particularly difficult for those who end up in detention centres."
"Even though the Member States are free to make their own construction plans - even if this means constructing a wall, even if it is an unrealistic solution - we Europeans are particularly implicated, both cyclically, with what is happening on the island of Lampedusa and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, and structurally, with the situation of the countries in the South."
"The time has therefore come to revisit the Dublin regulation urgently, so that we can take joint responsibility for these situations throughout Europe, showing solidarity and a humanistic approach."
"We will only be able to do this by constructing a genuine European asylum law, something which is becoming more urgent than ever."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the values on which the European Union is founded - human rights and fundamental rights - cannot be put up for debate."
"A judgment of the European Court requires urgent consideration and fast, effective action."
"This judgment requires the development, definition and implementation of a unitary strategy and common commitment."
"Asylum procedures must be dealt with immediately and in the best possible way."
"However, Europe cannot abandon those border countries that find themselves managing emergency migrations which do not only affect them but also, by extension, the whole of Europe."
"The border countries alone cannot bear all the responsibilities of the costs and organisation required to deal with asylum applications that often require a great deal of time and long and careful evaluations."
"These timeframes and careful evaluations must not affect the dignity of the migrants, which must always be protected in any case."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have contributed."
"This ruling is extremely interesting, but it does not completely undermine the Dublin system as it is today."
"This more or less works and, independent of the ruling, already obliges Member States to ensure that fundamental rights are respected."
"Nevertheless, it points out some important issues and that is why we do need to reform the Dublin Convention and we need to improve it."
"That is why the Commission has proposed improvements, and I am very happy to know that you are working on these and that you are also seeing the need to have some sort of emergency mechanism in this."
"We support you fully in that regard."
"We also need to accelerate our work to establish a common asylum system."
"Most people here are agreed with that, and I am very grateful for the work you are doing."
"The best way to achieve that is to go on with the work, to publish the reports and to encourage the Council to start negotiating."
"There are too many differences between the Member States today and that is not sustainable."
"In a common Union, with common values and a common application of international standards and conventions, there cannot be such differences as there are today."
"People need to be treated in a decent way."
"We need to ensure protection for the most vulnerable."
"We need to have efficient systems so that people are not kept in detention for months, and sometimes years."
"That is very painful for the individual and it is also very costly for society."
"We need to improve that. Again, I can only encourage you and the Council to keep on working on this."
"On Greece, the Commission is doing a lot to help."
"The Greek Government is working with its action plan."
"It is a very ambitious plan, but it has been clear from the beginning that this is not going to be solved over a weekend."
"There are long-standing problems."
"We are there to support and the fact that all Member States are involved in the Frontex operation, but have also offered different kinds of assistance - economic assistance or technical expertise, interpreters, administrative assistance - shows that there is true European solidarity."
"We need to help Greece because Greece is under extreme pressure, and that is a European challenge as well."
"Of course, Greece has the main responsibility."
"It has done a lot, but needs to do more."
"I am not convinced that a fence or a wall is a solution because there are other reforms that are much more important."
"We are also working with EASO, the new asylum support office in Valletta. And we are working with UNHCR."
"Lately, Turkey has shown itself to be constructive and cooperative."
"We have finalised the negotiations on a readmission agreement after eight years."
"I hope that the Member States will accept that when we have the next Council next week."
"On the figures that Mrs Wikström asked about, the figures I have for the period 2009 and 2010 show that there were 16 328 requests to take charge or take back migrants addressed by Member States to Greece."
"Of that number, 12 638 (77%) were accepted."
"Nevertheless, Member States executed only 2 251 of these transfers, that is a bit less than 14%."
"I would like to thank you again for the support you are giving to the work we are trying to do with the asylum package."
"The legislative acts are on the table."
"Let us keep on working together - the Commission, Parliament and the Council - to get this done as soon as possible so that, finally, we have a common European asylum system."
"The debate is closed."
"Immediate EU measures in support of Italy and other Member States affected by exceptional migratory flows (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the immediate EU measures in support of Italy and other Member States affected by exceptional migratory flows."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this very timely debate on a situation that deserves all our attention."
"The Commission is following the situation very closely and Frontex has sent two experts to the scene."
"Approximately 5 500 Tunisian migrants are reported to have reached Italian shores in the last couple of days, but the numbers have dropped a little bit in the last 24 hours."
"Those arriving are mostly men in their thirties, but there are also 34 women and 108 children; 27 facilitators of trafficking were identified."
"These people arriving on Italian shores are causing exceptional pressure on the reception facilities of Italy, particularly in Lampedusa."
"Last Saturday, we already started to have contact with the Italian Ministry of the Interior and we have also received a formal request for EU assistance."
"We are ready to assist both Italy and Tunisia."
"This is a matter of importance for the whole EU, not just a bilateral issue."
"Even before the last developments, the Commission, together with Frontex, started to identify what can be done in the short and medium term."
"The EU common response should be based on the principle of EU solidarity between Member States; and we are ready to assist Italy."
"But our approach should also be based on solidarity with Tunisia and its democratic transition."
"This was also expressed by Lady Ashton when she visited the Tunisian authorities in Tunis yesterday, offering them political and financial support."
"To assist Italy in these circumstances, we have identified a comprehensive series of concrete measures as well as quick financial assistance."
"Financially, we are ready to mobilise extraordinary assistance, under the European Refugee Fund for 2011, in addition to the funding already earmarked for Italy."
"This should cover payments for accommodation, infrastructure, material aid, medical care, social assistants, counselling with judicial administrative asylum procedures, legal aid, language assistance, etc."
"We can also mobilise quite quickly resources from EU funds such as the External Borders Fund and, if necessary, Italy can ask the new European Office for Asylum in Valetta to deploy teams of support to the national authorities dealing with the asylum requests."
"Concerning the surveillance of external borders, a joint Frontex operation could be set up and I am in contact with Frontex."
"I know preparations at technical level are being made."
"As usual, such a joint debate will depend on Member States' voluntary contributions of equipment."
"I invite all Member States to show their support."
"But let me reassure you on one point, referring to the debate we had just a few minutes ago: due to the different nature of sea/land border operations and a request to Member States to participate in a new joint operation, this will not compete with their contribution to the operation that we now have at the Greek land border."
"This is, of course, also a priority."
"I would like to underline that we must pay specific attention to vulnerable categories of persons in need of international protection."
"Their needs must be taken into account and they must be able to access the special protection that they are entitled to, as provided by national and EU law."
"With these concrete actions I have now mentioned, we are ready to meet and to engage with representatives of the Italian authorities to agree on details of each of these actions and the next steps."
"Of course, a medium-term strategy must also be further developed."
"In the particular context of migration flows, we need a combination of effective border management and a strategy for supporting democratic and economic transition."
"In the short term, the Tunisian authorities should efficiently patrol the frontiers of their own country, at sea and along the coasts, to prevent smugglers, human traffickers and criminals who have escaped from prison from taking advantage of the situation."
"It is also important that Tunisia takes back those who have reached the territory of EU Member States and are not in need of international protection."
"Looking at a more structured intervention, we should also explore the possibilities of better targeting EU assistance by promoting projects that are able to support income- and job-generating activities in the different regions of Tunisia, and I refer particularly to the southern parts of the country."
"More broadly, a coherent approach supporting political and economic development in Tunisia needs to include possibilities for these people to come to the EU legally, as well as the exchange of goods, services and know-how."
"There is a wind blowing over the Mediterranean as a result of these popular revolutions."
"This wind can bring many positive developments to Tunisia, to other countries, and to the EU."
"The current situation in Lampedusa should not undermine our intention to offer assistance and support to these emerging democracies and the young generation that so passionately and peacefully has been able to achieve fundamental political changes."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the humanitarian emergency in Italy and, in particular, on the island of Lampedusa - because this is what it is, a humanitarian emergency - compels us to act urgently."
"I propose five steps."
"Firstly, a veritable Marshall Plan for Tunisia and Egypt which would provide tangible help across the board but, at the same time, expect in return the full cooperation of the Tunisian authorities in blocking their coasts so as not to allow further illegal emigration by sea."
"Secondly, we need the urgent deployment of a Frontex RABIT mission - a rapid border intervention team."
"So, Commissioner, we do not just need two Frontex experts but a Frontex mission that must be sent there now."
"Thirdly, we need to give Italy tangible help with the reception of the thousands of people who have landed in Lampedusa."
"Quite frankly, Commissioner, I do not see how you can say that EASO will send its experts when this EU office is still not yet operating, so we will have to do it in another manner."
"Fourthly, we need to help with the process of repatriation: immediate repatriation of people who do not qualify for asylum protection."
"They should be sent back to Tunisia where they came from."
"Finally, we need to bear in mind that in the Treaty, we have Article 80, which clearly states that our immigration policy should be based on the principle of solidarity and on the just sharing of responsibility."
"I think that it is about time that the Commission implemented this article."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that there is a large majority of Members of this House that welcome the democratic movements in Mediterranean countries as a challenge to European external policy and to its commitment to values, but also that there are many of us who know that these movements are not harmless."
"They have humanitarian effects and an impact in terms of migratory pressure on neighbouring countries."
"This is therefore the time to be reminded that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force, and Articles 67, 77, 78(3) and 80, as has just been said, state that shared solidarity and responsibility make this challenge a European one."
"It is not only a shared challenge but a joint one, and therefore one that affects the European institutions."
"It is time to say that no country is alone."
"It is time to say that this is not an issue for Italy in Lampedusa, or for Malta, Greece or Spain."
"No!"
"It is an issue for the European institutions."
"It is also the time, however, to say that we are not talking about the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders, which is an operational agency, or about the European Asylum Support Office, but about the level of political decision making."
"This means pointing out that the necessary resources need to be invested in development cooperation and assisting with the needs of these countries in terms of establishing and consolidating democracy."
"The necessary resources also need to be invested, however, in assisting EU Member States with the challenge of primary care in response to immigration and with the challenge of managing the joint borders."
"This is therefore the time to say that the Treaty of Lisbon has a whole programme to implement and that Parliament will be there to support it in tackling the challenge that we have before us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start my speech with a statement supposedly made by the Italian Foreign Minister yesterday in Damascus, during which he said - listen to this - that Syria 'is a stable country in which the population's desire for modernisation has been satisfied'."
"Meanwhile, a few days ago, Italy's Interior Minister made another statement in which he shifted his responsibilities to Europe, which has allegedly abandoned Italy 'as usual', he added with a hint of mischief."
"As usual, however, we are witnessing the habit of blaming Europe when it suits, only to ignore it irritably when Brussels disapproves of the agreement on sea repatriations, which violates humanitarian law and lines the pockets of African dictators - some of whom are today being toppled - and continuing even today to lavish billions on the Libya of Mr Gaddafi, or refusing EUR 10 million of aid offered to the Italian Government by the European Fund for Refugees, which Italy decided not to use, possibly because it would have to be spent in keeping with Europe's transparent rules and not the in-house criteria of the Italian Civil Protection Agency."
"Therefore, I think that we will achieve nothing by acting like this and by making these declarations."
"The lesson of recent weeks has really not been learnt."
"Lampedusa reminds us that history is stronger than certain political games and recourse to declarations that create illusions."
"It reminds us that not everything can be bought with money, that Europe is not something that can be called upon when it suits, but is a project that must be committed to each day, demanding rights and solidarity but also respecting the commitments undertaken."
"In order to slow down migration in a sustainable and purposeful way, five things are needed: democracy, development, respect for international law, European solidarity and also, above all, no prejudicial rhetoric."
"Mr President, by restricting the title of this debate to support for Italy and other Member States, we are once again making the mistake of focusing only on the problems of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean."
"What we are lacking is concern for those people who are fleeing across the sea."
"If we really take our principles concerning the protection of refugees seriously, we must first make sure and, if necessary, check in individual cases what situation these people are in and then guarantee that their human rights will be protected."
"We must not allow people to be turned away and our borders to be fortified."
"The help which the EU border agency Frontex can offer in this situation is constantly referred to."
"It is true that it could be helpful if it would focus its activities on protecting and rescuing refugees."
"We must not turn away boats full of refugees as we have done in the past."
"Here in Parliament, we are currently drawing up a new mandate for Frontex and I hope that we will succeed in introducing improvements, including more transparency and specific requirements for the agency to act in accordance with human rights."
"Of course, we also need to help Tunisia quickly to structure its economy in such a way that the people there become more confident of having a chance of earning a decent living in their own country."
"We must make it possible for Tunisia to achieve rapid and positive economic development by means of trade with the EU and subsidies for projects there."
"This is one of the main requirements of the democratic transformation of Tunisia."
"It is completely incomprehensible that once again, many Member States of the EU are leaving the countries bordering on the Mediterranean to cope with an unforeseen influx of refugees."
"The call for voluntary action to help islands such as Lampedusa and Malta has fallen on deaf ears."
"We must find a binding solution which requires states in the centre and the north of the EU to take in refugees."
"The infrastructure is in place."
"All that is lacking is the political will and the sense of solidarity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot, in truth, discuss the problem of Lampedusa without keeping one thing in mind: in Tunisia, under President Ben Ali, there was a law, which has still not been repealed, which made emigration a crime."
"This means that it is not just an issue for Frontex because, after all, it is necessary to guarantee that these people will not be returned only to end up in a Tunisian prison, and it is necessary to persuade the new government to repeal this law."
"However, above all, I believe that this reveals a fundamental unreality in our immigration policy, which is dependent on one person. This person is not Mrs Malmström, nor is it Mr Barroso; it is Mr Gaddafi."
"If Mr Gaddafi falls, as I sincerely hope he does, what will we do about our principal buffer for immigrants from North and sub-Saharan Africa?"
"Furthermore, this shows us that we have, at the moment, from Morocco to Syria, a 5 000 kilometre line along which the humanitarian risk has increased at every kilometre of the way, and that we have to prepare ourselves in a way which is perhaps without parallel in European history since 1956 in Hungary, for a refugee crisis."
"This implies an end to codecision with regard to resettlement because we could have refugee camps on Europe's borders if one of these revolutions goes badly - something which we hope will not happen - and put an end once and for all to the edifice of the policies on asylum in Europe and on shared relocation of asylum seekers within the countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies."
"The urgent interventions requested by Italy are: 1) the transformation of Frontex from a coordination agency to an operative structure with its own people and resources; 2) the implementation of the principle of burden sharing; 3) the use of Europol for investigations on possible terrorist infiltrations and criminal organisation of the traffic in human beings; and 4) the allocation of resources to deal with the emergency."
"In any case, none of this will resolve the structural causes of the revolutions in the Maghreb, which all arise from the lack of genuine political parties, trade unions, associations, a free press and, above all, lack of respect for human rights."
"In essence, the institutional tools that characterise true democracy and give the people a voice are missing."
"Without them, there cannot be economic development, jobs, stability and security for all."
"This is the real political challenge that Europe must face up to."
"(NL) Mr President, we have a real emergency in Europe."
"At the moment, Europe is being flooded by a tsunami of Islamic immigrants from Barbary, North Africa."
"Tens of thousands of fortune seekers, some of whom are hardened criminals or even terrorists, have already arrived in Lampedusa and there are hundreds of thousands who are on the verge of following suit."
"The European border appears to be as leaky as a sieve."
"Italy is failing to protect our external border and Frontex is being overtaken by events."
"I would therefore call on the Council and the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to convene an emergency meeting, in accordance with Article 28(2), at which the Council should take tough measures to call a halt to this immigration wave."
"I would also advise Prime Minister Berlusconi not to ask us for money to help tidy up his mess and his rubbish or help keep immigrants out of his country."
"Instead, he should spend a bit less time skirt-chasing and get to work sending all these immigrants back to Africa."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her efforts and for the efforts she will continue to make in dealing with this humanitarian emergency."
"However, Commissioner, you know as well as I do that the real emergency is not the humanitarian one - which is only an after-effect - but the fact that, during this historic uprising across the whole of the Maghreb, Europe has appeared inadequate, which is to say, it has been unable to redevelop a strategy for the Mediterranean, as it has tried to several times and always failed."
"The Lisbon Process has failed and the Union for the Mediterranean has failed miserably."
"We do not have a proper view of the real problems at issue here."
"We need to confront them together, but today the Council is not here."
"We asked the Council to look at the issue of having a European strategy to deal not so much with the problem of immigration and illegal immigration, but rather the question of democracy and freedom across the whole Mediterranean area."
"When the Soviet Bloc collapsed, presenting a united front, we all gave practical answers and easily dealt with the problem of the thousands of Poles who arrived on our streets, because we looked at the problem of integrating the whole of the East into Europe."
"Regarding the Mediterranean, today we have nothing to say."
"Instead, we must equip ourselves with a strategy, without which we will not be able to provide any answers."
"We shall appreciate your good intentions and stop there."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(PT) Mr President, please note, I can argue with you why it is that Europe has not had a response to its immigration problems."
"I would say, principally, that it is because it has been looking for a policing response to a problem which is social, economic and political."
"However, the question I wish to ask you relates to the question that was asked by my colleague, Mr Tavares."
"Is it acceptable, in your opinion, that Frontex or other operational methods can repatriate Tunisians when the laws of Tunisia still state that people who are repatriated will go to prison?"
"Alternatively, in the first place, is it necessary to guarantee some kind of diplomatic action to ensure that this law becomes null and void, in order that we may subsequently talk about other types of instruments such as those which I have just mentioned?"
"(IT) Mr President, thank you for the question."
"I would point out that, just a few days ago, when I was on a mission to Tunisia with Mr Panzeri, the Chair of the Delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries, we noted that the provisional government is introducing profound changes to the legal system and to the laws governing this subject as a whole."
"Based on the relations of trust between Europe and the new panorama taking shape in Tunisia, I believe we can take the first steps towards solving the problems that you put forward."
"(FR) Yes, it was the last speaker but two."
"I wanted to ask my fellow Member how he acquired the belief that the people in Lampedusa are Islamists and delinquents, and whether he possesses any personal information allowing him to confirm this or whether it is, in fact, the result of his own fantasies."
"(NL) Mr President, surely it is common knowledge that the people from Libya who are arriving there are, for the most part, Islamic people, and that there are quite a few criminals, and even terrorists, amongst them?"
"I assume that everyone here is aware of that, and if you were not aware of that, then you must be incredibly naïve."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to have this debate with the Commission on the North African migration crisis."
"We have seen these people arrive in Lampedusa only to find no facilities able to receive and identify them."
"In fact, the Italian Government dismantled the existing reception centre and reduced the facilities there some time ago, under the banner of 'Zero immigration', thus preventing Italy from being able to tackle illegal immigration."
"We know that this problem concerns Italy, but it also concerns Europe."
"Considerable financial investment is needed to solve it within a coordinated policy framework, while complying with international treaties and ensuring that refugees are protected."
"In your response, Commissioner, I would like to know precisely when the Italian Government asked the European Commission to intervene, because there have been certain controversies, of which you are well aware."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over 5 000 immigrants have arrived in Italy in the last few hours, while another 100 000 are setting out for Italy, France and Germany."
"The Tunisian Minister for Justice has confirmed that some 11 000 prisoners, terrorists and criminals are hiding amongst the illegal immigrants."
"I submitted an urgent question to the Commission in advance so as to obtain an answer from Baroness Ashton - who, inexplicably, is not here today - and the Commission only agreed to pass it on today, and only because it was forced into a corner yesterday by Parliament."
"This deafening silence is the most obvious sign of the lack of fibre shown by this Europe and its government, which is even afraid of taking a stand when faced with a humanitarian crisis that is raising serious humanitarian and security problems."
"Half an hour, ladies and gentlemen, is all the time allowed for this democratic institution to debate an historic upheaval and its consequences for the people of Europe."
"What should I tell my constituents who are afraid?"
"What will the European Union do tomorrow - and I mean tomorrow! - to deal with this terrible situation?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a remote island lost in the middle of the Mediterranean by the name of Lampedusa."
"Back in 2008, this island made the headlines because 40 000 refugees landed there in that year."
"The problem was later resolved by an agreement - the so-called 'friendship treaty' - signed by the Italian and Libyan governments."
"Now we are facing the same situation again, but it is far more complicated this time, Mrs Malmström."
"Peace, stability and new governments in Tunisia as well as in Egypt are the driving forces behind a storm that is whipping up the Mediterranean."
"I am Sicilian and, unlike many Members who have spoken, I visited the former identification and expulsion centre."
"That centre was useful at the time but, once the friendship treaty was concluded, it no longer had any reason to exist."
"What can the Commission do, and what can Frontex do?"
"Of course, we would all like to see the rapid intervention mission deployed in practice."
"We want Frontex to be a flexible, streamlined, well-structured agency with its own financial resources, and Mr Busuttil and I are reviewing its mandate in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"In addition, Mr Mauro has asked the Council to act immediately and include the issue on its agenda without further delay, since it is an absolute priority, given that immigrants have also started arriving from Egypt now."
"There is a real risk that the dignity and decorum of many refugees may suffer with the inevitable delays, although we are certain that Mrs Malmström will once again make sure her words are well received."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current flood of migrants is a serious problem, and it is a European one."
"What is needed is not complaints, however, but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far-sighted manner."
"We must take action at two levels, and we will need broad shoulders to bear our responsibilities."
"The first level concerns the immediate situation."
"Additional funds must be made available to deal with the crisis; we need at last to prepare a European round table, putting on the agenda the possibility of sharing out the immigrants fairly among the various countries; and, lastly, we have to meet with the provisional Tunisian Government to demand that resources and instruments be put in place to stem the current exodus."
"The second level is more strictly political in nature."
"It is absolutely vital to radically review our neighbourhood policies."
"Action is needed based on a renewed policy of economic, financial and social cooperation, an intelligent immigration policy, and effective support for the economic reforms and the democratic transition process under way in Tunisia."
"It is only by taking such action that we will be able to tackle and solve the problems now facing Italy and Europe."
"Commissioner, I am sure you will agree with us all that it really is time now to stop talking and start acting."
"(ES) Mr President, while not wishing to take the comparison between terrorism and immigration too far, I have observed that unfortunately, EU action is driven by emergency situations, such as a serious attack or a mass landing of immigrants, as is currently happening in Lampedusa, where the exodus of Tunisians to the Italian coast could culminate in a chronicle of a death foretold."
"The voyage of hope could end up becoming a cursed voyage, and it will be on the consciences of all of us who witness these continuous uncontrolled influxes and do not say 'enough is enough' with sufficient authority."
"When it happens, we will throw up our hands in horror, but the following day we will forget about it."
"Europeans have a duty and a right to know the truth: that the Mediterranean strategy is not working, that the common immigration policy will continue to be a dream until European countries commit to equipping the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) with sufficient resources to be effective."
"Talking does not cost anything, but we need to act."
"Do you really believe that Frontex is currently able to guarantee the security of the European borders?"
"I do not believe it is."
"Let us hope that the people of Egypt, Tunisia and other countries of the Maghreb do not decide en masse to seek a better future in Europe, but rather that they do so in their own countries, because that is what they have fought for, and we must help them."
"Solidarity and responsibility are therefore required, along with, above all, truth when talking about a common European immigration policy, which is now more necessary than ever."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has long been like the Sleeping Beauty on matters of immigration, and we are now paying the price for the time wasted."
"The fact is that immigration is still not a priority for the European Union or for all 27 Member States, but the burden is often left for the border countries to bear alone."
"Developing a suitable Euro-Mediterranean strategy should also be a common goal, but in this case too, we have to admit that the Barcelona Process has, in fact, never taken off."
"The fact is, Commissioner, that these are uncomfortable subjects."
"Some Member States, such as Italy, Greece, Malta and so on, quite rightly have to deal with them and have a duty of solidarity, whereas most Member States stand on the sidelines as passive onlookers and confine themselves to just lecturing the others."
"There is a great deal to do, then, on the legislative front in terms of funds and strengthening of instruments - I am referring to Frontex - but what is needed most of all is political will."
"To conclude, Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström and the entire Commission for precisely that: for assuring the Italian Government of its commitment - repeated again today - to tackle the humanitarian crisis in Lampedusa."
"Mr President, the rapid developments in North Africa and the Middle East have shaken, I hope, our dolce far niente type of confidence that Europe is so prosperous and secure that it does not have to fear any major security challenge."
"Only this time, time has the bad habit of not stopping, and what appears impossible today suddenly becomes a reality tomorrow."
"The problem we are discussing is both technical and political."
"Let me refer to the letter, which says that now, with the increasing numbers of refugees from North Africa in the wake of the current revolutionary developments there, the EU is caught between its public support for them and the quiet necessity to keep its gates closed."
"All I want to say is that if we want to remain credible, the solution to our technical problem, which goes beyond money and police, should be consistent with our public pronouncements."
"Therefore, harsh measures of the type some Members have recently taken against people from other EU Member States, if adopted, will only discredit the EU - this time not only internally, but also externally."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so immediately willing and far-sighted in offering Italy assistance, although the assistance was rejected in the first instance by the Italian Government itself."
"Commissioner, you have rightly stressed the need to support Tunisia at this time of democratic transition."
"However, I wonder, and I ask you all: what has happened to the money that Europe has been pouring into Tunisia all these years and which it is still pouring into Libya, which - as we know - are democratic regimes?"
"Therefore, it is now wonderful and amazing to cheer this awakening of the Tunisian people, although I wonder how on earth all that money was ever granted."
"If the Libyans woke up tomorrow, what conclusion would we draw from that?"
"Would we have thought yet again that we had been funding democratic regimes, only to realise the next day that we had been implementing a disastrous policy instead?"
"I ask myself, Commissioner, how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening, while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect."
"I would like to pick up on what Mr Portas and Mr Tavares said."
"They pointed out, extraordinarily, that in countries like Tunisia, emigration is viewed as a crime."
"To begin with, regarding all the people who have landed on Lampedusa - and I would remind Mr Madlener that they are not Libyans but Tunisians, although that is hardly important because Libyans will soon be arriving as well - who will decide whether they are refugees or not, given that a situation of extreme confusion reigns in Tunisia at the moment?"
"Above all, however, how will we feel if we repatriate these people, in the knowledge that they will be thrown into prison as soon as they arrive?"
"These, then, are the points that I believe we should be thinking about, and, above all, we should realise that racist policies like those implemented by the Italian Government have unfortunately produced only highly negative results."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are grateful to the Commissioner for the commitments that have been made, although it should be said that with all the salaries the European Union pays around the world - with 136 diplomatic missions - it could perhaps have realised what was happening sooner."
"In fact, the situation was not even foreseen by the representatives of the Socialist International, one of whose members was the nice Tunisian dictator, whose brilliant social and political management of that country led to all this."
"We want to learn from the Commission why it does not talk to us clearly about sharing out these people among the various European countries."
"It is not fair - as the coastal states have been saying for a long time - that this problem should only affect the countries that have a Mediterranean sea border with North African countries."
"That is a fundamental point, and it is also fundamental to remember that Frontex has very limited resources: I have heard that two experts have been sent."
"There is a massive crisis taking place in Lampedusa, not least in humanitarian terms, which needs to be tackled with a task force of appropriate size in order to remedy the mistakes and failures of the recent past."
"The situation is extremely serious and it may also get worse from a public health point of view, since water has perhaps already begun to run out in Lampedusa."
"I am going to be strict with the times, not least because Mrs Malmström has to leave Parliament at 18:00."
"We must therefore allow her to reply to your questions, which will otherwise remain unanswered."
"(MT) Mr President, indeed, we have been talking about this tragedy that has been taking place in the Mediterranean for years, and I am afraid to say, you have taken no heed."
"You have ignored it because, as has been said by others before me, it is a false solidarity that is talked about when it comes to irregular immigration to Europe."
"At the moment, this tragedy can be witnessed in Lampedusa; and it is a grave tragedy."
"Now, when Lampedusa becomes overcrowded - which it already is - everyone will be sent to Italy and at least the situation will be more bearable."
"God forbid, Commissioner, had the same number entered Malta, because the tragedy would have been far greater."
"Whoever comes to Malta will have no choice but to remain."
"Yet, Malta cannot extend any further."
"Nor can the funds be used to turn tiny Malta into a huge prison that will detain all these people on the island."
"This is why we need true commitment from the Member States, and more solidarity, particularly from the Northern European countries, because, as the Vice-President of this Parliament mentioned, we are witnessing none of this solidarity on the part of other European Union Member States."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for having devoted her attention to the issue of Tunisia."
"To be sincere, I would have liked this debate to be given a different title, namely 'Debate in support of Tunisia and other countries fighting against dictatorships and for human rights'."
"Instead, we are making a humanitarian crisis out of the fact that one of the greatest world powers, Italy, is having to tackle the problem of taking in 5 000 people."
"Of course, for Lampedusa, these refugees are a problem, even though a daily ferry links the island to Sicily and there is also an airport through which these people can be taken away."
"We have to realise that what is being discussed at the moment is not the problem of Frontex or how to stop the boats, but the fact that we are dealing with peoples whom we have urged to fight for democracy and, now that they are doing so, we must be in a position to receive them."
"Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries."
"(DE) Mr President, the last huge influx of refugees, similar to what we are now seeing as a result of the Tunisian revolution, was probably in 1989 following the collapse of communism."
"The EU has learnt nothing from its past experience."
"It was taken completely by surprise by the stream of refugees."
"Now, with the arrival of all those people who do not want to roll up their sleeves and rebuild their own country, Italy is being called on not to send back the Tunisian economic migrants."
"However, that is exactly the problem."
"As long as these people are not returned to their home country immediately, without repatriation aid, we will constantly be overwhelmed by waves of economic migrants."
"Tens of thousands of them are already waiting in the neighbouring countries."
"Mass amnesties and generous offers to overlook the fact that the majority of them are merely economic migrants have simply led, in the past, to a new influx of asylum seekers."
"If we introduce quotas for asylum procedures, instead of sending the migrants back immediately, we are just creating incentives for similar behaviour in the future."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer the Commissioner my heartfelt thanks for this debate, for what she has told us, for having honoured us with her presence, and for the commitments she has made, which show the extent to which mutual understanding between Europe and Italy can help my country deal with this crisis."
"I would like to take up something she said: 'There is a wind blowing over the Mediterranean'."
"It is true, Mr President: it is a wind of freedom and democracy that is having immediate effects which Italy finds it is having to manage."
"When the wind blows harder, some people put up walls and others build windmills."
"Let me tell you, Commissioner, that the south of Italy, Puglia, where Mr Baldassarre, Mr Mauro and I come from, has been building windmills for decades; that is to say, it has been developing forms of reception and working hard to guarantee immigrants their dignity and to provide them with a fair and decent reception."
"We cannot do it all alone, however."
"It would be wonderful, Commissioner, if these windmills that we have been building for years could also see the mark of an attentive and effective Europe that joins us in building them."
"(NL) Mr President, it seems rather ironic that, just as the first signs of freedom and democracy have begun to emerge in Tunisia, a wave of refugees has been unleashed."
"It seems a little hard to believe that they would actually want to leave this country."
"Major changes seem to be taking place throughout the Middle East and it may well be that this is just a precursor of things to come."
"Therefore, I think that it is a positive thing that the Commission is taking all possible steps to prepare itself."
"The Commission should now also prove that it can get the situation under control."
"All community stops need to be pulled out, we will have to come to Tunisia's aid, but it seems inevitable to me that, in these particular circumstances, just as we are seeing the first signs of freedom in Tunisia, many of these people will turn out not to be genuine refugees."
"For that reason, it is just as inevitable that the Commission should aim to send a large number of people back to Tunisia, precisely in order to set an example for the future, given that it is possible that more refugees from Middle Eastern countries will follow."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the exceptional flow of immigrants besetting the Italian coast and, hence, the whole of Europe, must spur us on to developing a common approach at last for managing this phenomenon."
"In this respect, the ongoing talks between the Italian authorities and the Commission are well on the way to providing a response to the humanitarian crisis that we have been discussing."
"With all due respect to Mr Crocetta, I have to point out that the problem is not so much the 5 000 people who have arrived so far but the potentially momentous scale of the upheavals and the many thousand more refugees who could arrive on our shores if we send out clear political messages."
"We need to address this with the utmost urgency."
"The crisis must be overcome, but then a structural response will be needed."
"We must enhance the role of Frontex to make it more operational and able to directly manage certain processes of identifying refugees, checking their country of origin and organising repatriations."
"We must enhance the role of Europol in order to prevent potential terrorists and criminals from slipping in."
"Above all, we must respond quickly."
"I think the Commission has reacted well, and I hope the Council, too, will do its part."
"(SL) Madam President, we are witnessing a new humanitarian tragedy on the European Union's doorstep."
"It may be Lampedusa today, but we can expect an even greater influx of immigrants from North African countries elsewhere."
"Even just from Egypt into Israel, there are some 600 immigrants said to be fleeing every month."
"The authorities are no longer able to control the situation."
"We need a rapid and joint response."
"We must not respond by closing doors and by equating immigrants with criminals."
"It would be a disgrace if anyone actually thought along those lines in Europe, where the freedom of movement is a fundamental right and a symbol of freedom and equality."
"We Member States have to bear joint responsibility and share the burden which has fallen on Italy today."
"We have to mobilise forces and financial resources because this is about human lives."
"Our response to the recent events in Tunisia and Egypt has been patchy and slow."
"Let us demonstrate our credibility now and let us not succumb to the anti-immigrant rhetoric of extreme right and xenophobic parties."
"It is Italy that needs concrete help today; tomorrow, it might be another country."
"We need a rapid response now."
"(NL) Madam President, very well, democratic developments may be afoot in North Africa, but they are also bringing with them obligations for Europe."
"The problems of North Africa cannot be resolved in southern Europe."
"On this point, I stand shoulder to shoulder with my Italian fellow Members."
"My question to the Commissioner is: is there any possibility of shortening the procedures, introducing fast-track examination of applications and sending anyone who is not a bona fide refugee back to Tunisia straightaway?"
"Because we are now seeing large groups of young men setting off for southern Italy."
"There are probably many economic refugees amongst them and we need to separate the genuine refugees from the economic refugees."
"In addition, there is, of course, the public relations problem."
"Many Europeans are under the impression that a horde of Tunisians are heading for southern Italy."
"That is a public relations problem: not just for Italy, but for the European Union, too."
"Hence, the key things are: faster procedures and better public relations."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Malmström, we were all pleased, as were the citizens of Europe, about the revolution in Egypt and Tunisia and the fact that values such as freedom and democracy were suddenly on the agenda."
"Images from these countries have dominated the news over the last few days."
"However, for two or three days, we have also been seeing pictures of the streams of refugees and people in boats on our television screens and in our newspapers."
"We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories."
"We must remember what these countries have really achieved."
"We must explain to the public that although a lot of people are coming here, the majority of them will go back, because they have no right to asylum as we define it."
"Of course, we have to ask ourselves the question which is frequently posed about economic migrants."
"One thing is clear."
"If these young people have no future prospects, they will come back."
"Perhaps not the same people, but constant streams of new migrants."
"This is why we need to deal with this problem now."
"(EL) Madam President, the Mediterranean is going up in flames."
"Obviously, immigration will increase."
"As civilised people, we need to treat all these people like human beings."
"However, we must not overlook the fact that most immigrants come from Muslim countries."
"According to the official report, Muslim populations are set to rise by 35%, from 1.6 billion to 2.2 billion, over the next twenty years."
"Europe today has just 2.7% of the Muslim population."
"With these influxes and this birth rate, this is expected to rise to 6% in twenty years."
"So, as you can see, an economic and social reversal in the functioning of Europe, in European culture, is on its way."
"We therefore need to look at the issue as Europe and not leave the Member States to address it on their own."
"Madam President, as the Commissioner said, the winds of change are blowing across North Africa; somewhat reminiscent of what happened in Eastern Europe twenty years ago."
"If the outcome is the same - the establishment of democratic regimes - then I think we should be very pleased."
"The downside, of course, is that in the short term at least, we have a refugee and asylum problem, particularly in Italy."
"As Italy is in the European Union it is a problem for Italy, it is a problem for Europe; the solution has to be Italian, the solution has to be European."
"We cannot close the door to refugees, but, at the same time, the door cannot be opened to all the refugees and asylum seekers in the world."
"So the solution really is, I think, in the multi-point plan suggested by my colleague, Mr Busuttil, particularly to ensure that repatriation takes place when it is proper and safe to do so and, of course, also to send back asylum seekers who are not deserving of that status within the European Union."
"We have to act in solidarity with Italy and we can do so."
"(SK) Madam President, I believe we are discussing a pan-European issue here."
"We have to understand that Europe must act in a spirit of solidarity and unity."
"Today, we have an issue with Italy and with refugees from Tunisia, but tomorrow it may be from Algeria, Egypt or possibly Libya, from whence thousands have already come to us in the past."
"The fact that we do not have the Council here is a problem, of course."
"The Council is not interested in this issue."
"I am disappointed that the Council is not sitting here today, listening to Parliament's debate with us."
"In my opinion, we must work with the Commission to find a solution that will be, on the one hand, legally proper, while, on the other, as my colleague, Mr Kelly, said, we cannot simply accept all refugees coming to Europe from North Africa."
"This is surely not our objective, and those who do not deserve political asylum must be returned to their country of origin."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, welcome to this sitting and thank you for coming."
"Today, the problem is in Lampedusa."
"Tomorrow, it will be in Malta and Crete."
"The day after, let us not kid ourselves, it will be in Milan and, shortly after that, it will be in Brussels or Paris."
"This problem is not a problem of our partner countries in the South; it is a European problem."
"We need solidarity."
"We also need to strengthen the means and measures at our disposal, including Frontex, Europol and maritime reconnaissance."
"However, it is also vital, eight years on, that we take a serious look at and, where necessary, revise Dublin II."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, if Mr Busuttil had listened to what I said in my introduction, he would have heard that I said almost everything that was in his speech, but I am happy to repeat it."
"We are ready to use the funds that we have at our disposal to assist the Italian authorities immediately."
"We are in dialogue with them to identify what kind of help they need."
"Italy has a lot of experience in dealing with different kinds of disasters but they perhaps need help with humanitarian aid for shelter, food and medicines, and they might also need help with screening, assistance and identification."
"We will put that help at their disposal and we are talking to them about this at the moment."
"This is a European responsibility and that is why we have to come up with European solutions."
"We have Frontex staff in place, but we are also examining the possibility - and we are ready - of setting up a Frontex operation within a very short time, but, of course, we need to discuss the modalities with Italy and also with the other countries that might possibly contribute."
"I am happy that Mr Busuttil is the rapporteur for Frontex so that in the future, we will have an even better functioning Frontex with amendments."
"If we had a Frontex operation in Tunisian waters, we would, of course, need to do this in cooperation with the Tunisian authorities."
"We are not there yet."
"We are also encouraging the Tunisian authorities to take back their nationals who are not in need of international protection."
"We are looking at the law in this respect, as raised by Mr Tavares and others."
"We hope that the new democratic government will not have such a law, but, of course, it has to be examined on a case by case basis and looked at carefully."
"We are also willing to support the Tunisian authorities with advice, support for border and police management, and also with training, equipment and funds."
"EASO is still not operational in Malta, but there is a board functioning and they have said that they can send national teams to Italy to help should they wish."
"We will also discuss it this next week at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the JHA Council that will meet next week."
"We are working with UNHCR in order to ask them to help in the identification of those in need of international protection and to help us to make analysis for the future."
"Frontex is also involved in doing analysis for the whole region."
"In Tunisia, there is, of course, as most of you have said, a very hopeful situation and we all support the democratic development there."
"Lady Ashton was there yesterday for discussions with the authorities."
"We are ready to offer election support to them in carrying out elections."
"We are discussing different ways to strengthen other kinds of support and to develop and strengthen their democratic development."
"Economic assistance can be provided."
"We are discussing different mobility programmes and we also need to increase the possibilities for people to come legally to Europe."
"There is also discussion about a donor conference."
"I agree with Mr Mauro and others who said that of course, we need to look at the whole region."
"I think many were quite surprised when the Berlin Wall fell."
"We did not have an action plan immediately up our sleeve."
"This situation is a little different but, of course, people asking for freedom and democracy is something that we in the European Union should support."
"We are reviewing the neighbourhood policy plan because events have made it necessary and we are looking at the whole region - in particular Egypt, but also the other countries - in order to maximise the different tools, funds and policies that we have at our disposal and to tailor them much more adequately to the recent developments in the region."
"I am sure we will come back to this debate because the issue is on the agenda and is likely to stay there, but I want to assure you once again that the Commission is following this very closely."
"We are ready to assist Italy, Tunisia and other countries affected by this."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Italian Government's appeal to the European Union is one of the prerogatives of membership."
"As many fellow Members have pointed out, the principles of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibilities, as laid down in the Treaties, must be applied in practice."
"The difficult situation that Italy is currently facing comes within Europe's jurisdiction, as Mrs Malmström suggested."
"The European institutions' slowness to react is not in step with the extremely rapid course of events in the countries of North Africa."
"Italy, and particularly the south of the country, is the first border point of Europe in the Mediterranean and it finds itself dealing with numbers of arrivals that can be imagined but not planned for."
"What we are experiencing shows how serious it is that we have abandoned the Barcelona Process."
"The European Union needs to rethink its strategy for the Mediterranean and to make that one of its main priorities again."
"The short-term response of financial aid and extraordinary intervention measures will help, but it will not be enough."
"The democratic transition processes spreading through the countries on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean need to be matched with medium- and long-term initiatives to deal with social and economic issues."
"The debate we are dealing with today is particularly important."
"In fact, over 4 000 refugees from nearby Tunisia have been recorded landing on the island of Lampedusa in the last four days alone."
"Thus, a public health crisis is developing on a scale never before recorded."
"It should also be borne in mind that the local council is tackling this crisis without the appropriate resources and facilities that the situation requires."
"Italy immediately turned to the European Union to request prompt action."
"However, while I vehemently support this request for help, I would stress that the commitment by Frontex - the European agency charged with tackling landings in the Mediterranean - is valuable but insufficient to deal with the landings of Tunisian illegal immigrants."
"During the February mini-session, I expressed my concerns about the deteriorating situations in the countries of North Africa and their resulting repercussions in Europe."
"I will emphasise it again here in this Chamber that the European Union needs to make a greater commitment to an effective common immigration policy that will enable the EU to manage illegal immigration and, above all, to come to the aid of those countries, such as Italy, that are more directly exposed to the flow of immigrants."
"The sudden arrival of thousands of migrants on the small Italian island of Lampedusa is an exceptional event."
"However, this event brings us face to face with a problem which concerns all Europeans."
"Right now, it is important that European solidarity should function properly."
"I agree with you, Commissioner, in your appeal to the Member States to deliver urgent aid to Italy, both in terms of goods and in terms of finance."
"Very often, in these situations, the countries in which migrants arrive are not their final destinations."
"Reception centres are frequently outdated, and serious tensions sometimes arise in areas where migrants are received."
"We have already passed some significant milestones in the fight against illegal immigration and in regulating flows."
"However, in a Union where internal borders have practically disappeared, Europe must equip itself in the long term with the means to achieve its ambitions."
"It must create a genuine immigration policy, open a constructive dialogue with countries of origin and strengthen the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (Frontex) in its missions."
"Adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems'."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, allow me to start this debate by thanking my colleagues for their extremely pleasant and fruitful cooperation."
"I would also like to extend those thanks to the advisors of the parliamentary secretariats and, of course, our own staff."
"It was not easy to manage such a large number of amendments."
"I still think that we have been successful, however, because we have now come up with something concrete in response to the Green Paper."
"A secure, sustainable and adequate pension, which is the guarantee that European citizens want."
"It is not as simple as that, however, as pensions are, and will remain, the responsibility of Member States."
"However, that does not mean that we are not allowed to express our opinions or table any proposals through the open coordination method, which may entail revision."
"The sustainability of pension systems is under threat, with an inverted population pyramid being the trend: we now have more older people, senior citizens are living longer and therefore, fewer people are left to finance the pensions."
"The pay-as-you-go systems of the first pillar are the perfect expression of the solidarity between the generations, and they will continue to remain the most important in the future, too."
"However, on top of the burden on the younger generation, there is undeniably also a pressure on collective budgets and that, in turn, is having repercussions on the Stability Pact, whether we like it or not."
"Member States are raising their retirement ages."
"I am rejecting the proposals for European indexation of pensions to increased life expectancy."
"I am doing that because of significant variations in life expectancy between Member States and because, even if we could index the two, this would not be socially responsible, in my opinion."
"What we have found, though, is that we must all move towards a higher retirement age, and that process must take place at Member State level, in conjunction with our social partners."
"There is also another side to this coin - and I see, Elisabeth, that I have your attention - and that is that we must ensure that older people remain in work."
"That, therefore, means that we should focus more efforts on flexible career schemes and flexible retirement schemes and that we must improve and adapt conditions, if older people are to be able to continue working."
"The Member States that have based their pension systems on the second pillar have been saving, often through joint employer-employee schemes, and, in some cases, in the new Member States, through mixed schemes."
"The funds have been put into savings funds, pension funds or they appear on companies' balance sheets."
"The saving and accrual systems are under less pressure than public finances, but there too, increased life expectancy is posing a problem."
"On top of that has come the financial crisis, poor results on bond and equity markets and the low interest rates that are putting guarantees on expected pensions under pressure."
"The answer which is being prepared by the Commission is as follows: the application of more stringent solvency requirements is - and I will say it here once again - not the right answer."
"Good supervision: yes!"
"What we need first, though, before adopting any laws, is an in-depth impact assessment of the effects of solvency."
"In this connection, I also wish to point to the debate on derivatives."
"You cannot link derivatives and pension funds, just like that."
"In a pension fund, derivatives are used to hedge risks."
"Hence, not for speculation."
"So even there, Commission, you must look before you leap."
"Turning now to the third pillar."
"It seems to me that we should not harbour unrealistic expectations."
"You can only use individual saving opportunities if you also have the money."
"However, what we do want to do is create greater awareness, and you get greater awareness when people are informed about their pensions, so we also need a tracking system."
"Madam President, the European internal market is absent from the third pillar, so we have to do something about that, too."
"Finally, I would like to make two concluding comments."
"On adequacy: we cannot achieve that at European level, Member States must do that."
"On transferability: in my opinion, an open labour market can only function with more free commuter traffic which does not put employees who exercise that right at a disadvantage."
"Though there, too, we need transferability: yes, but with an adaptation period, so we need new contracts and then an impact study."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Green Paper on pensions which we published last summer started a much needed debate on the future of pensions in Europe."
"It resulted in more than 100 meetings and conferences with stakeholders and we received almost 1 700 responses."
"The Green Paper outlines the key challenges facing the Union in this area, and asked fourteen questions about how work at EU level could help the Member States in ensuring that pensions are adequate, sustainable and safe, while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Green Paper takes a holistic approach, because my fellow Commissioners, Rehn and Barnier, and I are convinced that adequate, sustainable and safe pensions call for coordinated, joined-up policies spanning our three areas of responsibility."
"Let me briefly restate the Commission's reasoning for publishing the Green Paper last year."
"First, we need to overcome the imbalances resulting from the increasing divergence between life expectancy and retirement ages."
"Second, we need to adjust the European framework to reflect the changes that have come about in national pension systems after a decade of pension reforms."
"Third, we must draw lessons from the financial and economic crisis."
"The crisis has highlighted the need to review financial market exposure and the design of our pension systems in order to improve risk mitigation and enhance the funded pension's capacity for shock absorption."
"Fourth, we need to fully prepare our pension systems for the acceleration of population ageing."
"The Member States have already engaged in long-standing cooperation to learn from each other's experiences and exchange good practice in pension reform."
"There is a consensus on the need for coordination at EU level and for establishing EU rules on cross-border issues."
"For the last 10 years, coordination at EU level has underpinned Member States' efforts to modernise the pension systems, and many Member States have already made good progress in adapting the pension systems to reflect demographic ageing, changes in the labour markets and evolving gender roles."
"However, most Member States have a long way to go and a few others have not even begun with pension reforms."
"I was pleased to read the report, on which I congratulate the rapporteur, which is highly supportive of the holistic approach we have chosen."
"In several places, it highlights the links between adequacy, sustainability and safety."
"It also clearly identifies policy areas where the EU can add value."
"The Commission is currently in the final stages of analysing the results of the consultation, including the final opinion of the European Parliament."
"Given the urgency of the situation, the Commission has already started the preparations for the White Paper to be presented in the third quarter of 2011."
"Let me conclude by saying that one of the great successes of Europe's social model is to ensure that old age is not synonymous with poverty."
"This is a promise on which we have to continue to deliver and help Member States to take the right decisions to ensure that pension systems are fit for purpose."
"The last 12 months have seen a lively debate in the field of pension reforms and this year promises to be equally intense."
"I very much count on Parliament's support to bring about a real change to create both adequate and sustainable pensions for the future."
"Madam President, the fact that we are discussing pensions today in the European Parliament plenary will confirm how important they are to Europe."
"An ageing population, the impact of the economic and financial crisis and the late entry of young people into the labour market require common solutions."
"However, pensions remain a national responsibility and the purpose of the subsidiarity principle is to establish the limits of European intervention."
"Nevertheless, if Member States implement existing EU-level legislation better, we will benefit from a single market which operates more efficiently, thereby encouraging greater worker mobility."
"In addition, so that public pension systems are sustainable, we must ensure that people have the opportunity to continue working up until retirement age."
"The rise in unemployment among Member States is a matter for concern, jeopardising the principle of intergenerational solidarity."
"Indeed, steps to reform the pension system must go hand in hand with promoting employment policies."
"Similarly, pension reform must not be synonymous with depriving groups which are already vulnerable of a safe, decent income."
"States must not shirk their obligation to provide adequate pensions for all citizens."
"To avoid such exploitation at national level, we have put forward the idea of defining an adequate pension at European Union level."
"It is my view that it is not enough to ask Member States to guarantee a level of pensions from the first pillar above the poverty threshold."
"I certainly understand the argument about the diversity of national conditions and the reluctance of states to allow the European Union to be involved in a matter at the very core of national sovereignty."
"However, I think that EU bodies must show greater concern for European citizens' living conditions."
"Social discontent can trigger unexpected effects."
"Two recent examples, outside the European Union, illustrate the level of tolerance of a population which has constantly been forced to make sacrifices in the interests of national governments which pay too little attention to their citizens' needs."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) Madam President, first of all, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my fellow Member, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, for the good cooperation on her part."
"I am grateful to her for reproducing much of the opinion, if not, in fact, the entire opinion that I wrote for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO)."
"In particular, I am pleased with the recommendation that a European system be developed which will make it possible for everybody to know how much pension they have built up, regardless of which Member State(s) it was accrued in."
"Nevertheless, I do still have some questions, especially about the discrepancy between Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's statement just now and the recommendation that pension policy come under the aegis of European economic governance."
"We do not know exactly what kind of form that will take, but there is a real chance that it will not be optional."
"I do not want to give the impression, by voting in favour, that I, for example, will be contributing to the transfer of national powers on this issue to the EU."
"In addition, I am concerned about the recommendation, which is, indeed, in there, that the retirement age should be raised in the light of life expectancy."
"I believe that that is definitely not necessary for the Netherlands, and that is why I cannot endorse the recommendation."
"I would like the rapporteur to comment on this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"The lack of any significant attention to gender issues in the Commission Green Paper on the future of pension systems in Europe gives cause for concern: women are discriminated against in pension calculations because they interrupt their careers more often in order to look after their children, sick relatives and the elderly."
"To fulfil their family commitments, women are therefore more liable than men to have to accept precarious or part-time work, resulting in an average gender pay gap of 18% in the European Union."
"That leads to evident discrimination against women, who receive pensions that are clearly lower than men's."
"This increases the risk of poverty for older women, especially when the fact that they tend to live longer than men is taken into account."
"The time women devote to caring for their children or other dependent family members needs to be recognised in the calculation systems as being equivalent to all other kinds of contract when pensions are calculated."
"The Green Paper offered a consultation ..."
"To conclude, I hope the new White Paper will devote greater attention to the sensitive and worrying issue of the gender gap in the calculation of pension rights in the EU."
"Madam President, first of all, the large number of motions for amendment - there have been nearly 500 of them - is a good indication of the tremendous interest surrounding this topic, and the rapporteur, Ria Oomen-Ruijten deserves nothing but our thanks for turning this immense haystack of motions for amendment into a report which reflects the current opinion of Parliament."
"I am saying its current opinion, since we are standing at the beginning of the debate, and this is about the Green Paper, which will be followed by a White Paper, and then by additional reports, meaning that we are obviously in a stage of a larger process."
"In general, I must say that I agree with the Commission's approach, which welcomes diversification, that is, pension systems resting on multiple pillars, but, at the same time, I would like to point out that the wording could be a little more precise here."
"Obviously, when we are speaking of second pillars, we mean second pillars that supplement the first pillars in the light of their weaknesses."
"This is not the same as a second pillar where something is taken away from the first for the sole reason of operating a system in different ways."
"The former restores stability, while the latter endangers it."
"However, we must also realise - and this has perhaps been said already, but I would just like to reinforce it - that the problems of the pension system cannot necessarily be solved by themselves, from the inside; what is more, it is likely that they cannot."
"More jobs are needed, stronger economic cooperation is needed, and our goal should definitely be that once the Commission has prepared the White Paper, this common thought process should somehow be linked to the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and economic governance."
"It is obvious that, if this will be the case, we will be able to continue this debate more fruitfully."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to emphasise the important consensus work that the rapporteur has carried out."
"Congratulations, Ria!"
"During the negotiation of the compromises, she has showed open-mindedness about the arguments put forward by my group, which led to a large majority vote in favour of the draft report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"If we see this large a majority in favour tomorrow, it would send a strong signal to the other institutions."
"This report on the future of pensions in Europe is, up to now, the only European institutional document which goes against the tide of the Commission's thinking - as represented in particular by its Annual Growth Survey - and the thinking of the Merkel-Sarkozy duo in their document on the competitiveness pact."
"These documents call very directly for the first pillar to be reconsidered, and also call for an automatic increase in the legal retirement age based on life expectancy."
"Parliament, in its amended and adopted draft report, is in favour of the following: a fundamental role for the first pillar in relation to pensions, which provides a better guarantee of solidarity, with a complementary role for the other pillars, including bringing a second pillar into general use; giving more attention to increasing the actual age of retirement as well as employment levels, in particular, those of older people, rather than an automatic and fatalistic increase in the legal age; a definition of the criteria for enabling a guaranteed minimal adequate pension to be introduced in the Member States; a strengthened role for social partners in defining and implementing all pension reforms in Europe; and the abolition of disparities between men and women in relation to pensions, which is linked to the discrimination of which Mrs Matera reminded us."
"With these components, with these advances, as well as others that I could have mentioned, I am satisfied that Parliament can send our Commissioner a clear message, a social and progressive message, and I hope that she will take this into account for the next stage of the White Paper."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur for her good work; she certainly made my life easier."
"I also want to thank the Commission for starting this discussion, which is certainly very timely."
"Some people speak of the pensions time bomb and, given some of the figures that I have seen estimating the gap between what we currently put aside for both public and private pension provision and the resources we will need to ensure adequate pension provision for the next forty years, that gap is huge."
"So, in that context, the phrase 'pensions time bomb' is certainly accurate."
"Well, we all know what we need to do with a time bomb: we need to defuse it."
"I think this is the start of that process."
"But the core question is: who is responsible?"
"I think in the report, we are clear that Member States are themselves responsible for making sure that there is adequate pension provision for their citizens."
"But, we also state that the economies of Member States are interdependent and therefore, a coordination of pension policies using the OMC is certainly useful."
"However, we do not believe it is possible for the EU to set adequate pension levels or, indeed, to harmonise retirement ages."
"Nonetheless, we do consider that Member States should define adequacy as the condition required for older people to live a decent life."
"I am pleased we have highlighted the gender issue and asked Member States to deal with the issue of men and women who take time off to care and that we have paid attention to the issue of mobility and the role of the EU 2020 strategy."
"Finally, I support the inclusion of pension liabilities within the SGP."
"We know that a fiscal black hole is opening up in the area of pension provision and we just cannot ignore it."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I, too, would like to add my voice to that of others who thanked our rapporteur for the very good work that has been done on this report."
"We are all aware there are national differences, as well as differences within our own political groups, and to come up with anything that gains a significant level of support is quite something."
"My group is especially pleased that the report before us recognises the importance of first-pillar pensions, the commitment to an adequate level, the issue of being able to provide a decent life."
"After all, we spent all of last year, 2010, dealing with questions of poverty."
"And, of course, this is also, for many people, a fixed income, an essential guarantee."
"Like others, we also welcome the recognition that we need to tackle decent pension provision here for women."
"We also recognise the importance of tackling discrimination against older workers and using other measures to help people stay in work."
"For us, too, the portability of pension rights is a crucial issue."
"More and more people are not working for one company throughout their working life."
"Indeed, they are working for several, and not always in the same country."
"And we need to avoid this fragmentation of pension provision, so there is an essential role for the European Union there."
"We are also pleased to see that this report contains a commitment for second-pillar provision, that it should be available without discrimination on grounds of age, gender and work contract."
"We would agree as well - and are pleased to see it there - that we need to be adopting more of a life course approach that deals with the different rhythms and patterns of modern working lives, both positive and negative."
"And again we recognise the importance of solidarity in that first pillar, not least for those whose working lives are involved with more casual labour, short-term contracts and so on."
"We are concerned at any effort to push third-pillar private pension provision and we agree that it is crucial that people have adequate and clear information."
"We would also welcome the fact that this report contains - if there is going to be a change in pension provision - adequate time for adaptation for people to reconsider their financial futures."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, my group supports the publication of this Green Paper."
"It is very timely and comes at a time when we are, in all Member States, debating the issues which have already been mentioned and which I will not labour - changing demographics, the gender challenge, to name just two."
"The report recognises the importance of Member States sharing best practice and exchanging information, but also emphasises that pensions remain a Member State competence."
"It acknowledges that the EU should not legislate on the adequacy of pension levels and retirement ages, but asks - and asks very clearly and very strongly - that Member States regulate in accordance with their own circumstances, taking account of those issues."
"I do believe that further work on portability is essential to strengthen the single market."
"EU citizens working around Europe - and I have met many - should not be left disadvantaged by having their pension pots frozen in different Member States."
"Demographics change and so do working practices."
"Our expectations change, but it is vital that we keep up with these changes in our thinking and our policy making."
"Madam President, in this debate, we cannot forget that there is a proposal for a so-called competitiveness pact by means of which the directorate, led by Germany, wishes to launch new attacks on the universal and mutual public social security system, to increase pension age and devalue salaries, attempting to put an end to their indexation to inflation, merely to benefit the financial sector, which is trying to find in these pensions new types of greater speculative gains."
"We would like to state our clear opposition to this path towards European integration, built upon a foundation of antisocial policies which, lamentably, this report endorses, by supporting the European Commission Green Paper, by allowing a link to be made between the legal retirement age and life expectancy, by encouraging people to stay in the job market longer, and by not excluding support for private pension systems even when it is already known that their speculative use by funds and private banks can have severe consequences which leave the elderly, and particularly elderly women, in poverty."
"We have therefore tabled an alternative resolution, which demonstrates that it is possible to improve benefits and pensions without increasing the legal age for retirement, provided that there is more employment with rights, particularly for young people, better salaries, and greater supervision of the financial sector and financial transactions."
"We are against the increase in retirement age and we defend the pensions system integrated in the universal and mutual public social security system, which increases the value of smaller benefits and pensions, respects elderly people and allows them to live with dignity, thereby contributing to the eradication of poverty."
"This is what our citizens expect, through the struggles that we have had in Portugal, France, Greece, and so many other places."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 22 November last year, the rapporteur said that pensions were exclusively a competence of the Member State."
"Now this has become something more like: although Member States have the lead, there are aspects where coordination at European level is important."
"In paragraph 9, the resolution stresses Member States' competence but calls on them to coordinate their different pension policies."
"There is double speak here, with EU control overturning principle."
"The UK National Association of Pension Funds says that this report will make pensions more expensive - by 90% according to actuarial consultants Punter Southall."
"If that is exaggerated, it is certainly true that huge extra sums will be needed to prevent pensions collapsing, so premiums will rise massively."
"Pension firms and Member States do not need this report; they need help to keep premiums down."
"Otherwise, this misguided report has the potential to destroy that which it seeks to protect."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Europe of the Stability Pact - and tomorrow the competitiveness pact - pension reforms are in the firing line."
"How can we save pensions when the European Union requires the Member States, which are now in deficit, to have balanced their budgets by 2013?"
"Your solution is to push the retirement age up to 67 and to carry out profound reforms of pay-as-you-go pension systems to reduce benefits for insured people."
"Furthermore, the report is not wrong there, since it calls for a guaranteed minimum level for pensions, which you are forcing us to guarantee to foreigners arriving on our shores who have never contributed."
"Moreover, counting direct public pension liabilities, as advocated in this report, will further increase the pressure on the Member States and will force them to develop pension funds based on capital formation, and we are obviously well aware of the major risks these pose."
"Pension systems fall within the competence of the Member States."
"Yet, against the wishes of the people, you are introducing an unprecedented budgetary stringency."
"Employed people, civil servants and retired people in Europe will be the adjustment variable in order to save the euro and to save your ultra-liberal Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, it is good that just for once, an own-initiative report is not being hidden away on a Monday and dealt with in just a few minutes."
"This is a result of the 463 amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the 211 amendments from the associated Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I would have liked to have seen a commitment to continuing the successful occupational pension systems in Germany, Luxembourg, Finland and Austria."
"Unfortunately, there was a majority decision to recommend new minimum standards and the application of Solvency II to occupational pensions."
"This will bring the risk of significantly higher costs, which, in Germany alone, could amount to an increase of 40% on the voluntary occupational pension."
"We must not destroy what has been achieved on the basis of a consensus between unions and management."
"I was able to contribute to the compromises by proposing that in future, all the effects of the minimum standards and of Solvency II must be evaluated in detail in an in-depth impact assessment."
"That represents progress towards the continuation of occupational pensions, although it is by no means a guarantee."
"One positive point is that we do not have a standardised definition of adequate pension levels."
"In addition, the proposal of a harmonised retirement age for the EU has been rejected."
"Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy are rightly in favour of the gradual convergence of the pension systems and the retirement age."
"As birth rates and life expectancy vary in different countries, each national pension system must be adapted to meet demographic changes."
"The compromises were achieved under serious time pressure."
"I hope that we will all be able to hold a more detailed debate on the White Paper, which will include the practical experience of businesses."
"The amounts involved in voluntary occupational pensions alone are greater than those in the current EU rescue package."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 (8))"
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President. look, I do not want there to be any misunderstanding about this."
"I therefore ask you, Mr Mann, to specify where in this report it says that solvency will compulsorily apply to second-pillar pensions?"
"I, personally, am against that, but where does it say that?"
"(DE) Madam President, we have had two reports from two committees which recommend applying Solvency II to occupational pension systems."
"In my opinion, this simply will not work."
"In countries such as France, they have experience of this, but not in other Member States of the European Union."
"We should investigate this issue in detail."
"We will have the chance, when we consider the White Paper and discuss it in depth, to convince everyone of this, because many people do not have the relevant experience and have not yet come across this in their own countries."
"This is a good opportunity for us to do the groundwork."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, we are here in an orientation debate and the European Parliament wanted to make you pass on a message."
"However, in the meantime, the world is moving and the question of pensions is being mentioned in addition."
"I obviously want to mention here the reference to a standardised retirement system, at European level, at 67 years of age, which has been created in what was a draft competitiveness pact."
"We can clearly see that if we start from there in constructing a social Europe, well, we will be constructing it against the people, and that is not what we want."
"In Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, we mention other orientations on many points, and I would ask you, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, to take account of that when you develop the Commission's position around a White Paper, concerning taking account of the issue of gender, which you have not taken into account sufficiently."
"We also mention the idea that the best means of deciding the question of retirement is to encourage employment and that rather than fixating on the legal retirement age, we must take account of real age."
"However, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report contains, in the view of the French Socialists, an indication which poses us a problem, and with which we will not be able to agree."
"You understand that, for us, the idea that increased life expectancy must automatically be indexed with legal age of retirement constitutes a regressive step in terms of social rights, and one which we cannot support."
"Finally, allow me a final word to say to you that, without social dialogue, without the involvement of social partners in the whole of these negotiations, we will go to the wall."
"(NL) Madam President, it seems to me that, with the help of the rapporteur, we have come up with a number of very balanced answers to the question put by the Commission."
"There are two points where, in my opinion, the European Union does indeed bring added value."
"If we recognise the importance of the first pillar, which makes sense, then we must also admit, at the same time, that the health of our public finances is equally important, since it is sound public finances that underpin the first pillar."
"Next, you have to recognise the long-term strain that pensions are putting on the government and make that very clear."
"I think that the Commission and the European Union have a responsibility to make that clear to each Member State, so that everyone can see where the risks and the difficulties lie."
"My second point is that the European Union plays a particular role in the second pillar, as well."
"There, you have pointed to the importance of Solvency II."
"What we are asking for here is that the Commission examine the risks in the longer term and that it makes clear in its rules how those risks should be hedged."
"I think that there, you have to specifically consider the long-term risk of pension systems in general: not just of one type, but of all pensions systems under the second pillar."
"So, there is a job that needs doing."
"When I look at the figures, as Mrs Harkin has done, I am afraid that we have not hedged all the risks in all the Member States of the European Union."
"(PL) Madam President, the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament, as discussed during the consultations held by the European Commission, deserves our support."
"The resolution recommends stepping up mutual intra-state coordination and exchange of best practices without, at the same time, interfering in Member States' competences as regards pension systems, which is an extremely important and very sensitive area."
"During the debate held in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I stressed the importance of demographic developments for the security and future form of pension systems."
"It is therefore extremely important for us to take all possible measures aimed at overcoming the demographic crisis in Europe."
"When assessing pension systems and formulating proposals, I also believe that we should take into account the significant differences between the individual Member States, both with regard to their financial capabilities and in terms of the public and occupational capital-based pension systems which currently already exist."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the prosperity of a country is created through the work of its people."
"In future, jobs in the social sector must be better paid."
"People want proper, secure pensions in their old age."
"One clear message from the crisis is that only public and state pensions are reliable and stable."
"In contrast, occupational and private pension funds have lost millions of euro on the stock exchange."
"It is ridiculous to increase the focus on private, capital-based pension systems when providing for people's retirement."
"The public has financed the rescue packages for the major banks."
"The people are paying for a tough austerity policy which is under the control of the European Union."
"Now, they are supposed to turn around national budgets by taking cuts in their pensions and accepting a higher retirement age."
"Previous pension reforms are already leading to increasing poverty in old age."
"The only solution is to strengthen the reliable public pension systems."
"(DE) Madam President, the population pyramid in the EU will soon be turned upside down and the over 55 age group will represent the largest proportion of the population."
"Life expectancy will continue to increase and the birth rate will remain low."
"Young people will be starting work later and later."
"We are all aware of the consequences of this: an ageing population and an increasing number of bottlenecks when it comes to the financing of pensions."
"What we need is a family-friendly policy in Europe, such as the introduction of family tax splitting for income tax or equivalent social measures, which take into account the contribution that the family makes to the intergenerational contract by reducing the burden of taxes on families."
"In addition, we need to create incentives to keep older people in work for as long as possible."
"I would like to give Mr Andor a clear message. The very popular policy of mass immigration is the wrong way to go about safeguarding our pensions and it also ultimately puts social peace in Europe at risk."
"(PL) Madam President, demographic changes, longer lifespans and a falling birth rate, various privileges granted under pension systems and the economic crisis have placed enormous pressure on the public finances of the Member States."
"We are being forced to ask questions on an increasingly frequent basis regarding the stability and security of current pension systems, and regarding the extent to which they guarantee fair incomes during retirement."
"We are coming to the conclusion that reforms of Europe's pension systems, which fall under the competences of the Member States, are essential."
"This will be a very long-winded and expensive process, and in order for governments to decide to take such a step, the Council and the European Commission need to guarantee that the costs of these reforms will always be taken into account when applying the excessive deficit procedure."
"Any other solution may result in a situation where countries abandon reforms for fear of the financial burden."
"I should like to refer to two key aspects of these essential reforms."
"Firstly, in order to guarantee the security of pension systems, we must diversify income sources and create systems based, inter alia, on public funding from capital markets and employee pension schemes."
"Secondly, we should ensure higher rates of employment in order to guarantee the stability of pension systems."
"The Member States should endeavour to ensure that the actual age of retirement is the same as the statutory age, and, wherever necessary, consider extending the statutory age of retirement, as a natural consequence of the fact that Europeans are living longer and longer."
"Extended working lives should, however, be associated with corresponding labour market reforms, including the provision of appropriate training and healthcare for employees."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and to thank her for her help and her excellent cooperation while working on the report."
"(ES) Madam President, it has already been said that the backbone of pension systems in Europe is, and must continue to be, the public system, because it is the only system that guarantees cohesion and, moreover, reduces the risk of poverty in our society."
"It is nevertheless striking that, in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the greatest levels of equality in terms of income are found in pensions, or that, due to the crisis, private pensions lost 20% of their value in 2008 alone and are currently still far from meeting the required levels of solvency."
"All of this shows that, at a time of unavoidable reforms, measures to ensure the sustainability of our pension systems must be cross-cutting, taking into account, among other factors, ambitious policies concerning birth rates and balancing work and family life, along with ambitious policies for ensuring that people can enter and remain in employment, or even immigration policies based on integration, which also guarantee the sustainability of our pensions from a demographic point of view."
"Finally, I find it regrettable that the text does not place limits on the abuse of the concept of grants in businesses, because, as a general rule, they are exempt from any social contributions."
"In my view, this is essential for a whole new generation of workers, as if more is being required of them in order to have a decent pension, they should also not have to suffer so much in order to access decent employment."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Ria Oomen-Ruijten for all her hard work on this."
"I think she has done a very good job."
"This makes it very clear that pensions are, first and foremost, the responsibility of Member States."
"Thankfully, we have rejected any call for a minimum pension at EU level, as well as for a Solvency II-type regulation to be applied to pensions."
"The Lisbon Treaty makes it very clear that it is Member States, not the EU, who are responsible for pension provision."
"But what we can do is share best practice and experience."
"I am pleased that my amendment calling for the implementation of the Employment Directive 2000 to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of age is also included."
"With regard to the retirement age, I have always made it clear that we must keep a pensionable age - an age when you are entitled to claim your pension - set at Member State level but, at the same time, scrap the compulsory retirement age, which forces people to stop working even if they want to carry on."
"I am sorry that this was not in the report."
"(CS) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has made an excellent job of tackling the many hundreds of amendments submitted."
"Although the report is not legislative, it is of great importance for the future of the social systems in EU Member States."
"The main conclusions which we support are that:"
"decisions on pension systems are political decisions and are fully and exclusively the responsibility of the individual Member States;"
"it is essential to raise the retirement age;"
"the only source of growth in the EU in the coming years will be growth in the productivity of labour;"
"it is a key task to support the employment of older workers, particularly through greater flexibility in employment law relationships and the correct adjustment of pension systems;"
"it is not appropriate to coordinate pension systems and their reform at EU level;"
"we do not support a standardisation of the retirement age across the EU, nor do we support linking it to average life expectancy;"
"we do not support any efforts to unify definitions, for example, the definition of an adequate pension, at Community level."
"(NL) Madam President, subsidiarity, a matter for individual Member States, and solidarity, those were the two things that the rapporteur kept emphasising about pension policy."
"I therefore thought that she would immediately relegate the pro-spending cuts Green Paper to the wastepaper basket."
"I nearly fell off my chair when the rapporteur actually referred to the Green Paper as a positive thing."
"While, on the one hand, the rapporteur keeps going on about subsidiarity, on the other, she has made countless proposals for increasing the EU's influence."
"The EU should provide the criteria for the minimum pension."
"The EU should persuade Member States to raise the retirement age."
"The EU should encourage competition between European pension funds and further privatisation."
"Subsidiarity?"
"What subsidiarity?"
"If all of this were going to lead to more socially responsible pension systems, then, perhaps, you could justify the EU's influence here."
"Unfortunately, the Commission and the rapporteur are giving primacy to the internal market and they will only increase the divide between the rich and the poor."
"(MT) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the extraordinary work she has carried out in this report."
"The report recognises that in a time in which European Union citizens are particularly vulnerable, it is essential that the Member States ensure that social protection measures, and pensions in particular, are higher and more reliable, thus guaranteeing peace of mind to an ever ageing population, and ensuring that they remain economically independent."
"Here, I would like to underline how important it is that the Member States define the necessary criteria in order to safeguard a decent standard of living for senior citizens."
"This has to be determined by the specific circumstances pertaining to each country and therefore, the principle of subsidiarity has to be respected."
"I welcome, however, the invitation to the Commission to introduce guidelines and to encourage the exchange of best practice."
"In this way, the decisions taken will be in the interest of those who are going to be directly affected."
"In many Member States, pension reform is vital if we are to fulfil the objectives mentioned in the Green Paper; that is, having sound, adequate and sustainable pension systems."
"The reform can be a difficult one to implement, especially in these difficult times, and therefore, the reform expenditure also needs to be taken into consideration within the context of economic governance."
"(HU) Madam President, along with several Members who spoke before me, I believe it is important that there should be as much European level coordination on the pensions issue as possible."
"One reason for this is that the crisis has raised the question of macro-economic stability, and it has also raised the question of how we can ensure security and dignity in old age."
"It is apparent that different kinds of change are taking place in the Member States."
"Some countries are embarking on the path of reform, and are reinforcing or creating the pillar of private pension funds, while others are attempting to turn back time instead."
"Whatever the nature of the change may be, however, it is very important to make the sustainability of pensions, stability, and a dignified old age the top priorities."
"All changes must be consulted upon with the social partners, and sufficient time must be provided for transitions."
"The people, the citizens, must be informed about what changes will be implemented and how these will affect them, in order to enable them to make informed decisions in all cases, and all changes must be made in a citizen-friendly manner."
"Madam President, when Bismarck introduced a state pension in 1889, the average life expectancy was just 45."
"Today we live longer, but face the challenge of how to achieve reasonable incomes in retirement."
"Economic, demographic and labour market traditions vary."
"Individual countries should be responsible for their own policies and reforms."
"Sustainable state pensions need sustainable public finances, but this Parliament's report is clear: there cannot be a harmonised EU retirement age or minimum income level."
"Company schemes and individual savings should be portable from one employer to another, and across countries."
"Savers deserve transparent information, which is easy to understand and available."
"Yes, we need safe saving schemes, but rules on capital must be intelligent."
"Risks for pensions are not the same as insurance companies or banks."
"The cost of regulation falls on the consumer and, in this case, the old-age pensioner."
"(FR) Madam President, first, I would like to say that the crisis and demographics are combining to confront us with this problem regarding pensions in all the Member States of the European Union."
"In the work that is being done, I would first like to welcome the step forward that is the consultation work that the Commissioner told us that she presided over in the development of this Green Paper, but also the work, based on consultation, open-mindedness and compromise, that was carried out by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in order to draft this report."
"I would like to emphasise three points that we absolutely must take into account in order to resolve the problem of the solvency of pensions."
"The first point is the inequality faced by women of retirement age, because inequality in employment leads to poverty at retirement age."
"The second point, Commissioner, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, is that I want to make sure that widows' pensions are saved."
"We still have a generation of poor women who have not worked during their potential working life and for whom widows' pensions are the only way of getting a minimum pension."
"The third point is the entry of the younger generations on to the labour market."
"They not only have to face the crisis, but they also have to carry the burden of several generations: their children, their parents and their grandparents."
"Finally, that poses the problem of senior citizens, a problem which we must deal with more quickly in our work."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, pensions throughout Europe must provide enough money for people to live on."
"One important requirement is that people have decent jobs, because low paid jobs result in poverty in old age and inadequate pension provision."
"When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age, I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn, never mind paying for an additional private pension."
"This is why the first pillar of the pension system is of particular importance."
"The pay-as-you-go system based on the solidarity principle must form the foundation of European pensions and it must provide enough for people to live on."
"We cannot simply say that this is a matter for the Member States."
"We must send out a clear signal that we need pensions which give people enough money to have a reasonable quality of life."
"Mr Mann gave a detailed description of the German occupational pension system."
"I would like to mention it too, without going into the same level of detail."
"In my assessment of the Green Paper, I have come to the same conclusion, which is why we worked on the amendments together in committee."
"Therefore, I am calling on the Commission to ensure that, in everything which we do in future, the distinctive features of each country - the things that really work well and are essential for the survival of the pension systems in the Member States - are not disregarded."
"(RO) Madam President, I believe that we need to be realistic and acknowledge that the current public pension systems, based on the transfer of resources between generations, known as the 'pay as you go' principle, are no longer economically viable and, as such, they require public budget subsidies to survive."
"The ageing population trend and increasing labour mobility only serve to exacerbate the imbalances in these pension systems, while the measures being proposed, whether raising the retirement age or increasing contributions, are limited and will be increasingly restricted as well by social resistance to measures of this kind. Ultimately, we will have to acknowledge that the solution is to switch to those pension systems where people build up their own pension fund over the course of their working life."
"(HU) Madam President, the European Union has addressed a great many issues related to people with disabilities."
"Unfortunately, it is this very social group that Member States' pension systems do not really seem to cover, which is unacceptable."
"In addition to people who were forced to enter the disability pension system through no fault of their own, there are a great many who entered the system by abusing loopholes."
"This problem primarily affects the pension systems of Central and Eastern Europe, where there is a very large number of such abusers."
"Their numbers are so high that they are shaking the foundations of the pension system itself."
"This situation goes against the EU 2020 strategy."
"These people are receiving non-personalised services instead of real assistance, while they could hold their own in the labour market and would be capable of working."
"Current forecasts indicate that the number of dependants in Europe will soon double."
"Meanwhile, the number of working age people is dropping by one million per year."
"In summary, this means that there is currently no sustainable pension system, especially not without active people with disabilities."
"I wholly support the idea of the rapporteur that in the EU, which is home to 50 million people with disabilities, only forty-odd percent of these people are working."
"Where is the other sixty-odd percent?"
"The bottom line is that they, too, should be working."
"(EL) Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her efforts to strike the necessary balance between the economic viability and the social adequacy of pension systems, given that, in times of high unemployment, deregulation of the labour market, wage cuts and serious demographic challenges, the creation and consolidation of adequate, socially fair and economically viable pension systems is a major challenge for every Member State."
"However, systems must be based on the first pillar, the public, redistributive pillar, as the only basic guarantee of adequate benefits."
"This pillar should be supplemented, not supported by the second pillar, which should function in tandem, once care has been taken to safeguard not only universal access to it, but also its security, by establishing the relevant governance framework."
"In addition, linking a later retirement age to life expectancy does not, by any means, result in automatic adjustments."
"Of course, other parameters have to be factored in, such as location, nature of work, very unhealthy occupations, quality of life and health."
"Finally, any incentives to remain in work should, as a precondition, include safety valves to overcome any barriers which might prevent young people from accessing the labour market, especially at a time when unemployment has, unfortunately, soared to invisible heights."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Madam President, the debates being held in certain EU Member States regarding pension systems, and the public emotions accompanying these debates, show how important and, at the same time, how difficult this subject is."
"It will not be possible to adopt a single pensions model which would apply in all EU Member States."
"However, at a time of economic crisis and demographic change, reforms of national pension systems are becoming unavoidable."
"It is already the case today that many countries are experiencing problems due to the growing cost of pensions, and such problems may undermine the principle of intergenerational solidarity."
"However, we must remember that pensions must be secure and safe, and that they must take into account what we are paid."
"In this context, I would like greater attention to be paid to the pay difference between women and men, since women's lower earnings result in reduced pension benefits."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to mention that, even at the start of this debate, the Commissioner was talking about the successes of the European social model."
"One of these is also the achievement of equal opportunities for women and men."
"I hope that this report will send a clear message about integrating gender equality as part of achieving a fair pension system."
"This is why I want, if I may, to emphasise three points."
"Firstly, the assessment of the impact on society and female employment of measures to recognise work done in the home, including the use of a costed calculation of this work for pension purposes."
"I call on the Commission to initiate the procedure aimed at removing Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/113/EC which allows for discrimination against women in the case of pension products."
"(ES) Madam President, the pensions system is a basic element of the European social model that must be preserved."
"It is the responsibility of the Member States, but in order to guarantee its survival, we need to take measures, with the highest possible level of agreement with social partners and civil society."
"These measures need to be focused on setting a European standard that guarantees the solvency of all systems by making them subject to supervision criteria in order to limit the deficit in public finances across the Member States, and by extending the guarantees that are going to be demanded of insurance companies from 2013 to the mutual societies that manage these systems in some Member States."
"This standard needs to be set in order to rationalise the debate, because solving this problem means more than setting the retirement age in law."
"We need to take into account a person's length of employment and contribution levels, and incorporate factors associated with the desires of retired people."
"Extending one's working life must result in an improved pension."
"This standard also needs to look to the future."
"The mobility of workers is going to require that transferring passive rights from one country to another will not be a problem."
"When they move countries, Europeans need to be able to access their employment history in all the Member States where they have made contributions."
"I also think that we need to pay particular attention to gender and disability."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Andor, I would like to ask whether it makes sense to respond to this debate and this report with a White Paper."
"Should we not instead be attempting to resolve the really urgent problems?"
"In my view, there are two issues: one is the fact that there is a huge gap between the actual retirement age and the state retirement age."
"This means that the anti-discrimination measures really need to be put into effect, in the form of action or monitoring by the Commission to improve the situation, because that will make pensions sustainable."
"The other is that the report clearly calls for action to be taken now on the portability of occupational pensions, which means considering a new directive."
"This is much more urgent, because workers who move from one company to another lose a lot of money on their pensions, which would give them security in their old age."
"This is why we need to take steps in this area."
"With the White Paper, we are just wasting time."
"(LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the economic crisis and the ageing of the population, contributions to social security budgets are falling."
"That is a generally recognised fact."
"The number of pensioners is increasing."
"This poses a threat to the sustainability of the pensions system."
"It is essential to adapt the social security and pensions system to today's challenges."
"I agree with the Commissioner when he said it would take a great deal of hard work to produce this document."
"Nevertheless, I believe that we must establish a social fund on an EU-wide scale, equivalent to the Cohesion Fund, with the aim of assisting pensioners in those countries with relatively low revenues."
"National budgets cannot secure a decent old age."
"We already have experience of this."
"Last year, we fought against poverty, and the result is that we have more poor people than before."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like again to congratulate all the committees that have been involved in the discussion and also in producing the reports."
"I realise that it is hard to bring the positions from so many different political and national backgrounds into line, but the votes in committees involved show that the reports have been met with wide support."
"This sends a clear signal to the Commission on the follow-up to the Green Paper."
"I expect to publish a summary early next month with Parliament's opinion included."
"We will follow this up in the second half of 2011 with the White Paper, which I mentioned in my earlier intervention, accompanied by a suitable impact assessment."
"This will give all stakeholders the opportunity once again to continue playing a part in the debate."
"The Commissioners' Group on pensions already discussed last week possible policy options on how to update and improve the European framework on pensions."
"There was agreement that we should continue with the holistic approach to the pension reforms."
"As part of this, we need to continue a dialogue with the key stakeholders, both on possible new regulatory initiatives in such fields as portability, occupational pension schemes and insolvency protection, and other softer forms of regulation, such as codes of good practice."
"We also decided to deal with the gender dimension in depth and also address it more extensively in the White Paper than in the Green Paper."
"In the meantime, I would like to make sure that the Green Paper and the White Paper do not get mixed up with other flying objects in the European sky."
"The Commission has absolutely nothing in common with approaches that assume that there could be a uniform retirement age in the European Union."
"Diversity is key in the EU and it also applies to diversity of the demographic reality, and we have to study that more deeply now than before."
"We should also recognise that ongoing reforms carry new risks as they make future pensions far more dependent on long-term developments in the labour market and financial markets."
"This means that we need to create employment opportunities also for people with disabilities and increase the stability of financial systems."
"I look forward to continued work with Parliament and its committees on this very important subject."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to credit my fellow Members who have worked with me on this report: George Cutaş, Barbara Matera and Cornelis de Jong."
"I do not know where Mr de Jong is."
"There he is, at the back."
"He has made a few comments which I do not understand, for example, when he says that we want to find a European solution for everything."
"That is not true."
"Subsidiarity is the guiding principle here."
"If I could clarify the point where Mr de Jong had an issue with economic governance: we want the kind of economic governance that will ensure that everybody who is trying their level best will come out a winner."
"That is what we want, and not for a number of Member States - the ten which have written us a letter - to be penalised for having made good provisions for the future, for their pensions."
"I hope that satisfies you, Mr de Jong."
"Kartika Liotard is not here, but I am struck that she does not appear to have read the report and, yet, she comments as if she had."
"Madam President, I have already thanked my fellow Members Cutaş, Matera and De Jong, but I would also like to thank Frédéric Daerden, Marianne Harkin, Julie Girling and Jean Lambert, who have spoken on behalf of their respective groups, as well as Danuta Jazłowiecka, the shadow rapporteur from my own party, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), for having made this report what it is."
"I think that we have produced a sound analysis of what needs to be done."
"I also know that there are still some very sensitive issues in the report which concern individual Member States."
"Nevertheless, I hope that we, the Committee, and you, Commissioner Andor, have helped put things on the right track, that we will be able to rally round the White Paper, as well, in this Parliament, and that everyone will also vote in favour of it."
"It was a tough dossier, but I hope that tomorrow we will be able to say: 'all's well that ends well'."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday tomorrow (Wednesday, 16 February 2011)."
"I would remind those of you who have not had the opportunity to speak that, if you wish, you can submit a written statement not exceeding 200 words which will be annexed to the verbatim report of proceedings, should you wish to keep a record of what you wanted to say if you had been able to do so."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The most vulnerable pension system in the EU is the public system, based on intergenerational solidarity."
"However, a pension is an inherited right and governments cannot violate it, whether there is a crisis or not, even if some governments, such as the Romanian Government, feel free to do anything they want regarding the pension amount and the method for calculating it."
"The demographic situation is not in our favour either."
"Therefore, the system's sustainability is an urgent problem."
"However, public pension systems are not financed by governments, but by those who contribute to them: social partners, employees and employers, regardless of their type."
"These systems are severely affected by two factors: illegal work and the inability of Europe's economies to create new jobs offering decent pay and of a reasonable duration."
"Poorly paid, precarious jobs, on the pretext of making the labour market more flexible, mean that public systems will be permanently in crisis."
"I find it encouraging that the European Parliament resolution on pension systems emphasises the discrimination against women with regard to the pension amount, even though the age and period of time for making contributions will be virtually the same as those for men."
"This is a first step towards righting an injustice, which must be followed by subsequent measures."
"The European Commission's Green Paper presents convincing arguments as to why we need to improve current pension systems."
"However, we must not forget that most of the solutions proposed are socially sensitive."
"We must therefore evaluate carefully not only the benefits of these solutions, but also the potential risks, particularly when we are talking about increasing the retirement age or Member States losing influence in pension policy."
"Although the Commission considers raising the retirement age to be one of the less painful ways of adapting to increasing life expectancy, it does not provide specific proposals on the employment of elderly people in the labour market."
"With the possibility of delaying retirement, many unemployed people under the pensionable age may land in the poverty trap."
"Insufficient consideration has also been given to how much people's health will allow them to work longer."
"Furthermore, we must take into account the fact that women take lower paid or part-time work more often than men and that due to childbirth and motherhood, and caring for children and disabled family members, they lose insurance guarantees and ultimately receive smaller pensions."
"I feel that we must also focus more on other means of improving pension systems, such as timing the start of working life, better reconciliation of work and family life, a 'flexible' assessment of retirement age, the introduction of minimum standards for pensions, etc."
"In any case, I would view the Green Paper as a serious step towards ensuring normal living conditions for current and future pensioners."
"Changing demographic indicators and longer life expectancies urge us to develop a new strategy with regard to our pension systems."
"We must redefine issues concerning the future in relation to the young and the old, in order to be able to ensure the sustainable, secure and appropriate disbursement of pensions."
"There are major differences between European Member States in terms of their pension systems."
"While Western European countries are struggling with the problems of increasing current and future costs, new Member States are attempting to set up diversified systems."
"While, in 2008, there were four employees to support every pensioner, in 2020, there will be five."
"The reasons for this include the fact that, due to their longer, more comprehensive training, European youths enter the labour market at a later age, and that the employment relationships of employees do not last until the statutory retirement age."
"We need to establish a system which is sustainable and guarantees pensions by taking into account the situation of the Member States."
"We must also consider the possibility of free movement within the EU."
"We must start with the assumption that the effective and successful labour market of the new generation will also require mobility."
"For the future reform of pension systems, it will be essential to link the first and second pillars, which are already partially overlapping in the various Member States, and these must also be closely linked to the third pillar."
"We must also endeavour to eliminate illegal employment, which has a similarly crucial role in the preservation of our pension systems."
"The ageing population trend facing Europe in recent years is bringing about major changes in the field of medicine and consumption habits, as well as to the population structure and social security system."
"In these circumstances, ensuring pension systems' viability in the future is closely linked to how long EU citizens are effectively active on the labour market."
"I feel it is beneficial that the EU 2020 strategy supports an active, focused labour market policy, which will help increase the employment rate of older workers, women, members of minority groups and the long-term unemployed."
"By achieving this objective, I believe that Europe will see an increase in the number of people in work and, by extension, economic growth, which will have a positive impact on the viability of pension systems at EU level."
"We all know that there is no such thing as an ideal model for pension systems."
"Every country has developed its own solutions and has plans for future reforms which are adapted accordingly."
"In spite of the significant differences between the individual systems, I believe that the European Union should indicate the direction to be followed by all Member States when making changes."
"It was emphasised many times in committee that the financial and economic crisis of recent years has highlighted the urgent need to carry out reforms of the pension systems."
"The principles of solidarity and subsidiarity oblige us to strengthen cooperation between the Member States in this area."
"Sharing our experiences will enable us to avoid wasting time on duplication, which has already led to disaster in one country, and exchanging information on best practices will make it possible to develop the best strategies effectively."
"Let us not forget that the reforms must not be limited merely to raising contributions and extending the period during which contributions are made."
"Budgetary stability, the cross-border coordination of pensions, the development of minimum guarantees and equal rights for women and men are only some of the issues which should be the subject of deliberations in every Member State."
"A sustainable system based on mutually dependent and complementary pillars should be developed throughout Europe, incorporating public, employee and private pensions, as well as capital and non-capital pensions."
"I believe that this solution will guarantee the creation of stable and fair pension systems which will, at the same time, remain flexible enough to adapt to the social and economic changes we are experiencing."
"Due to their ageing populations, nearly all countries in the world are facing the question of how to finance pension systems based mainly on flexible funding in the future."
"I welcome Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's excellent report, which opens up the possibility of a solution, while respecting subsidiarity."
"I would like to mention a solution which has been promoted for many years by the Christian and Democratic Union - Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-ČSL) in the Czech Republic."
"Children who are in gainful employment should have the option to redirect part of their mandatory contributions to the flexible system to their parents' pension account, and partially offset the costs expended on their care in childhood through this contribution to a higher pension for their parents."
"This individualised inter-generational solidarity would, on the one hand, be fairer for today's pensioners, who have done a decent job of raising the new generation, while, on the other, it would surely help towards rehabilitating social attitudes to large families."
"It should pay to have children, rather than just being a cost."
"This is the key to a permanent solution both to the consequences and to the main cause of our pension problem."
"Ten years of work on a Green Paper erroneously entitled 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems' has resulted in nothing more than a random collection of nonsensical assertions."
"I do not know how it is in other countries, but in the Czech Republic, for example, the projected birth rates drawn up by experts 10 years ago differ so dramatically from the current state of affairs that the assertions of the Green Paper for the 2040-2060 period are, in my opinion, nonsensical."
"If the experts are unable to predict the development of the birth rate even over five to seven years, how can their forecast for a period of more than 30 years have any value?"
"The entire Green Paper is based on the erroneous assumption that, as long as I impose a legal obligation on the taxpayer to invest a portion of the resources assigned to the pension system into a fund not guaranteed by the state, he will get a higher pension that he would from the first pillar alone."
"A responsible constitutional court would necessarily describe such a law as unconstitutional."
"Even in countries where the second pillar has been introduced in the past, it apparently failed to produce the expected results."
"For example, in Chile in the 1970s, after the overthrow of Pinochet, private funds not guaranteed by the state became mandatory for citizens outside the army and the police."
"Why was this?"
"Why is the current conservative government in Hungary also dismantling the ineffective second pillar of pension provision?"
"These are the main reasons why the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left cannot vote for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report."
"We cannot support the planned crime of the century!"
"in writing. - The EU and Member States face one of their biggest challenges with regard to ensuring adequate and sustainable pension systems in Europe."
"Given that a large percentage of citizens are highly dependent on their pension schemes for their livelihood, I would like to emphasise the importance of the state-financed pension schemes based on the principle of solidarity."
"In multifaceted situations with various traditions and types of pension scheme, and given that the main responsibility for pension reform rests within the remit of Member States, it is impossible to apply the principle of one-size-fits-all."
"The EU can, however, add value by providing coordination between the various pension schemes and sharing best practice."
"Any review of pension systems should be carried out in a transparent way, protecting consumers' needs and informing citizens of their rights with regard to the various pension schemes and the risks involved, especially those related to cross-border mobility."
"Pension systems should be able to withstand any potential budgetary and demographic pressures on Member States without putting undue pressure on ordinary citizens."
"All this needs to be addressed through the prism of the demographic and socio-economic challenges of the future, such as the development of atypical employment, a growing female labour force, changes in family structures, and youth unemployment."
"Some of the subjects in the Commission's initiative on this Green Paper seem to me to be particularly important."
"I see it as our duty to prevent older citizens in particular, who have helped to build up our current levels of prosperity during their working lives, from ending up in a vulnerable situation in their old age."
"At the same time, the report takes proper account of the subsidiarity principle."
"The Commission should make a clearer call for equality between men and women."
"Women more often have atypical employment contracts than men."
"Their pensions are often smaller and, therefore, they are at greater risk of suffering poverty in old age."
"Appropriate and secure pension systems represent long-term intergenerational contracts."
"Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission to use the Green Paper to launch initiatives which generate greater public awareness of the solidarity between the generations on the subject of pension provision."
"I think that the EU needs to create an open unitary pension system which will take into account demographic trends and the issue of mobility."
"Let me give the example of my own country."
"In Romania, the annual expenditure on pensions is the largest category of budgetary expenditure."
"The state social insurance budget has recorded an annual deficit ever since 2006, reaching EUR 1.5 billion in 2009."
"According to the World Bank's estimates, in 2050, the deficit produced by pensions expenditure would have reached approximately 12% of GDP under the old system."
"This is why, by adopting Act no 263/2010, Romania has introduced a series of major reforms which will ensure the sustainability of the public pension system in the medium and long term."
"These reforms include: - discouraging early retirement and retirement through disability on unjustified medical grounds; - increasing the number of people contributing to the public unitary pension system; - gradually raising the normal retirement age for men and women, to 65 for men by 2015, and to 63 for women by 2030."
"All pensions at present are the responsibility of each Member State, but the EU also has a strong role to play in pension policy."
"For us to be able to achieve our objective, which is that the free movement of people and labour is genuinely free, pension systems must be adequately harmonised."
"A minimum level for pensions must also be guaranteed, so that families can actually move around completely freely."
"Accordingly, we need to move towards a harmonised system, and the sooner the better."
"Otherwise, a nonuniversal system of pensions will actually create a barrier to free movement within the EU."
"I was glad to learn that the report on the Commission's Green Paper on adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems would be added to today's agenda."
"The issue of future pensions, how safe they are, and what income they will provide is currently one of the most important problems facing society."
"Although the Member States are responsible for deciding on the shape to be taken by pension systems, and, in principle, the European Union is not authorised to take action in this area, certain legislative solutions relating to pension systems should be worked out at EU level."
"Parliament's demand that the Commission develop guidelines for the governments of the Member States is of great significance for the economic security of pensioners, since the guidelines would set minimum levels for pensions and criteria for calculating pension benefits, which would mean that women's pension benefits would no longer fall short of men's."
"Women are condemned to lower pensions than men through no fault of their own, due to being paid different amounts for the same work or to the need to interrupt their career to care for children, which results in lower contributions over their entire working life."
"In the face of threats to the stability of pension systems, the Commission should therefore not forget to ensure that legal solutions are introduced which guarantee the equal treatment of women and men throughout the EU as a whole as far as the level of future pensions is concerned."
"On reaching the horrific figure of 23 million unemployed, Europe in 2011 has beaten every negative record of the decade in the field of employment policies, thus officially branding them a failure."
"The crisis is more than sufficient grounds for adopting a text in which the appeal to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the area of pensions shows that the Eurocrats have become more reasonable again in revising a European social model that has certainly failed."
"After a decade of being sidelined, the governments are stepping in and becoming the main players in the rebuilding of social Europe."
"That is not enough, however: only a brave decision in favour of grassroots democracy, based on employment reforms that make work more attractive and on payslip federalism that takes account of the different costs of living in each region of Europe, against which both wages and pensions would be readjusted, would constitute a real change of direction towards renewal."
"Lowering the cost of labour by reducing taxes, and giving our small enterprises the chance to carry on working and investing in the region, are essential moves to ensure equalisation of contributions for the older generations and a future of certainty and quality of life for the new ones."
"Falsified medicinal products (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Matias, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source - C6-0513/2008 - 2008/0261 (COD))."
"Madam President, now that we have arrived at this point, at this time and at the end of this long process, I think that we know what it is that unites us, every man and woman in this room: it is the protection of patients' health."
"It is our duty to protect the 500 million citizens who live in Europe and who do not know if the medicines they are using are real or falsified."
"We have to give them the guarantee that the medicines they are using are going to help save their lives, and not contribute to their early death."
"I think that this problem is far too serious for us to allow it to continue unresolved any longer."
"That is why I have referred several times to these falsified medicines as 'silent killers' because that is effectively what they are, because if people who have problems ..."
"We know how falsification networks have changed: a few years ago everybody would be talking about Viagra, but today it is impossible not to talk about drugs that combat, or attempt to combat, diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and cholesterol."
"Therefore, as I said, these are 'silent killers' because, if they are not combating these diseases, they are not helping people."
"This commitment that we are discussing here today is one which brings together some of the changes obtained throughout this process."
"To begin with, we started in the market and ended up in health (and I heartily welcome this move to health); to begin with, we started with physical space, and included the Internet, as we could not leave out the main gateway for falsified medicines in Europe; to begin with, we had merely a monitoring system, and we went on to add sanctions and penalties to this."
"If we consider that falsification is a crime, we had to add sanctions and penalties."
"There is also another important element: this is not confined merely to Europe."
"We also ensure that third countries, where the situation of falsification is even more serious, are considered within our proposal presented here today."
"We know that, in spite of only having random monitoring, since 2005, there has been a 400% increase in the seizure of falsified medicines."
"We know that this trade represents profits of EUR 45 billion per year for certain criminal networks, but a total disaster for citizens' health."
"That is why I wish to make it very clear that the counterfeiting of medicines is not just any counterfeiting, because it is a form of counterfeiting which completely undermines confidence in our health systems."
"As falsification is an organised crime, as I have already mentioned, I believe that we have to combat it with this legislation, with our commitment, and with our concerted efforts."
"Therefore, we present a monitoring system which extends all the way from the manufacturer to the patient."
"This has been a battle for Parliament, and something which I am very pleased is now assured."
"This procedure has passed through two Commissioners and four presidencies."
"We began with the Commissioner for Industry, as I mentioned, and we end now with the Commissioner for Health."
"It has been a long process and therefore, I would like to end with some words of very special thanks for the rapporteurs from other groups who have followed this procedure with great commitment and dedication, from the beginning to the end: Mrs Grossetête, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mr Krahmer, Mr Tremopoulos, Mrs Yannakoudakis and Mrs Rosbach."
"Without them, this would not have been such an interesting and, at the same time, productive, debate."
"I know that at times, we have adopted differing stances, but I also know that we have had a common objective, that of protecting patients' health."
"As I cannot thank all those who have been involved, I would like to offer my symbolic gratitude to all those who worked on this directive by naming Mrs Pantazidou, who gave me immense support throughout the whole procedure."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address Parliament on this important issue of falsified medicines."
"The proposal before us today for an amending directive on falsified medicines will, subject to Parliament's approval, take us into new territory."
"A successful conclusion of this file will mark the first time that the European Union has tackled, with legislation, the specific threat of falsified pharmaceuticals."
"This text is going to make our regulatory system fit for the future; making a major contribution to protecting patients from the many dangers of fake medicines."
"As Members will know, falsified medicines are different from counterfeit products."
"Falsified medicines are about public health."
"I was very pleased that an early agreement on the substance of the proposal was reached between the colegislators just before Christmas."
"Let me thank all those who worked so hard to make this agreement possible, especially the rapporteur of the lead committee, Ms Matias, as well as the rapporteurs of the committees giving opinions, Ms Sartori and Ms Bastos."
"I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs."
"The Commission stands fully behind the substance of this well-balanced agreement, which introduces rigid and effective measures whilst being risk proportionate and flexible."
"This is crucial, as not all medicines are the same: the likeliness of falsification varies, as does the risk of public health."
"Turning to some of the specific issues, I would like to highlight the following."
"On safety features: we saw the risk that Member States might, in future, take divergent approaches on the packaging."
"This would have led to different levels of protection in the European Union."
"It would have led to a fragmentation of the European Union market for medicines."
"I am sure Members will share my satisfaction that we have paved the way towards a European safety feature to identify and thus authenticate a medicine."
"The Commission has always supported a European approach in this regard."
"On active pharmaceutical ingredients: the agreed text strengthens inspections and international cooperation in this field."
"The Commission and the network of European agencies will work more closely with international partners."
"Only through such cooperation can we achieve a truly effective system of inspection and enforcement."
"The legislation, once adopted, will increase the transparency of actors involved in the distribution of medicines."
"Finally, Parliament insisted on rules concerning online sales of medicines."
"I consider that Parliament found a strong, pragmatic solution by focusing on issues of transparency."
"The argument acknowledges that the rules for pharmacies in the EU vary but, in future, it will be easier for patients throughout the EU to distinguish legal operators from illegal online pharmacies."
"President, Members, I trust I can count on your full support as regards the next step in the legislative process towards finalising this worthy and much needed initiative."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Matias, and thanking everyone who collaborated with her."
"Sadly, over the last few years, we have witnessed an increase in the falsification of medicines here in Europe."
"According to European Union data, currently 1.5 million boxes of falsified medicines are sold every year via the legal supply chain."
"This is a criminal activity which represents a serious threat to European patients and industry."
"The purpose of this directive is to block the introduction of falsified medicines into the supply chain, and thereby protect public health."
"I would like to highlight the following key points in the opinion that I drafted: the introduction of a definition of falsified medicine, which clearly places the emphasis on consumer protection, the application of safety provisions to those medicines which are subject to medical prescription, the accountability of all participants in the supply chain and, finally, the application by Member States of effective sanctions to deter this criminal activity."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Grossetête, on the good work she has accomplished."
"Falsified medicinal products are dangerous because of their huge public health impact, not to mention their economic impact."
"Although the compromise text is a decided improvement over the provisions of the 2001 directive, it does not touch on certain issues that I think are fundamental, which I would like to mention here."
"Manufacturers of active substances based in third countries should be subject to inspections by the Member State to which those substances are destined, to be mediated by the competent authorities of the third country in question."
"Medicinal products should be clearly traceable as regards the manufacturer and the country of origin of the various active substances whenever this information is not specified in the new formulation."
"The issue of Internet sales remains unresolved."
"Nonetheless, I would stress that the report is positive overall and makes improvements, and I support Mrs Grossetête in favour of the compromise."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Matias, on her work."
"I would also like to congratulate the Council and the Commission, since we have finally reached agreement on this extremely important directive on combating organised crime linked to falsified medicines."
"The numbers are too high: 34 million falsified medicinal products seized in the European Union in 2008, a massive increase of 380%."
"Over 50% of medicines sold over the Internet are falsified, representing a real menace to all our fellow citizens."
"The directive represents a step forward."
"I see it as just a step, because unfortunately, we have not gone far enough."
"We should have moved faster."
"However, it is a step forward, with stricter inspections for the manufacturers of active ingredients constituting a particularly valuable feature."
"We are seeking to improve safety and that means we need to identify the responsibilities of each player in the supply chain: manufacturers, wholesalers, parallel importers, brokers and distributors."
"In the interests of safety, we also need to ensure that every box of prescription medicine is traceable."
"I would have liked the proposal to go further on this front."
"In addition to guaranteeing authenticity by having a unique code for each package, the safety requirements also include rules on tamper-proof packaging for boxes that are handled by parallel importers."
"We have had lengthy discussions on this matter. It is an important point because we are currently dealing with a real scourge that has ramifications for public health."
"Pharmacists also need access to trustworthy supplies of quality products."
"I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that we need to remain vigilant as we put all of these safety requirements into practice."
"Yet I do not think our work ends there."
"We will need to monitor carefully how this directive is implemented."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can all imagine the nightmare."
"Someone we know is ill and in a desperate situation."
"They are given medicines, but the medicines have no effect, because they have been falsified."
"We are grateful to the Commission for producing this proposal."
"It is true that we have been discussing it for some time."
"We began our debates in the previous parliamentary term and I would like to thank Mr Adamou, who is no longer a Member of this Parliament, for the preliminary work that he did on behalf of Mrs Matias."
"I believe that we have reached a good compromise, as Mrs Grossetête has said."
"Yes, we could have gone further."
"We are all impatient and we all want greater safety, but this is a good compromise."
"What have we achieved?"
"We have made patient safety the central feature of the legislation."
"The safety measures that we have put in place will ensure that products are traceable throughout the entire distribution chain."
"Medicines can be traced from the manufacturer to the pharmacist."
"They will have an identifier which makes it immediately obvious if they are falsified or duplicated or if there are any irregularities, which can then be followed up."
"We have deliberately done this in such a way that the costs of the system remain at a reasonable level for everyone involved and that the system is not excessive."
"However, we are also not compromising on patient safety."
"This traceability is accompanied by the fact that the packaging must be undamaged, so that a patient who is given a pack can see that it has not been opened because it has an intact seal."
"In addition, there will be no more packs of medicines which are divided in two, as frequently used to be the case."
"All of this will improve safety levels and increase patients' confidence."
"What else have we achieved?"
"We have implemented an early warning system."
"This is excellent because it is the same system which has been in place for decades for foods and which we take for granted."
"There is an early warning system throughout the European Union for contaminated food."
"It is hard to believe that we have not had the same thing for medicines."
"If a falsified medicine is discovered, it is now possible to send out an early warning."
"The Member States must identify the patients who are affected, inform everyone involved and make sure that the risk involved in a medicine which is in circulation is made public."
"We take this for granted in the case of cars and food, but it has not been available so far for something as essential as medicines."
"As far as the Internet is concerned, anyone who accesses an illegal website must be able to recognise that it is illegal."
"This is why we must certify legal websites which, in future, will have a link to the website of the national approval body."
"They will be able to display a logo which will be developed by the European Commission."
"Everyone who buys medicines on the Internet can do so independently."
"They can tell whether they are dealing with a safe, legal website or an illegal one."
"All of this is a milestone, a quantum leap forward in patient safety."
"If we adopt this legislation tomorrow, we can be proud of what we have done and we should also make our achievements clear to the general public."
"Madam President, Europe is rightly regarded as having the safest medicines in the world."
"With this legislation, which we have been discussing for a long time, for two years I believe, we will further improve levels of safety."
"I would like to thank Mrs Matias very much for taking on such a complex report as a new Member of Parliament."
"This was a huge task and she has done very well."
"It also involved a great deal of teamwork and I would like to thank everyone involved for this."
"We have produced some very good results."
"However, we must not lose sight of the fact that we can never achieve complete safety by means of regulations."
"This is true in every area, not just in the case of medicines."
"We have rightly concentrated on the essential issues, on the distinctions between different types of packaging and on traceability in the distribution chain."
"By differentiating between prescription and over-the-counter medicines, we are taking the right approach, because we must remember that every piece of legislation and every attempt to make products safer costs money."
"Therefore, it is reasonable not to include every pack of aspirins or every over-the-counter medicine automatically right from the start."
"Instead, the Commission or the agency must be given the task of monitoring the market and investigating developments."
"I believe that we can be proud of what we have achieved."
"We have produced a piece of legislation that brings real benefits."
"Most patients will probably not be aware that they are the result of EU law and, therefore, we must make this very clear."
"Madam President, tomorrow, we shall be voting on this revised directive to combat the risk of millions of falsified medicinal products entering the legal supply chain, precisely because we want to protect public health from this silent killer."
"The basic issue is that we need to establish a mandatory safety feature for prescription medicinal products, under certain circumstances, and for non-prescription medicinal products at risk of falsification, based on certain risk-assessment criteria, together with strict controls of online sales via authorised Internet pharmacies which display the EU logo."
"Following exhaustive dialogue with the Council and the Commission, we have agreed on numerous points in the compromise text."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are in favour of extending the scope to all medicinal products at risk of falsification and of stricter regulation of online sales."
"I am delighted that these issues have been satisfactorily resolved in the final agreement with the Council."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"When we look at medicine in today's global markets, we see that there are no borders."
"Therefore, we have no option but to deal with the issue of counterfeit medicine in a global manner."
"Only by a united EU approach can we tackle the increasing counterfeit products available to the public - available not only through the shop floor, but via distribution services such as the Internet."
"The directive presses all the right buttons and goes some way towards addressing the problem."
"Could we have gone further?"
"The answer is yes."
"Should we have gone further?"
"Here I must say no. We have laid down tighter controls on prescription medicine as a first step."
"We have addressed the Internet pharmacy issue."
"We have looked at the safety features."
"Yes, we could have gone further on the traceability, taking it up to the patient, but this is a battle that we would have lost and it would have delayed the directive."
"As they say, Rome was not built in a day."
"I look forward to building on the foundations of this directive."
"Madam President, unfortunately, we are seeing more and more falsified medicinal products on the market in our Member States."
"That is why this proposal is so important."
"Patients in the EU need to know how they can avoid falsified medicinal products."
"They are also entitled to see that we, as legislators, are fighting to combat these products."
"It is important that we adopt clear definitions."
"All too often, we adopt legislation that is imprecise and unclear."
"This must not happen in such an important case as this."
"Medicinal products must be checked before they come onto the market and not only after patients have, in fact, been acting as guinea pigs for several years."
"We must satisfy ourselves that medicinal products are only imported if safety and the possibility of verification are given top priority."
"Falsification of medicinal products harms both the patients and the pharmaceutical companies in the Member States."
"I therefore hope that we can agree on a more stringent line than that proposed by the Commission, and I would like to thank Mrs Matias for her sterling work."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Matias."
"My thanks go also to Mrs Grossetête, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"The two of them have done excellent groundwork on this directive during the last parliamentary term."
"The falsification of medicines is a growing problem."
"The number of cases identified amounted to 7.5 million in 2009, which is many more than in previous years."
"These are only those cases that have come to light."
"There is a large number of unreported incidents, which is why we can only assume that the problem is a major one."
"It is very irritating if lifestyle medicines are found to contain no active ingredients."
"However, if essential medicines used to treat cancer, for example, contain no active ingredients, the wrong ingredients or the wrong dosage, this can put patients' lives at risk."
"This is why action was urgently needed."
"We have taken a reasonable approach."
"The subject of data protection is a highly sensitive one and we have found the right balance."
"We are acting on the basis of the risks involved and focusing initially on prescription medicines."
"There is an opt-out procedure available, if there is reason to assume that there is no risk."
"There is also an opt-in process for over-the-counter medicines, if there is reason to assume that they have been falsified."
"Overall, this is a very good compromise and I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved."
"(NL) Madam President, thank you, Mrs Matias, for an excellent piece of work and for the good cooperation."
"I believe that this is a very important scheme for the health of consumers, although up until now, they have probably not even been aware that their health has been at risk."
"Fortunately, at least we have finally got round to tackling all the risks now."
"People's health should not be trifled with."
"Indeed, I believe that, with this scheme, we are taking an important step towards making packaging safe and towards clarifying the situation."
"I am also very pleased that, at Parliament's insistence, the sale of medicines via the Internet has been included in the directive, because that was a thorn in everybody's side."
"If you view this situation as gambling with the health of consumers, then Internet sales are tantamount to Russian roulette."
"You have a 50 to 90% chance of encountering a counterfeit medicine, and then - bang!"
"I am very pleased that this scheme has addressed that issue."
"I do think, however, that some further modifications are needed, because we do not yet have cast-iron guarantees of safety."
"I suppose that is up to each individual Member State."
"Moreover, there is also the issue of the logo, of whether it will be entirely tamper-proof on the Internet, so we really have to keep an eye on this aspect."
"Transparency and reliability for consumers;"
"I hope that consumers can take a punt on medicines without gambling with their health."
"Madam President, let me first congratulate Marisa and my colleagues for reaching an agreement with the Council on such a complex dossier."
"The text now on the table reinforces the security of our legal chain of supply for medicinal products, but let me emphasise that only 1% of falsified medicines reach our patients via this legal chain."
"The other 99% comes from illegal channels and the black market."
"In this regard, I very much welcome the additional provisions focusing on the Internet put forward by the European Parliament."
"But in order to address this major risk for patients' safety, we must also reinforce EU actions in the field of justice, police and customs cooperation."
"The Commission should go further in this field and we insist on this to combat falsified medicines properly."
"Regarding the specific provisions of the agreement to be voted on tomorrow, and most particularly the new safety features to be implemented, I would like to ask the Commission to clearly monitor the impact of this directive."
"In its initial report, the Committee on the Environment stated that the measures put in place should respond to three guiding principles: proportionality, cost-effectiveness and independence."
"(CS) Madam President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work."
"We all know that the pharmaceutical industry is very big business."
"It is said to be the third largest in the world, after drugs and weapons."
"It therefore offers rich pickings, and some people will always try to grab these by illegal means."
"We will never be able to prevent the production of fake medicines."
"Our task is to minimise the risk that they will get on to the European market and that they will reach our citizens."
"We know that when someone sells a counterfeit watch, that is an infringement of intellectual property protection, but when a counterfeit medicine is sold, it is a direct health risk."
"It is this fact which has led us and is leading us to support this report."
"We know we cannot solve everything, and we know there is a problem, for example, over the fact that packaging is often produced separately from medicines, and that counterfeit medicines in genuine packaging are in circulation around the world."
"However, this is a step in the right direction and an attempt at the maximum possible protection."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the Commission's proposed changes to the directive on medicinal products for human use are designed to help prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, we would have expected more concrete results, particularly through the introduction of compulsory inspections of production sites in which active substances are manufactured in third countries."
"That option was rejected on the grounds that such checks would be too costly."
"The fact is that European companies have to meet extremely high quality standards, whereas companies manufacturing in other parts of the world do not."
"We are voting in favour, however, since measures are being introduced to make sure that imported pharmaceutical products are safer, including traceability, a ban on repackaging, compliance with EU safety standards, the partial regulation of Internet sales, and the possibility of extending similar measures to over-the-counter medicinal products as well."
"(PL) Madam President, according to the World Health Organisation, around 10% of the global pharmaceutical market is accounted for by counterfeit medicinal products."
"It is hard to estimate the exact scale of the problem in the individual Member States of the European Union, but in Poland in 2009 alone, for example, customs officers confiscated over 100 000 falsified products."
"Apart from falsified medicines, the problems which patients face include a lack of reliable information on the contents of packaging, and also the issue of repackaging, during which the contents may change."
"It is also very important for patients to be able to obtain reliable information on the Internet."
"Unfortunately, as well as much information which is genuine, there is a lot of information on the Internet which is false."
"Against this background, it is important to introduce a system for monitoring and checking medicines, which will provide patients with reliable information."
"We are aware, however, that even the best regulations will not bring about the anticipated effect if they include no provisions for appropriate penalties for entities which put counterfeit medicines into circulation."
"Today's debate is therefore extremely important, as is the introduction of regulations which not only prevent the distribution of counterfeit medicines and put in place a monitoring system, but which, above all, impose penalties on the manufacturers of fakes."
"Numbers of counterfeit medicinal products will only be reduced and their use made safer if measures of this kind are taken."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Matias, on a good report."
"I am aware that it will not solve every problem, but it is a major step towards increasing patient safety."
"Colleagues, just to say that you are all doing well in keeping to your speaking time, but you are stretching our interpreters' capacities by speaking very fast."
"Could we try and find a happy medium, please."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, in the light of this text, allow me to express my satisfaction and to emphasise one requirement and one point on which we will need to be vigilant."
"I am pleased that we have succeeded in extending the legal basis for this directive from the original single market remit to cover public health too."
"We have a requirement: we have fought to ensure that online sales form an integral part of this directive so as to be able to create checks and controls that reflect our findings."
"There is also one point on which we will need to be vigilant."
"We know that falsified medicinal products make up 1% to 3% of the market in developed countries, between 10% and 30% in Asia and Latin America, and up to 70% in some African countries."
"Some studies suggest that trafficking falsified medicines can be 25 times more profitable than drug trafficking."
"To summarise: we have successfully established one requirement and one point on which we need to remain vigilant if we are to continue to develop greater international cooperation, which, in turn, will allow the European Union to take the lead in the fight against the blight of falsified medicinal products."
"I would like to thank Mrs Matias for her work and also our group's rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who always provides valuable input in this field."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Dalli, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs who have done an excellent job."
"Initially, we had a very heated discussion on this subject."
"However, the MEDI-FAKE action in December 2008 may have had an impact in this area."
"During the course of two months, 34 million falsified tablets were seized on the European Union's external borders."
"This was a warning which prompted us to speed up our work."
"We have now produced results that we can be really satisfied with. We have guaranteed the traceability of medicines."
"Every pharmacist can identify using a scanner whether a product is falsified or genuine."
"However, I would like to make one request."
"It is true that websites are now being monitored and that they have a logo, although this can also be forged, but in the case of sales over the Internet, we need to do some public relations work to explain the risks of Internet purchases to the citizens of Europe."
"I am very pleased that parallel trade has been retained."
"It has a worse reputation than it actually deserves and its position has been guaranteed."
"I would like to make one final point."
"We should perhaps consider, for the safety of citizens and to improve understanding, whether it would be a good idea to deal with the problem of widely differing pack sizes in different countries in order to introduce a standardised solution."
"(CS) Madam President, for two years, we have been discussing the alarming growth in counterfeit medicines on our market, including lifesaving medicines."
"The result is a good directive which tightens up controls both on distributors and retailers, introducing mandatory protective measures and checks against infringement."
"Producers will also assess risks in respect of processing aids, all of which has been happening for years in the Czech Republic, for example."
"It is therefore excellent that this will apply throughout the EU."
"There is also a need for the system not to be restricted just to prescription medicines."
"If we wish to avoid losing our fight against counterfeits, Member States must achieve a greater level of integration in the area of health, unite in banning websites offering counterfeits and introduce inspections at third country producers, as is the case already with imported foods."
"After all, in China alone, there are 500 factories for counterfeit medicines."
"We simply have to step on the gas if we want to enhance safety on the European market."
"(SV) Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli, the rapporteur, Mrs Matias, and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work on an important matter, because falsified medicinal products clearly represent a serious threat to patients' health."
"What is particularly serious is the fact that the number of falsifications of life-saving medicines is increasing."
"These are medicines for the treatment of cancer, heart disease and infections, in other words, situations where someone really is in need of an effective medicine."
"We are now taking a major step forward with regard to medicinal products within the EU, but the problem extends beyond the EU's borders."
"According to the WHO's expert group, many countries in Africa, parts of Asia and Latin America have areas where more than 30% of the medicines on sale may be falsified."
"It is therefore extremely important for cooperation with third countries to be strengthened, and hopefully the changes that we are now implementing within the EU will also have an impact on the countries outside our Union."
"Madam President, fake medicines, as we have heard, are an increasing problem."
"Customs officials stopped 32 million counterfeit medicinal products from entering the EU in 2008."
"The WHO estimates that 50% of drugs supplied over the Internet are falsified and there are even cases when the legitimate supply chain has been infiltrated."
"For example, between 2005 and 2007 in the UK, there were a number of cases reported by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of fake lifesaving products, such as AstraZeneca's prostrate cancer drug, Casodex, and the antiplatelet drug, Plavix, which protects against heart attack and stroke, actually reaching wholesalers and even pharmacy shelves."
"That is why we urgently need to tighten the rules on import, export and trade in fake medicines."
"I very much support this regulation."
"(PT) Madam President, the problem of falsified medicines obviously poses a serious threat to public health, whether these are prescribed drugs or over-the-counter products."
"Without prejudice to the adoption of some important measures proposed in this report, I wish here to draw attention to an essential element of this problem."
"As with other illicit activities, medicines are falsified because there are economic factors which stimulate that activity."
"Therefore, we have to attack the root causes which make medicines big business: one of the biggest businesses on a world scale."
"We have to promote the strengthening of public policies in this area; we have to reinforce public capacity in the field of research and development of new drugs, attacking the monopoly of the pharmaceutical industry and its disastrous consequences in terms of access to medication; and we also have to strengthen public capacity in the areas of production, supervision and monitoring of medicines."
"(SK) Madam President, I would like to support the submitted bill, which amends and adds to the directive from 2001 on preventing counterfeit medicines from entering the legal supply chain."
"The dramatically worsening situation on the market, where the quantity of fake medicines in legal circulation has recently risen sharply, requires a thorough tightening up of rules on monitoring, as well as sanctions."
"The situation is all the more serious for the fact that counterfeiters, in a scramble to maximise profits, are progressing from fake dietary supplements to fake lifesaving medicines used for treating infections, heart disorders and cancer."
"Such counterfeits can have fatal consequences for patients, who may be quite unaware that they have become victims of fraud, and that the tablets they are using are only imitation medicines and will not cure them at all."
"It is therefore our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to stand up to this dirty business affecting the lives and health of our citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very pleased to be part of this positive movement and this very interesting discussion."
"This, in fact, is the second pillar of the Pharma package that we are delivering and the third pillar, that of information to patients, has already had a very good report here in Parliament."
"I hope that we will be pushing this quite aggressively during the coming months."
"As you have said, and I agree, the emphasis is on protection of consumers."
"This is what the division should be in actions like the one we are taking today."
"A lot of work has been done."
"A lot of work still needs to be done to develop the details to make this directive operational."
"But even after that, we cannot rest on our laurels, happy that we have a nice piece of legislation that has a lot of technical details that are very avant-garde."
"We have to inform our citizens of what it means, and how they can utilise the tools that we are giving them with this directive so that they do not succumb to the pitfall of being drawn into purchasing falsified medicines."
"We will do everything in our power to ensure proper traceability."
"Inspections in third countries are important."
"We have to realise, however, that, for example, 80% of the ingredients that we use in what we produce in the European pharma industry come from third countries."
"Therefore, we have to be pragmatic."
"We also have to be selective in the type of inspections that we do."
"There are third countries that have very high levels of inspection and standards and we naturally have to cooperate with these countries to ensure that these standards are being kept to."
"In other countries that are not as proficient as these, we have to go and see with our own eyes and touch with our own hands."
"This is the policy we have to push forward."
"I am looking forward to working with Parliament in the next phases to make this work."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, obviously, I would like to thank my fellow Members for all the comments they have made."
"I am not going to mention them one by one, as this is not my intention."
"I think that if any doubts existed as to the meaning of the word commitment, it has become very clear here what it means."
"We do not all have perfect proposals, but more important than knowing whether a proposal is perfect is knowing that we have an instrument in our hands which will allow us not to have to put off the protection of our patients' health any longer."
"We are also bound not to delay its adaptation; we are bound not to delay putting it into action; and we can only do this if we work together."
"I must also say personally - and the Commissioner mentioned the issue of inspections - that in my initial proposal, I presented a change to mandatory inspections in third countries."
"This is our commitment and yet we win in some areas and we lose in others."
"The Commission explained to us that this would be impossible to achieve."
"I would like to mention something else with regard to this commitment."
"I think that we all see ourselves as being committed, but I also think and am aware that we must all demand that it is honoured because, otherwise, it will not be effective."
"This commitment contains guaranteed safeguards to ensure that we can follow the procedure, assess it and have systematic access to information which will allow us to verify whether or not it is being put into practice as it should be, and whether it is necessary to make some changes."
"I would therefore like to end by thanking the European Commission for its collaboration and, in particular, the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies with whom we have been working over the last six months."
"There is no such thing as a perfect proposal, no such thing as a perfect action; there will always be flaws, but I think we have a strong and robust commitment which will allow us to fight for and defend patients' health."
"As my own speech is also full of flaws, I failed to thank my fellow Members, Mrs Bastos and Mrs Sartori, for the opinions of the other committees."
"Thank you also for your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at midday tomorrow (Wednesday, 16 February 2011)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Falsified medicinal products and the illegal trade in medicines are worldwide problems, both for highly developed countries and developing countries, and the problem is becoming increasingly widespread, posing a threat to patients' safety and lives."
"One of the reasons for this is that falsified medicinal products and drugs sold in places not authorised to sell them do not meet the quality requirements set for medicinal products, and contain prohibited substances whose use may have unknown consequences."
"I agree that the problem requires effective and strengthened international coordination and cooperation in order to guarantee an effective strategy for combating falsified medicines."
"I fully support the proposal that measures should be taken with the aim of minimising the problem of trade in falsified medicinal products, and also of trade in medicines sold in places not authorised to sell them and other falsified products fulfilling the criteria for medicinal products."
"Attention should be paid to the need to regulate mail-order and Internet sales of medicinal products."
"According to information from the World Health Organisation, falsified medicines account for around 50% of products offered on the Internet."
"I believe that it is essential to plan and implement measures aimed at making information available on falsified medicinal products and medicines from illegal sources, and to run public education campaigns regarding the threats associated with purchasing medicinal products in places not authorised to sell them."
"I also believe that it would be a reasonable idea to put in place safeguards making it possible to identify medicinal products and to verify their authenticity and traceability."
"Falsified medicinal products are a global problem, and should be examined in a global context."
"The reasons behind the problem include the high price of medicines and a lack of awareness among patients, but to a large extent, they are also of a legal nature."
"This situation is exploited by criminal groups throughout the world."
"I would therefore like to acknowledge the joint measures taken by the EU institutions and the almost unanimous position adopted by all the political groups on the drafting of a compromise legislative act on this matter."
"I wish to quote a statement by the former Secretary-General of Interpol, Ronald Noble, comparing the number of victims of terrorism and counterfeit medicines: over a period of 45 years, terrorists killed 65 000 people, whereas counterfeit medicines claimed 200 000 victims in China alone."
"I believe that monitoring, control measures, tightening up standards and establishing a mutual recognition system, all of which are emphasised, are good solutions from which to begin."
"As Vice-Chair of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would also like to highlight the role played by information campaigns aimed at patients, and also the imposition of obligations on pharmaceutical companies in this area."
"Patients should have access to high quality, objective information regarding the way in which medicines are prescribed and their properties."
"Falsified medicinal products make up 50% of medicines sold over the Internet and 1% to 3% of medicines sold by dispensing pharmacists."
"These falsified products are evolving: they now include life-saving medicines as well as lifestyle medicines."
"We have a duty to protect the health of our fellow citizens who choose to order medicines online in order to save time or money, unaware of the risks that they are running."
"What is more, these falsified medicines are entering the formal supply chain and finding their way into dispensing chemists' stocks, where they could prove deadly to any one of us."
"Every year, 200 000 people lose their lives after ingesting falsified medicinal products."
"This is more than just a worrying trend: we need to fight this scourge with all the means at our disposal."
"For this reason, I welcome the forthcoming adoption of the directive, which will introduce a unique track and trace code to prove that medicinal products are authentic, together with a standard logo to identify trustworthy websites selling pharmaceutical products."
"However, I would like to stress that providing this safety, to which patients are entitled, must not be used as a justification for price increases."
"The pharmaceutical industry is one of the three most lucrative industries."
"It is certainly one of the main reasons why counterfeit pharmaceuticals are spreading on to the market."
"Last year, customs confiscated 384% more counterfeit pharmaceuticals than were confiscated five years ago."
"In combating this phenomenon, it is very important to accept unified security measures within the European Union, including repackaging."
"Patients need to have complete confidence that any medication they are taking is indeed what they think it is and that the active ingredient in the prescription corresponds to what is in the medication."
"From the perspective of national health, it is of the utmost importance that the medication should be effective, high quality and safe."
"False information campaigns by third-party pharmaceutical companies that have procured a licence to sell from competent institutions must be prohibited."
"This prohibition should also be extended to information and advertising distributed to medical staff."
"It is essential to protect the pharmaceutical supply chain against the entry of falsified medicinal products for the sake of the general public and companies that operate correctly and responsibly."
"The directive being examined by Parliament must therefore be supported wholeheartedly, since it introduces procedures and obligations that I hope can lead to concrete and effective results."
"In particular, I would like to underline the importance of certain obligations placed on a range of actors involved in the supply chain, from distributors to wholesalers, and, above all, the introduction of 'safety features' on prescription medicinal products with the aim of assuring consumers of the integrity of the manufacturing and supply chain."
"Stricter rules on inspections, on the traceability of the substances contained in medicinal products, as well as on online sales, are further measures that I think will curb the trade in falsified medicinal products."
"It should be noted, however, that the compromise text establishes that there will be regular inspections at production sites in third countries, but that they will be carried out by the authorities of the third country in question."
"It would have been better if they were to be performed by the authorities of the countries to which the medicinal products are destined, because the main threat of falsification comes precisely from third countries."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0009/2011)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Subject: Marketing ban on the drug 'Médiator'"
"Can the Commission explain why a decision was not taken in 1998 to ban the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing benfluorex?"
"Should the Commission not have been alerted, and not for the first time, by the bans imposed by the authorities in Spain and Italy?"
"Why, ultimately, did the Commission not act until as late as June 2010, when it finally took a clear decision on the marketing of that molecule?"
"Will the Commission ask the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this drug was used over twenty years?"
"Member of the Commission. - Allow me to address each of the four component questions in turn."
"The first question was: can the Commission explain why a decision was not taken in 1998 to ban the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing benfluorex?"
"The answer: benfluorex was discussed in 1998 in the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, now called the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use, of the European Medicines Agency, and subsequently in the Pharmacovigilance Working Party."
"The committee considered that benfluorex should not be included in the scope of an ongoing evaluation procedure at European level, concerning certain anorectic agents due to a different mode of action."
"However, it was agreed that the committee's pharmacovigilance working party would investigate if there was a safety issue with this compound."
"In March 1999, the pharmacovigilance working party concluded that there were no major benefit-risk concerns for medicinal products containing benfluorex."
"Further discussion in the working party did not lead to changes in this conclusion."
"The second question: should the Commission not have been alerted and not first by the bans imposed by the authorities in Spain and Italy?"
"The answer: Italy and Spain did not revoke the marketing authorisation for benfluorex."
"In fact, the first time that a Member State effectively took measures to revoke the national marketing authorisation for Mediator was in 2009, when France suspended its national marketing authorisation."
"In Spain, it was the marketing authorisation holder, Servier, that withdrew the marketing authorisation in 2003."
"Similarly, it was Servier itself that did not request the renewal of the marketing authorisation in 2003 in Italy."
"The product remained authorised in France, Portugal, Luxembourg and Greece."
"Benfluorex was discussed within the pharmacovigilance working party, acting in its role as a forum for Member States to exchange pharmacovigilance data among themselves."
"I would like to clarify that monitoring of pharmacovigilance data and the subsequent decision making on national authorisations for medicinal products is the primary responsibility of Member States."
"Commission intervention in these cases is exceptional and limited to concrete situations foreseen in the legislation."
"The Commission can launch a Europe-wide evaluation by the European Medicines Agency in two cases: firstly, when Member States adopt divergent national decisions concerning a marketing authorisation and, secondly, before any decision is reached on the granting, variation, suspension or revocation of a marketing authorisation that appears necessary, in particular, when taking account of pharmacovigilance information in cases where it considers that the interests of the Community are involved."
"In this case, no action was triggered at EU level in the light of the conclusions of the pharmacovigilance working party and the fact that no divergent decisions were taken at the time by the Member States in response to the discussions in the working party."
"The third question was: why did the Commission not act until as late as June 2010 when it finally took a clear decision on the marketing of that molecule?"
"The answer: it was only in 2009 that a Member State, namely France, suspended the marketing authorisation of Mediator."
"Under the new provisions in place since 2004, this automatically triggered a review of the product's benefit-risk balance, which led to the adoption of a Commission decision requiring all Member States to revoke any national authorisations for benfluorex containing medicinal products."
"In this context, it is important to stress that the new pharmacovigilance legislation adopted on 15 December 2010 introduced additional provisions to ensure signal detection by the European Medicines Agency of safety issues for nationally-authorised products and creates new procedures at EU level to assess safety signals for such products, leading to harmonised actions by the Member States."
"The fourth and last question was: will the Commission ask the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this drug was used over 20 years?"
"The answer: to date, the Commission has not asked the European Medicines Agency to conduct a full retrospective investigation into the ways in which this medicinal product was used over 20 years."
"The figures and the documentation referred to in the French report clearly indicate that by far the highest use of this medicinal product was in France."
"I would just like to make it clear how I will deal with the supplementary questions this evening."
"I will take all the supplementaries together - remember that you have 30 seconds for the supplementary - and then I will ask the Commissioners to answer all the supplementaries en masse."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to raise one more point in the light of the comments made and the responses given by Commissioner Dalli, whom I would like to thank for the clarifications provided."
"As you pointed out, Commissioner, in 2003 and 2005, it was Servier which asked for the product to be withdrawn from sale in these two countries."
"You also said that in 1998 and 1999, the working party chose neither to authorise nor propose the withdrawal of this product."
"Yet we know that the medicinal product was withdrawn in the United States in 1997."
"Therefore, surely it is clear - and here is the nub of the matter - that in a market as large as the European Union, which encompasses 500 million European citizens, we need more vigilance?"
"In particular, we need additional alerts that will trigger Europe-wide action, with clear competences for the European Commission and the European Medicines Agency."
"In this way, we will be able to avoid a repeat of the situations that have occurred in some Member States, such as the French case that was cited."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, let us extend the terms of this debate, because the Mediator product is simply the visible tip of the iceberg and raises a range of other questions."
"For example, how is it that a medicinal product that is considered to be potentially harmful, even fatal, and that has been withdrawn from the market in some Member States, can continue to circulate freely within the European Union?"
"Should we not give serious thought to the role and the effectiveness of the European Medicines Agency, if its findings are not binding for Member States?"
"Member of the Commission. - In effect, the procedures that were in force at the time of the historic events that I recounted in my answer were as I stated: there was a clear separation between Member States and the European authority - a separation that is still, in fact, in force and jealously guarded by Member States."
"In effect, that is why, over time, we feel that we should be strengthening our pharmacovigilance processes and procedures."
"I must say that, in 2004, a step forward was taken on revising the pharmacovigilance procedures and processes that we already have, and also in the last pharmacovigilance agreement."
"We now have a lot of 'stoppers' and it is now also possible for other action to be taken at European level, too, to ensure that anything that is withdrawn from any market is notified and action can be taken upon it."
"This was not the case before."
"So this is the situation today."
"I have instructed my services to conduct a stress test now, including on the new pharmacovigilance processes and procedures put in place after our last agreement."
"They are taking Médiator as a case study to see whether something like Médiator could still happen with the latest pharmacovigilance processes."
"We will make sure that if we do find any vacuums, bottlenecks or spaces where action will not be taken in these cases, we will come back to you and try to correct the situation."
"Subject: Sale of iPad subscriptions by Apple"
"iPad producer Apple is demanding that newspaper and magazine publishers offer their readers their products (casual sales as well as subscriptions) exclusively via Apple's iTunes online store, so that it retains control of the sale conditions."
"This means that iPad users can no longer order any newspaper or magazine for iPad via the website of the publishers concerned."
"Does the Commission regard this action as compatible with EU law and such principles as interoperability and an open Internet?"
"Could this be a case of abuse of a dominant position and therefore infringement of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?"
"What action will the Commission be taking in this connection?"
"Member of the Commission. - Apple announced today that it will offer digital subscriptions to newspapers and magazines on iPad devices exclusively through applications (Apps) sold via its online store."
"Publishers will still be able to offer online subscriptions through their websites, or by other means, but they will no longer be able to process the subscription via an App on an iPhone using Apple as an intermediary."
"Whether Apple's behaviour constitutes a violation of the EU competition rules depends on a range of factual, legal and economic elements."
"It requires, inter alia, that Apple holds a dominant position in the relevant market."
"The boundaries of such relevant markets are not clear, as the sector is still relatively new and evolving and as there are also several comparable platforms and devices that provide similar functionalities, some of which are supported by online application stores as the consumer demand for electronic and/or print magazines is unclear and evolving."
"Once the market has been properly identified, the question of dominance would have to be assessed."
"Dominance has been defined by the European Court of Justice as a position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to hinder the maintenance of effective competition on the relevant market by allowing it to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors and customers and ultimately, of consumers."
"The Commission notes, in particular, that alternative application platforms exist and several companies have recently launched, or are expecting to launch in the near future, a number of devices similar in terms of functionality to the iPad."
"The Commission is following the developments regarding Apple's commercial policies and is in close contact with the national competition authorities."
"(NL) Madam President, this afternoon, Apple indeed announced that it wants to offer a new model to its subscribers, but it is clear that it wants to take advantage of its market position, no matter whether it is in the dominant market position or not, in order to get its hands on customer information which is at the disposal of publishers."
"In the long term, this could be particularly detrimental to publishers in Europe, as well as to media pluralism."
"I would therefore like to ask you whether you are prepared to act, regardless of whether or not this is a case of dominant position, and when you are going to take the initiative, if at all."
"In other words, could you explain what timescale you have in mind for this?"
"Is the Commission taking the initiative going to be a question of weeks or a question of months?"
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your answer but, in my opinion, you failed to mention an issue of fundamental importance, namely, whether we are capable of imagining at all what portion of the European market could be dominated by Apple's new product."
"You responded in a rather general fashion, by stating that the matter was only being examined at present."
"However, I think that we should know whether there is, in fact, a real threat that Apple will become dominant on the European market."
"Member of the Commission. - It remains to be seen whether Apple will become dominant in the market, because the market is evolving."
"We need to assess what the market is and what a dominant position means in this market."
"As far as market scale goes, at this stage, this is small, and it is premature to speak about any action by the Commission."
"If there are lots of competitive proposals and an Apple approach does not constitute a dominant position, then there is no need for the Commission to take action."
"As I said, the Commission is monitoring the situation according to the rules of EU competition law, and if there is a need for steps to be taken, they will be taken independently when the moment is right, when we conclude that action needs to be taken."
"So rest assured that action will be taken, if necessary."
"Subject: Protection of investments in the context of EU-Russia negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement"
"Does the Commission raise issues relating to investment protection, especially in the energy sector, in its negotiations with the Russian Federation on the new partnership and cooperation agreement?"
"Drawing on a number of cases when European energy companies were forced out of the Russian market without the possibility to seek impartial and fair local judicial protection, does the Commission intend to include an investor-to-state dispute settlement mechanism in the new partnership agreement or additional economic agreements with the Russian Federation?"
"What is the position of the Commission with regard to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT)?"
"Is the Commission still hopeful that the Russian Government might again sign the ECT and eventually ratify it?"
"Or will similar provisions relating to the protection of investments in the energy sector be included in the new partnership agreement?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, with a total stock of EUR 92 billion of foreign investment at the end of 2008, the European Union is by far the largest foreign investor in the Russian Federation."
"With regard to the energy sector, it is the EU's firm intention to ensure that the key principles enshrined in the Energy Charter Treaty will also be part of the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and the Russian Federation on the new treaty."
"The relevant provisions should include investment protection for the energy sector and, in particular, a strong dispute settlement mechanism."
"This approach would be without prejudice to the EU general assessment that the Energy Charter Treaty continues to be a valuable multilateral instrument to govern international energy relations."
"Its unique feature is that it sets legally binding rules on investment protection transit and that it contains provisions on dispute resolution in the energy sector."
"The European Union considers that Russia's renewed engagement in the Energy Charter process, as expressed in the last EU-Russia Summit, is very important and it will follow a constructive and open approach in that regard."
"In this context, the EU welcomes the Russian interest in a legally binding energy framework, following its recent proposal for a draft convention on ensuring international energy security."
"The modernisation of the Energy Charter process would be the appropriate context for multilateral negotiations on this proposal."
"I have an additional question."
"In the European Parliament, we are currently working on the future European investment policy."
"When it comes to Russia, we often hear about the expansion of Russian companies in the European market, especially in the energy sector, but, at the same time, European investors face enormous difficulties when they want to invest in Russia, especially in sectors that Russia deems as strategic, such as the energy sector."
"So how is the Commission going to ensure that the principle of reciprocity in the investment relationship is upheld in the new partnership agreement?"
"Member of the Commission. - In a week's time, we have a meeting with the Russian Government, and investment policy issues will certainly be discussed, because there are arguments on both sides."
"Russia also argues that some of its investments are not much appreciated in the European Union, so there are ongoing negotiations."
"At the same time, I can clearly say that in the last year, relations on quite difficult issues have started to improve: there has been more openness on the Russian side to discuss issues in depth and in detail."
"I believe, nevertheless, that relations should build on the agreement, and that the new agreements I have mentioned that will follow the PCA should have very strong investment protection clauses."
"That is the only way we can really avoid having situations where one side accuses the other side of not playing by the rules."
"The current political dynamic is giving rise to much hope that we can conclude this agreement, and include relatively strong provisions in it."
"It is very clear that in the last year, there have been some fundamental positive shifts in our relations."
"Subject: EU support for the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria"
"In the 2011 budget, considerable amounts have been allocated to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) (EUR 65 000 000 in commitment appropriations and EUR 47 608 950 in payment appropriations)."
"Recent reports have shown significant failings within the fund; and because of corruption and bribery problems involving the fund, some Member States have halted payments to it."
"How will the Commission ensure that the funds allocated to the GFATM are not used for bribery and corruption?"
"What has the Commission done to ensure that the GFATM still complies with the rules on eligibility for EU funds?"
"Has the Commission considered halting funding to the GFATM?"
"Member of the Commission. - This is a very pertinent question on an issue which the Commission takes very seriously and is therefore following closely and with great concern."
"The Commission is a very strong supporter of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"The Fund has been very successful and it is my full intention to work with the Fund to solve the issues as soon as possible in order for the Commission to continue to be one of the biggest contributors to the Fund."
"It is important to underline that the problems identified did not arise from the Fund itself, but in individual countries from the people contracted to implement the programmes."
"These are countries where very careful attention always has to be paid to avoid such problems."
"It is public knowledge that the Office of the Inspector General of the Global Fund has been conducting enquiries in respect of the use of USD 4.8 billion in 33 countries."
"These enquiries have taken place either on a systematic basis or in response to information received on the potential misappropriation of funds."
"Its inquiry is now complete; in line with common practice, the OIG has issued a report and published it on the website of the Global Fund."
"This practice has proven effective and transparent in implementing the Global Fund's stated policy of zero tolerance of corruption."
"For our part, the Commission has commissioned an independent five-pillar audit of the Global Fund, as required under European Union financial regulations for all organisations benefiting from EU financial support."
"The audit report delivered in November 2010 expressed the auditors' overall conclusion that the Global Fund's internal control environment respects the principles of division of responsibilities and of management control of country and regional financial reporting."
"So standard mechanisms and controls are in place to ensure that funds received from donors are properly handled."
"However, the auditors made several suggestions to improve the management of funds in addition to existing risk management strategy."
"Following this report, my services are currently discussing the needed modifications designed to improve and speed up the Global Fund reform agenda approved on 4 January."
"We are also undertaking a second audit mission, including country visits, to follow up on the institutional assessment."
"Through a letter dated 27 January 2011 and a teleconference on 2 February, I have already contacted the Executive Director of the Global Fund, Mr Kazatchkine, to express the urgent need for additional reforms to further strengthen the Fund's ground management processes and operations."
"In the meantime, during the Board meeting called on 2 February, the Secretariat of the Global Fund proposed an external review to be carried out by the Global Fund oversight mechanism."
"This was welcomed by Board members."
"So in reply to your question as to whether the Commission has considered halting EU funding to the Global Fund, I would inform you that the Commission has notified the Global Fund Executive Director and the Board members that the EU contributions are being put on hold."
"In parallel, I consider that the European Union, and the Commission in particular, must maintain its overall commitment to the Global Fund objectives, reform process and strategy of alignment to country and health systems."
"In this respect, the Commission is identifying clear criteria to apply before further contributions to the Global Fund can be resumed."
"These measures for ensuring prevention and detection of fraud have no implication in the delivery of vital treatment to the patient but, at the same time, understand that we need to have in place new, strengthened control mechanisms very fast, because as time passes, indefinitely holding on to payments is not the best option."
"We need additional strengthened control mechanisms at country level which will decrease the risk of misappropriation of the funds and can then resume payment."
"The Commission will, as I said, remain a keen supporter of the Fund because the Fund has achieved fantastic results, but there has been fraud and we need to deal with that fraud appropriately."
"(DA) Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his support for the Fund, but also for taking decisive action to deal with what has happened and for taking the matter very seriously."
"My question to the Commissioner, in specific terms, is what sort of timetable does he envisage with regard to the freezing of contributions to the Fund?"
"How quickly does he expect to be able to find a solution to the problems?"
"According to the Fund, some of those responsible for the misappropriation have been arrested."
"Action has been taken."
"I would like to know how long he expects it to be before the money can start to flow again."
"Commissioner, do you agree that the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is vital and that it would be criminal to halt funding now because it would bring to an end these lifesaving projects?"
"Furthermore, do you agree that we must, as you said, reinforce control mechanisms as well as our commitment to ensuring that the Global Fund delivers for those most in need - people at threat from AIDS/HIV, malaria and tuberculosis?"
"This evil of corruption must not be paid for by the innocent who are living with AIDS/HIV and who are at threat from malaria and tuberculosis."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"According to published statistics, the European Union earmarked funds of EUR 972.5 million for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria between 2002 and 2010."
"This accounted for approximately 50% of the Fund's total resources."
"My question is this: apart from what you have told us about the problems you have identified, has the Commission drafted an evaluation report or carried out an investigation into whether all this money was channelled to its intended target?"
"Member of the Commission. - There are two sides to this issue."
"On the one hand, I recognise that the Fund is doing fantastic work, reaching those most in need."
"There is no question about that."
"But, on the other hand, they are public funds."
"Public funds are taxpayers' money and one misappropriation or one fraud case could destroy the work of hundreds of thousands of people."
"So we need to find a solution very rapidly."
"My objective is to have the additional measures in place by the summer so that we can resume payments in the autumn."
"I believe that is doable."
"We have identified the areas where we need this: at national level."
"The Central Office is being well audited, and when we transfer money, everything is in order, but when it comes down to implementation in a given country, there are too many risk elements."
"If you saw which countries were involved and the size of the specific budgetary envelopes for them, you would realise that the sums involved would be too huge to suspend payments, and we need the reforms to work very rapidly."
"If it is discovered next year that there are misappropriations, you would be the first to tell me that I knew about the cases and asking why I did not take action."
"Then I would say that I was thinking only of sick people."
"That would not be a sufficient answer."
"If we sort this issue out in half a year, by the summer, then we will not have made any substantial impact on the functioning of the Fund, but we will have lent greater credibility both to the fund and to the way EU taxpayers' money is spent."
"Subject: The CE mark"
"Could the Commission outline what progress has been made on strengthening the CE mark in order to promote European exports in markets like South America and Asia, as this was one of the commitments that Commissioner Tajani made upon being appointed to office?"
"Madam President, Mr Higgins, the CE mark is the visible part of a mechanism that is crucially important for the smooth operation of the internal market."
"The adoption of the new legislative framework in 2008 strengthened the mark's reliability in three ways in particular."
"Firstly, it strengthened control of the CE product certification system; secondly, it introduced market surveillance by national authorities, which must check the manufacturers' declarations of conformity and the certificates issued by independent organisations that authorise the use of CE marks on products; and, thirdly, it requires the Member States to strengthen customs checks so that only products conforming to the legislation are allowed to circulate in European and world markets."
"By providing instruments designed to protect the CE mark, which were lacking until recently, the effective implementation of the new legislative framework strengthens the mark's credibility and therefore enhances the reputation of products bearing the mark in the European and, consequently, the international markets."
"Moreover, enhanced controls on imported products will ensure that there is less abuse of the CE mark in the world market."
"In addition, following the explicit request made by Parliament, the Commission has successfully launched an information campaign about the mark, aimed both at economic operators, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and at consumers."
"The aim of the campaign is to give interested parties, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, a better understanding of what the mark means and how the mechanism underlying it works, so that they can implement the rules on marking properly and defend themselves better in court in cases of counterfeiting or dangerous products."
"That will make European products more competitive."
"Our agreements and talks with third countries, including Mercosur and Latin America, particularly Argentina, are designed to promote the regulatory and technical model underlying the CE mark."
"During my contacts with that part of the world, I intend to clarify these points and, of course, to push for the solutions that we have agreed to implement."
"I will be in Latin America in the spring, and this subject will also be on the agenda of the meetings I will have with government representatives in the countries I am to visit: Brazil, Argentina and Chile."
"Of course, I reaffirm my commitment to work closely with you to ensure that the mechanism underlying the CE mark operates properly and that the Member States comply with the obligations aimed at making our products more competitive."
"I will, of course, keep you regularly informed about developments in this field, and let me remind you that the Commission will re-examine the situation and submit a report to Parliament in 2013, as required by Regulation (EC) No 765/2008."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I think the concept is very good."
"It is consumer-focused, it is about reputation, and the reliability of goods produced within the EU."
"But I cannot find any information from Eurostat, for example, as to how much this symbol is worth to European business, or what percentage of Europeans actually know what the CE does."
"Secondly, I believe that we should be exploiting it more."
"In April 2010 at the Hanover Fair, there was a major campaign to promote the CE mark, but we are not exploiting it enough."
"It needs a far more concerted effort, as the potential is absolutely huge."
"(RO) Madam President, since you mentioned the European Union's competitiveness and because I welcome the efforts you are making to develop a European Union industrial policy, I would like to ask you the following: what percentage of products available in the European market carry the CE mark and what percentage of products available in the European internal market are manufactured in China?"
"Madam President, I am grateful that a number of problems have been highlighted which are also the focus of our attention, because the honest truth is that products imported legally or illegally from outside the European Union are often counterfeit."
"Unfortunately, however, neither the Commission nor the Union's institutions have customs agencies or police forces to check imports, so we have to trust the checks carried out by the various Member States when products bearing this mark enter the EU and are placed on the market."
"Later, I will explain the details in order to answer Mr Higgins's supplementary question, but I must make it clear that we have launched an information campaign designed not only to promote the CE mark, but also to ensure that the products are more guaranteed, by checking for counterfeit goods."
"The suggestion of visiting the port of Rotterdam, which is where most toys arrive, is an idea that I have been nursing."
"I will probably go there myself in order to signal the fact that the Commission is focusing on checking products from outside the European Union that are coming in through one of its major ports."
"I agree with the point that use of the CE mark needs to be encouraged."
"We are in the early stages, and I believe we should continue down this path."
"That is the purpose of the information campaign, which is also the result of a request made by Parliament."
"We achieved a lot when I was still a Member of the European Parliament by insisting on the need for the EU to have a mark that would primarily guarantee compliance with EU regulations."
"In fact, we should not forget that the CE mark is not a European quality mark, but it just means that certain EU rules have been complied with - a kind of self-certification, therefore, or third-party certification."
"Some Members of this House hope that the CE mark will be followed by a quality mark and, in fact, Parliament pressed me on this at the hearing a year ago, when I put forward my candidacy for the Commission."
"I am certainly not against the idea, but I think we first need to encourage and increase the use of the CE mark by means of the information campaign within the EU."
"Even more needs to be done, and in the next stage, we need to think about further new initiatives."
"First of all, however, we must ensure that the CE mark becomes common practice for all EU companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which probably require more information."
"I assure you that I am committed to ever better information."
"I am delighted that there are debates and questions like these - and I thank Mr Higgins for them - because they spur on the debate through the work of the European Parliament and of its individual Members and the work of both the Commissioner and the representative offices of the Commission and Parliament in the European Union."
"It is vital to inform the individual Member States and business organisations of the importance of using this instrument, just as it is crucial - and I have already emphasised this in my speech - to put pressure on the Member States to maintain strict vigilance, both at the borders and within the market, in order to stamp out, or at least to try to curtail, the problem of counterfeiting and the unlawful use of the CE mark, for the sake of protecting our products and ensuring compliance with EU laws, which, above all, defend the interests of consumers."
"Subject: Uneven environment for growth and development in Member States"
"One of the key priorities of the 'Europe 2020' strategy is to support entrepreneurship through policies aimed at promoting growth and improving the business climate, in particular, for SMEs."
"Nevertheless, among Member States there is a very uneven business environment since, in many of them, setting up a new business involves a lot of red tape and high costs: this discourages entrepreneurship."
"Moreover, the economic crisis has exacerbated the problem and is creating a map of the EU characterised by disparities as regards entrepreneurship and thus growth."
"Does the Commission consider that the objective of business growth set out in the 'Europe 2020' strategy is realistic and can be achieved within the next decade in all Member States, given the existence of these disparities?"
"Will it recommend that Member States adopt specific policies and a common framework for addressing the problems which deter entrepreneurship?"
"Subject: Small to medium-sized enterprises"
"Can the Commission outline what measures are in place to help small to medium-sized companies based in Europe who wish to export and invest in developing economies such as China?"
"Subject: Entrepreneurship in countries implementing austerity measures"
"Are there any measures proposed to support entrepreneurship, particularly in those countries that are implementing severe austerity measures?"
"Madam President, I will try to be succinct, as I was when I was a Member of the European Parliament."
"We are dealing with issues of great interest, above all, the Commission's willingness to support entrepreneurship and to improve the context in which businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), operate, while supporting them in gaining access to third-country markets."
"I regard these three topics as a priority."
"That is why the Small Business Act for Europe, adopted by the Commission in 2008, is to be revised in the coming days."
"The principles and provisions of the Small Business Act are perfectly consistent with the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, and they are sure to be implemented at national level because all interested parties support them."
"In other words, everyone - Member States and business organisations alike - will be involved in monitoring the results obtained."
"We intend to ensure that the principles warmly supported in the Small Business Act, which are designed to promote entrepreneurship and eradicate the practice of always 'thinking small' when drawing up policies, will be implemented at both Union and national levels."
"We have already introduced a test for SMEs which is designed to take into greater account the procedure used in assessing the impact of the various policies and obligations that constrain SMEs."
"The revised Small Business Act will include measures to harmonise the use of this test and improve the quality of the assessments."
"In addition, all Member States will be encouraged to take the same approach in the procedures making up the national decision-making process."
"As we are aware of the need to cut red tape and eliminate disparities between countries, we will indicate specific measures - such as setting up one-stop shops and the use of e-government - to try to speed up processes in this area."
"The Commission is also organising the exchange of best practices among national civil servants on specific topics."
"In order to stimulate entrepreneurship among young people and encourage cross-border commercial cooperation in Europe, again at Parliament's instigation, we have set up an Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs, the results of which have been positive."
"It is our intention, therefore, to try to give the project a legal basis, transforming it from a pilot action into a permanent programme."
"We have also planned actions specifically targeting women entrepreneurs: we have a network now comprising 250 female ambassadors from 22 European countries."
"I hope this network can grow even stronger."
"Lastly, we are working to create mentoring programmes for women entrepreneurs in at least 12 EU countries."
"As regards assistance to SMEs for exports and investments outside the Union, we launched a huge public consultation exercise at the beginning of last year on our intention to strengthen support measures."
"The results of the exercise will enable us to adjust the proposed guidelines aimed at strengthening SME support services while, at the same time, ensuring efficient use of public funds."
"We have already gained plenty of experience in terms of helping SMEs become international."
"I am referring to projects that have enjoyed considerable success, such as the China Intellectual Property Rights SME Helpdesk, the EU-Japan Centre for Industrial Cooperation, the Enterprise Europe network, and training programmes."
"In addition, based on the results of a study funded by Parliament, we are preparing a communication on strengthening support for SMEs in third-country markets."
"With regard to emerging economies such as China, I can confirm that in the framework of the Small Business Act, the Commission has used the funds allocated by Parliament for the preparatory work, which has enabled us to set up SME assistance and support centres in China and India."
"I myself was in Beijing last November at the opening of the Centre for European Union SMEs in China."
"I can also tell you that tomorrow, the Commission is appointing a new Special Envoy for SMEs, Daniel Calleja Crespo, Deputy Director General for Enterprise and Industry, who will be responsible for closely monitoring the implementation of the Small Business Act and acting as a contact point for SMEs."
"The Commission document currently being adopted invites all the Member States and local authorities to appoint an Envoy for SMEs to supervise the implementation of the Small Business Act within the regions of the European Union."
"I am pleased to tell you that I have already received positive replies from a number of Member States and several EU regions."
"(EL) Madam President, thank you very much for what you said, Commissioner; this is all very ambitious."
"However, to go back a bit, the Competitiveness Council called on the Member States in December 2008 to reduce company start-up times to a maximum of three days and, of course, the Commission promised to monitor that development."
"Three years later, and in the midst of an economic crisis, we see that it takes 15 days to incorporate a company in Greece, 11 days in Austria, 8 days in Finland and, in Belgium, just a day and a half."
"In other words, there are huge discrepancies."
"My question is this: as we all agree that entrepreneurship is a prerequisite to growth, how can the Commission move from simply urging to putting serious pressure on governments, so that we can harmonise the procedures?"
"I would like to make three points."
"First of all, with regard to the China helpdesk."
"Whilst a wonderful idea, SMEs find it very difficult to get access for the sectors that they are specifically involved in."
"It seems to be more suited to larger-scale enterprises."
"Secondly, the one-stop shop idea, which is already in use internally within the EU, could be put to better use in the BRIC countries - that is Brazil, Russia, India and China - to increase the amount of exports and outward investment that European companies can make."
"Thirdly and finally, the model that has worked best so far has been the EU-Japan relationship."
"That has worked best for trade and investment in both areas."
"Perhaps that should be the standard to be followed."
"I suppose my question is a slightly difficult one, in that it relates to countries that are implementing severe austerity measures like my own, Ireland."
"This is the bottom line: SMEs need access to credit and they are not getting that for a number of reasons, perhaps because banks are looking for more collateral than they can provide, or sometimes, SMEs just do not want to risk borrowing in the current climate when there is no growth."
"My question is, in that context, could the Commission endorse other measures such as loan-guarantee schemes or, indeed, an extension of the EU microfinance facility?"
"Madam President, honourable Members, I am really delighted that the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises is at the heart of parliamentary debate for the second day in a row."
"Yesterday evening, we looked at the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) as well as how to help small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-enterprises to access EU financing in the context of the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme."
"We also noted what we have already done and what we are currently doing for this category of enterprises."
"As I said in my speech - and as I also stated yesterday evening - I think that supporting small and medium-sized enterprises is a priority for a number of reasons."
"First of all, we cannot but consider small and medium-sized enterprises as an essential tool for recovering from the current crisis."
"Through the Europe 2020 document, we put the real economy back at the heart of economic policy."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of our real economy and, above all, moving forward, I think that SMEs can also play a crucial social role because they are the ones that will create new jobs in the European Union, even while big industrial corporations are undergoing restructuring."
"We therefore need to create the conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises to be competitive."
"Competitiveness is another word for innovation, and to be innovative, we need to help SMEs to access credit."
"Thanks to the support of the European Parliament, we have adopted the directive on late payments by public authorities and in business-to-business transactions, which falls under the Small Business Act."
"This is a fantastic result and I hope that the Member States implement this directive, which is now binding for the whole European Union, within 24 months from last October and perhaps even before the final deadline."
"This will inject around EUR 180 billion of liquidity into the market, to the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is not all."
"I have also created the SME Finance Forum, as noted in Parliament's report on policies for SMEs and the CIP."
"This is a new creation of the Commission, where we will examine the difficulties involved in accessing credit and formulate solutions to these problems."
"It is not by chance that we have convinced the London Stock Exchange to take part in this initiative for the first time."
"This is a strong signal from Great Britain too, which is tantamount to powerful support for small and medium-sized enterprises from the world of finance."
"Therefore, the financial economy is working to support and serve the real economy, which I think is an important sign."
"I will take steps to continue supporting the work of the SME Finance Forum in terms of access to credit and will also identify all available initiatives, including cross-border venture capital and the attempt to ease the 'bottlenecks' between the European Investment Bank and domestic credit institutions, which are the ones that grant the financing in the end."
"What should we do to make it easier to access EU financing?"
"We are currently working on the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme and a number of victories have been won for SMEs."
"I will repeat what I said yesterday evening because I do not know if the honourable Members here this evening were also here yesterday: regarding the Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), I have cut back registration taxes to 60% for SMEs and 90% for micro-enterprises."
"I also made sure that the rules for the implementation of the REACH Regulation were translated into all the languages of the European Union."
"SMEs are therefore seeing signs of real support from this direction as well."
"It is our intention to do the same for micro-enterprises in the construction sector, too."
"I have held quite a number of meetings on microcredit as well."
"I also examined the issue carefully during a meeting held two weeks ago in Brussels with the representative of the Italian Government's new microcredit organisation, which looks like a well-run example."
"I hope to be able to spread knowledge of the best practices of the various Member States in this sector, so that they can be implemented."
"In terms of the disparities in the time needed for authorisation, this is a real problem."
"There is no doubt that we must exert pressure on the Member States to cut red tape."
"Much is made of European bureaucracy - which certainly has its own burdens - but sometimes bureaucracy in the Member States runs it pretty close. In any case, I think that it is in the interest of citizens to streamline procedures."
"When we say that we should 'think small', we need to make sure that the Member States also apply this test, just as the Commission has begun to. The presentation of the review of the Small Business Act in the various European capital cities will also provide a chance to urge the Member States to reduce the time required to issue authorisations for the creation of SMEs."
"Subject: Commission's equal opportunities strategy"
"On 17 December 2010, the Commission launched a new equal opportunities strategy for the period to 2014, in which it set new targets for the number of women in senior and middle management positions and for the recruitment of women to administrator (AD) posts in the Commission's directorates-general, departments and services."
"The new equal opportunities strategy will thus seek to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women working at the Commission, but does not extend to the EU's other institutions and agencies."
"Will the Commission's equal opportunities strategy affect women working in other EU institutions?"
"Does the Commission see a need to draw up a common strategy on equal opportunities, in order to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women working in other European agencies and institutions as well?"
"Gender equality and equal opportunities are fundamental EU principles and should therefore apply universally, without exception, to all EU workers."
"Member of the Commission. - I am very happy to have received this question, because I have good news to report."
"Since 1 January, there have, for the first time, actually been more women than men working for the Commission."
"We are very proud of this result, but we know that this is not the end of it."
"We still need to continue with our policy of also improving the figures for our female colleagues in managerial positions and non-managerial posts (AD) in the Commission."
"We therefore adopted this strategy from 2010 to 2014, until the end of this Commission's mandate."
"We really would like to achieve a result where women would represent 25% of senior management positions, 30% of middle management and 43% of AD non-management posts."
"We have already achieved quite a lot over the last 15 years with the tremendous increase of women in managerial positions."
"We would, of course, like to continue with this same effort."
"The method we are going to use would be that retirements would be replaced with women, who would represent 30% of recruitment among senior management and 50% among middle managers and ADs."
"So that means that when these managers retire, 30% or 50% of them should be replaced by women."
"In answer to your question, I checked the situation in other institutions and I must say that you are doing quite well in Parliament. The figures are very impressive."
"It is not quite the same in the case of the Council, though to be honest, we have slightly different results."
"But I think that the best method to progress further would be if we continued with our policy of exchanging best practice, and in exchanging experience about the implementation of our policies."
"I know that our heads of administration, our secretaries-general, are discussing this issue on a regular basis also, and I believe that this exchange of good practice will lead to the appropriate results in all EU institutions."
"(LT) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for the good news."
"I welcome the fact that there are more women than men in the Commission."
"However, here is an additional question I would like to ask you."
"How much time do you think the European Commission would need for the percentage of women in management positions to reach not 25%, not 42%, but 50%?"
"How long do you think that would take?"
"You said that you will only have achieved this by the end of your mandate."
"Nevertheless, you did not answer my question very clearly."
"As a Commissioner, what is your view of the European Union institutions' equal opportunities strategy?"
"That of all of the European Union institutions?"
"This would be a very good example to the Member States, both to people working in the public and in the private sectors."
"(RO) Madam President, I would like to expand a little on the question from my colleague and ask the Commissioner whether there is also an equal opportunities strategy."
"I am referring here to the appointment of persons from the new Member States to middle and senior management positions in EU institutions."
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you very much for your supplementary questions."
"I agree with you that the figures you mentioned might not seem as ambitious as you would like them to be in the future, but the truth is that since we started with equal opportunity policies within the Commission in 1995, we have managed to increase the presence of women in top positions fivefold."
"This means that now there are five times as many women in these positions than before."
"Of course, we have to look at the baseline."
"I agree with you that it was very low."
"We also have to compare in what kind of environment in Europe we are operating."
"This is also part of the response to the second question, namely, that policies for creating these conditions for women, not only in the EU institutions but also in the Member States, must still be improved."
"First, we need to create suitable conditions for women so that they can actually work in these high positions, which means adequate childcare, adequate working facilities, flexitime and other conditions which actually allow women to be in these high positions."
"Of course, these conditions are being created gradually."
"I think we have achieved quite high standards in the European institutions and you can see the various levels at which these conditions have been secured among the Member States."
"Therefore, my colleague, Vice-President Reding, is now proposing a strategy which will be called gender balance in business leadership."
"So far, this is a staff working document, which will be discussed with business leaders in two months' time, and then the public consultations will start."
"What are the lessons to be learned in this process?"
"Should we go through an obligatory quota system?"
"Should we go for the system we have in the Commission, where we are trying to create a conducive environment and managerial incentives for those DGs which can actually fulfil the goals established for women?"
"I think that after that, we will see appropriate results."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I just want to make an observation and I know many Members would agree with me."
"It is nothing to do with you personally, but concerns the way Question Time is organised."
"From night to night, no Member knows how many questions are going to be taken, how many supplementaries are going to be taken, how long the answers will take, and whether or not we will have a Question Time to the Commission or Council at all."
"That is unsatisfactory."
"I met Baroness Ludford."
"She was an hour late for a dinner because she expected her question to be taken."
"I calculated that my question would be taken and I refused an invitation to dinner."
"At the very least, Members should be told in advance how many questions are going to be taken, and then they can plan accordingly."
"I know I will get a written answer, but if I and other Members want a written answer, we could send an email from the comfort of our own homes and we would get a reply to our email."
"That is all I want to say."
"I think it should be taken on board."
"Madam President, it is nothing to do with you: you handle it very well."
"I mean no disrespect whatsoever to you."
"Mr Kelly, thank you for your intervention."
"I should say as one of the Vice-Presidents responsible for Question Time that I am concerned that we have not moved, as an institution, with the Commission, to implement what we agreed in our interinstitutional agreement, which was to improve Question Time."
"I am glad that Commissioner Šefčovič is here tonight and has seen the problems that we are experiencing at first hand."
"I hope therefore there may be a new dynamic to try to move to the situation that we had envisaged when negotiating the interinstitutional agreement."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20:50 and resumed at 21:00)"
"Situation in Albania (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in Albania."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for inviting me to speak on Albania this evening."
"Although on the European mainland, Albania was isolated for a large part of the 20th century."
"However, Albania is now open and accessible."
"It has become a country with a European perspective."
"Today, Albania is in political crisis."
"The developments in Tirana on Friday, 21 January 2011, were tragic."
"The increasingly bitter political stalemate has resulted in four needless deaths."
"The tone in Tirana needs to change."
"The dangerous downward spiral must end."
"The political crisis must be resolved."
"This is the shared responsibility of the political leaders in Albania."
"That is what the citizens of Albania expect, and they are right."
"Democratically elected representatives must act as such: represent the people and find democratic compromise."
"If the solution to the crisis lies in domestic hands, we as outsiders must do all we can to help facilitate such a solution."
"The External Action Service managing director, Miroslav Lajčák, visited Tirana twice to meet the President, the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition, and I am happy he has joined me today."
"His messages on behalf of the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, and myself were clear: first, stop the violence and investigate the events of 21 January correctly."
"These investigations should be conducted by the judicial authorities without political interference."
"Second, stop the verbal abuse and the implicit and explicit undermining of State institutions."
"Third, get the political dialogue back on track: acknowledge that you have a shared responsibility to secure a more positive future for Albania."
"In the near future, this means jointly ensuring the conduct of free, fair and transparent local elections."
"Fourth, begin the important task of implementing the 12 priorities outlined in the 2010 Commission opinion."
"The government and opposition must do it together."
"The reactions of the political leaders and the general public to Miroslav Lajčák's visit were encouraging and positive respectively."
"There is some momentum which can, and should, be used to turn the crisis into opportunity."
"The two Albanian leaders welcome the attention given to them, but they are stuck in their own internal impasse, and European Union goodwill and assistance cannot replace dialogue between the leaders."
"We can help to bridge the gap through our active engagement."
"However, we cannot do so before both sides signal a genuine willingness to put the European future of Albania above party politics and personal mistrust."
"There is no place for cherry-picking."
"Albania must meet all the Copenhagen criteria, including interactive political dialogue and a functioning Parliament - or nothing."
"The following is on the table for Albania: an EU perspective in line with the Council conclusions and based on the Copenhagen criteria; a clear identification in the 2010 Commission opinion of the 12 priorities whose effective implementation would enable Albania to begin accession negotiations with the European Union."
"These 12 priorities include, among others, improving the functioning of democratic institutions and the political dialogue, the rule of law and reform of the judiciary, the fight against organised crime and the protection of human rights."
"These 12 priorities and the Copenhagen criteria are not just an exercise for politicians."
"Rather, they bring clear, measurable benefits for citizens."
"Albania's politicians urgently need to put the interests of Albania's citizens first."
"Let us turn these priorities into a European framework to address the current political challenges in Albania."
"For this reason, I sent a letter to Prime Minister Berisha one week before the January demonstrations, in which I set out a road map based on these 12 priorities, to help Albania emerge from the current impasse."
"We all witnessed the tragic events that ensued."
"It is not too late."
"If we receive irreversible signals that there is a mutual willingness to use this European framework to gradually overcome the political stalemate and the recent crisis, then we will respond positively."
"The European Parliament also has a vital role to play."
"You as politicians can send a clear message to politicians."
"A clear united message from this House and the whole European Union with the readiness to engage would make all in Albania reflect upon the best course of action."
"Let me use this opportunity to call on the Prime Minister of Albania, Mr Berisha, to create a truly inclusive political environment in Albania."
"Other political forces and civil society organisations would benefit from European integration."
"Let me also call on the leader of the Socialist Party, Mr Rama, to ensure that his party is a truly constructive opposition - one which enjoys the benefits but also the responsibilities of this inclusive political environment we wish to see in Albania."
"Mr President, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank you very much for your clear statement."
"I believe that it has been well received."
"I think that developments in the fields of democracy and the rule of law are essential requirements for the start of Albania's accession process to the EU."
"This includes functioning democratic institutions which are used properly."
"The parliament is the place where democratic debates should take place."
"This is why the citizens have elected the members of the parliament."
"This forum cannot be replaced by events on the streets and particularly not in the way in which Mr Rama attempted to do on 21 January."
"I call on the socialist party to take full part in the parliamentary process and to come up with political alternatives in parliament."
"It is time to bring an end to the doubts about the election result."
"The socialist party should take responsibility for its role as parliamentary opposition."
"It should make use of the opportunity to produce specific proposals for the future, including in the parliamentary investigation committee."
"The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) have produced recommendations for improving the basic conditions of elections."
"It is also important for the socialists to be involved in this area too."
"I have heard that Mr Rama agreed, while he was here in Strasbourg, to take part in the local elections on 8 May."
"I welcome his decision."
"I hope that his assurance does not involve any conditions or loopholes."
"Mr Rama is obviously listening to the good advice given to him by his socialist colleagues and also in the meetings with other groups."
"I can assure him that many people in our group are playing an active role on our behalf in Albania and support the inclusive approach referred to by Mr Füle."
"This has enabled us to make a joint contribution to ensuring a positive future for Albania."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, we could certainly call the political situation in Albania today a stalemate."
"Sometimes calmer, at other times violent, this crisis has no end."
"Last year, this Parliament adopted a resolution calling on all domestic political players to find a negotiated political solution to the crisis and to build a minimum national consensus."
"This resolution was ignored by the political forces, and by the government especially."
"Likewise, the recommendations of the Commission and of the Council are being disregarded at this moment in time."
"It is inadmissible that exercising the right to rally and to protest in a country plagued by corruption be described as a coup d'état."
"It is inadmissible that the credibility of the State institutions - the Presidency, Public Attorney and others - be undermined by statements by the Head of Government."
"It is inadmissible that those who shoot civilian demonstrators be called heroes of the nation and promised an amnesty."
"New local elections will take place soon."
"In the present circumstances, they will be a political test for all political stakeholders."
"We ask Commissioner Füle and managing director Lajčák to do their best in order to assure international assistance and international monitoring of these elections in such a way as to make sure that they will be free and fair, or at least that we could assess their freedom and their fairness."
"We support the Commission approach, and that of Commissioner Füle in particular."
"We support the action by Mr Lajčák."
"We have to ask all political forces to bring this crisis to an end, because the alternative is the isolation of Albania and the jeopardising of its European perspectives."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I had a very interesting day today when it comes to Albania."
"I have spoken to the representatives of the two main political parties there."
"I asked both of them to share ideas on how to move the country forward and how to break the political stalemate to focus on problems affecting all citizens: fighting organised crime, ending corruption, creating employment and opportunities for the young generation."
"None of them was able to come up with an answer."
"The blame game seemed more important."
"It occurs to me that the political establishment in Albania is more concerned with itself than with its people."
"I do not have to tell you how difficult it is for us to convince our constituents to join us when we are making the case for EU enlargement."
"Despite resistance, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to see the Western Balkans become part of the territory of the European Union."
"We believe that the EU is a community of values which has left behind a divided past, choosing a united future."
"We must call on the Albanian authorities to do the same and not be suffocated by the shadows of the past, but to step into the light of the future."
"And let them not forget that it is their responsibility, first and foremost, to provide for the wellbeing of citizens and not to deny them a European future, because it is crystal clear that the political crisis hampers any and all progress."
"New elections will take place in May and the preparations are under way."
"They should be supported by all political parties."
"I welcome the suggestion that the EU should play an active role in ensuring that they are both free and fair."
"But democracy is a long process and it is certainly more than just 'one man, one vote'."
"It requires democratic institutions, the rule of law and its strength is determined by respect for minorities."
"Democracy is not 'winner takes all'."
"EU accession is a long journey which requires hard work and shared commitment, and the reforms Albania has made are best served by collaboration and continuing commitment to the EU process."
"Mr President, the crisis in Albania is nothing new."
"The crisis did not begin in January with the violence against the demonstrators, nor did it begin in 2009, when the Socialist Party boycotted parliament after the elections and when the hunger strike began."
"This crisis is a crisis of political culture."
"Boycotts, hunger strikes, demonstrations, they are normal methods of doing business in Albanian politics."
"So are corruption, manipulation of the media and political appointments."
"All of that is a world away from the kind of politics we would like to see in a country which is on the road to accession."
"I so, so hope that the citizens of Albania eventually get a responsible government and a responsible parliament, with politicians who will put the welfare of their citizens above their own prestige and interests."
"Both sides need to start to move in order to reach that stage."
"The government has a particular responsibility."
"Governments have a monopoly on violence and governments have an additional responsibility to stand above party politics, in order to do what is right for the people."
"We should be able to expect this government to do everything possible to prevent the January events from happening again."
"We should also be able to expect it to cooperate fully with the launch of an independent inquiry into what happened in January, to clamp down on corruption within its own ranks, and to provide room for parliamentary debate."
"The opposition also has a responsibility."
"It, too, must do everything to prevent a repeat of the January violence, by cooperating fully with proper and fair elections in May and by participating in parliamentary debate, preferably on content, for once, such as the sky-high levels of unemployment in Albania."
"How do you get both parties that far, though?"
"I had every hope in November when Commissioner Füle put the ball in Albania's court and said: no more progress until you resolve this."
"When that happens, we will be able to grant Albania candidate status."
"Unfortunately, that did not bring about any change."
"I am now hoping that Mr Lajčák will succeed where others have failed: that is, in bringing both parties to the table and achieving a breakthrough."
"I am hopeful, but I am not very confident that this will be possible without us wielding a big stick."
"I think that we should hold the prospect of a sanction over them."
"It must be clear that failure in this negotiation effort will not be without consequences."
"The sanction must hit the political leaders, however, and not the citizens."
"That means that we must by no means tamper with Albania's visa waiver, which is a suggestion I have heard in the corridors."
"We would really be harming the citizens if we did that."
"I would really like an assurance from the Commissioner that visa liberalisation will not be abused in this political process."
"One idea we could start considering, however, is withdrawing the control of IPA funds from Albania and putting it back in the hands of the EU."
"That would allow all major investments in the country to go through, but the government would more or less be placed under guardianship."
"That seems to me to be a sanction that would hit the politicians, but not the people."
"I sincerely hope that all this will be unnecessary, because both sides will be willing to compromise, and that Mr Lajčák will succeed, in the interests of the Albanian people."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, if Albania is to make progress towards its eventual goal of EU accession, its political leaders need to engage in a more constructive, democratic and mature way."
"Last month's violence was a reminder of the inherent instability of Albanian politics."
"I also wonder whether the Council and Commission have considered revisiting last year's decision to grant Albanians visa-free travel to the EU in the light of the bloodshed, which may, of course, generate more economic emigration to the Schengen area if foreign direct investment dries up."
"Such a step would certainly underline the fact that Albania continues to fall well short of the EU's expectations."
"Organised crime and corruption still flourish and the judiciary is too often manipulated by politicians."
"Prime Minister Berisha even interfered with the arrest, ordered by the Prosecutor-General, of guardsmen who had shot protestors, claiming that a coup d'état was imminent."
"Democratic institutions are weak and press freedom is scarce."
"The decision by Edi Rama's Socialist Party to boycott the parliament on the basis of alleged electoral fraud has compounded Albania's instability."
"There is no way Albania can even begin to enact the reforms necessary to regain the EU's confidence in the current political environment of instability."
"This instability may also now cause NATO to reconsider its own enlargement policy, Albania having joined the alliance less than two years ago."
"NATO leaders must now question whether Albanian membership was granted too soon."
"Aside from my own concerns about Albania's political instability and how it will impact on the country's EU aspirations, I am also sceptical about Albania's strategic priorities."
"Albania is a full member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, an increasingly powerful and influential lobby in the UN promoting the interests of its members and voting as a bloc on human rights and foreign policy matters."
"OIC members include Albania and Turkey, both of whom are signatories to the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights, which cites sharia as the basis for human rights in Muslim countries."
"Albania, like Turkey, must now decide between embracing western values, or whether to give primacy to those of sharia law which the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has deemed incompatible with European values, though so far, in my view, Albania's membership of the OIC, in fairness, seems only nominal."
"Albania is, after all, a secular country in practice."
"It seems to have been designed by the Albanian leadership that they join the OIC in order to attract Middle Eastern money, rather than based on any strong religious convictions, but, of course, this could all change in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I had hoped that, eighteen months after the last parliamentary elections in Albania, the political impasse would have been resolved."
"I had hoped, following the recommendations made and the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, that what we were saying would be borne in mind."
"I was convinced that Albania's hopes of European integration would act as a strong incentive - as that is what the Albanian people want - to resolve not only the political problem, but also the economic, social and democratic problems."
"Unfortunately, the impasse persists."
"As to who bears the lion's share of responsibility, I believe that it is not our job here to judge the Albanian people."
"Unfortunately, however, things have got worse."
"Once again, I would like to express my sorrow for the victims of the demonstration on 21 January."
"We are opposed to the escalation of violence; we call for repression to stop, for human and democratic rights to be respected, and for those responsible to be punished."
"However, I will not conceal the fact that I am concerned about the imminent local elections in May."
"We simply must do whatever we can to ensure that all the necessary safeguards are in place for them to proceed smoothly."
"We must persuade all the political forces to participate in this election procedure and these elections must be held on the basis of international rules for proper, democratic elections."
"I believe that our help, help from the European Parliament and the European Union in general - and I agree here with Mr Füle - must be supplementary, must be auxiliary and, obviously, must not be coloured by party affiliations and political friendships (if you will pardon the expression)."
"It will not be for us to provide the solution to Albanian society and to the Albanian problem."
"This must be dealt with by the Albanian people, by the political forces in Albania."
"I do not agree with the thoughts voiced about threats to take measures, when most of the measures we have heard about are measures against the Albanian people."
"I do not think that this will bring about any particular result."
"I believe that we can exert the greatest possible pressure through the EU institutions, within the framework of relations with a country which is knocking at the door of the European Union, by stressing that, unfortunately, all these procedures are delaying its accession prospects."
"We must point out that the impasse will only be resolved by a responsible stand on the part of the political leaders, with a readiness for political dialogue and not, as we have heard, with a 'winner takes all' attitude and similar practices and conduct."
"I believe that, if the political leaders in Albania insist on this sort of practice and this sort of approach, the impasse and the crisis will get worse, making it impossible for the country to address serious problems in addition to the political problem: problems that will arise - if they have not already arisen - from the economic crisis which has hit the neighbouring countries of Italy and Greece, given that money sent from these countries is, to a degree, helping the economic situation in Albania."
"Consequently, a solution to the political impasse, political responsibility and political dialogue are what will help the political leaders find a rapid solution to the problems facing Albania."
"Mr President, I visited Albania as a journalist on several occasions in the 1990s."
"Each time, I was impressed by the talented young people I met there."
"Surely, a country with young people like that must have a future."
"Last summer, my faith in Albania's European prospects was renewed during a summer school in southern Vlorë County."
"This morning, I exchanged emails with a couple of Albanian academics about this evening's debate."
"They are both in their thirties and they have both decided to stay in Albania: they could earn much more abroad, but they are staying."
"They want to be of service to their own people and to their church."
"However, what can they do about the political impasse in their home country?"
"In both cases, their message is clear, and it is a cry for help: 'Europe, do not leave our political leaders to their own devices."
"Because, if you do, they will destroy our nation's future."
"Europe, force both parties, the socialists and the democrats, to negotiate until they reach a solution'."
"Commissioner, I will be the first one to admit that this is easier said than done, but theirs was a cry for help, nonetheless."
"However, I am confident that you will want to do your best to fulfil the hope that many upstanding Albanian citizens have placed in Europe and in you, as the Commissioner responsible."
"I wish you a great deal of strength and success in this."
"To conclude, there is another, equally important Albanian issue which I would like to raise."
"An informant in Tirana has alerted me to the danger that, this spring, a large number of Albanian girls and women are going to travel to Western Europe and end up in prostitution rings."
"Do you share this concern, Commissioner, and what resources does the European Union have at its disposal to take preventive action against the trafficking of women and the grooming of girls for prostitution in Albania?"
"(HU) Mr President, the political life of Albania has been at an impasse since the parliamentary elections in 2009."
"The parliament cannot exercise its supervisory role over the government, and parliamentary institutions are, unfortunately, not operating effectively."
"The fact that the socialists are accusing the government of electoral fraud and corruption, demanding its resignation and early elections before those due in 2013, as well as the fact that Prime Minister Berisha is unwilling to resign and is accusing the opposition of attempting to come into power by force, indicate that negotiations with the European Union are doomed to fail very quickly."
"The European Union considers it vital for candidate countries to step up their efforts in the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"This is not only important for the EU, but is also beneficial for the society of the countries concerned, not to mention that it can contribute to the improvement of the image of the candidate countries."
"For this reason, the settlement of the current situation will definitely require the restoration of democratic institutions."
"Mr President, the political crisis in Albania has lasted for far too long now."
"Yes, it is not deadlock, it is not a stalemate, it is a protracted political crisis."
"It is hurting the reputation of the country, its citizens and their ambitions for a European future."
"We should not allow this political crisis and tensions to go any further."
"What we need now is to send a common message that we want to have Albania as a candidate country, but political leaders on both sides must show the will to solve political problems in full respect for the rule of law, the constitution and on the foundation of democratic institutions."
"We have tried for too long to help find a solution to the situation without any tangible results."
"We strongly condemn the violence which took place in the streets of Tirana during the demonstrations on 21 January."
"The events that cost the lives of four people need to be properly investigated."
"Albania is awaiting the local elections of May this year."
"This will be another check on democracy in the country."
"Again, now is the time for the political leaders to concentrate their efforts on finding guarantees that the elections are not going to bring further tensions and prolong the crisis."
"In concluding, I wish to emphasise the importance of the political messages and proposals contained in the speech by Commissioner Füle at the beginning of this debate."
"The best possible contribution Parliament can make in this situation is to put all its weight behind these proposals and, accordingly, send a clear joint message to the Albanian political parties."
"(DE) Mr President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Füle for his clear statement today and for his commitment to this issue over a long period."
"I would also like to thank Mr Lajčák for the dedication that he has shown over recent months."
"He is used to addressing and resolving tricky problems."
"I wish both of them the best of luck."
"This debate has resulted in a united front and in joint support for the efforts of both men to find a solution for Albania."
"I admit that I was sceptical when this debate started."
"Nothing could be worse for the development of Albania than accusations being made by one side in this House against the other that are similar to those being made by the two major political groups, the government and the opposition, in Albania."
"I am very pleased that we have been able to agree on a joint approach, at least until now."
"I hope that this remains the case."
"Both sides, both political groups - the government and the opposition - must commit to finding a way out of this crisis."
"I agree with Mr Belder."
"Not long after the fall of the Hoxha regime, I went to Albania."
"I was very struck by the mood there and by the enthusiasm of the young people."
"However, I am very disappointed when I look at what has come out of this and what has not."
"I must say that the political class in Albania is not able to satisfy the wishes and the ideas of the people."
"Of course, we still have our political affinities and our personal friendship."
"However, it is crucial for us now to tell both sides that they must sit down together and attempt to ensure that the local elections at least are transparent and open."
"We must also call on both sides to be prepared to implement the requirements drawn up by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) for these elections, either by means of legislation or practical action, so that there will be genuinely fair and transparent elections in future."
"I also believe that Parliament should send as many election observers as possible, despite the fact that these are local elections, because the elections could represent the beginning of a new political climate in Albania."
"This is what Albania urgently needs."
"I agree with everyone who has said that if nothing changes in Albania, it will find itself in an isolated position."
"However, we do not want Albania to be isolated."
"We want it to start out on the road towards Europe."
"(BG) Mr President, I would like to start by saying that Albanian society, and the Albanian people, are a special case, but please do not misunderstand me."
"Their history is different, and their cultural traditions are different, and some of these differences have survived in the national character, the way in which it has developed, to this day, and this affects the way they perceive political processes and develop them."
"Therefore, if we are going to instrumentalise the problem under discussion, we will need to show creativity, flexibility and imagination."
"For example, I believe that we should contact not just the leaders of the two main political parties which are at loggerheads, but also the unofficial leaders of Albanian society."
"Some correct things have been said here about sharia and the Islamic Conference, but we must bear in mind that the Albanians are tolerant towards all three main religions in their country, including the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic churches."
"All three of these communities have influential leaders, as do NGOs and youth."
"We should also be addressing these leaders in our attempts to reconcile the two political parties."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Füle, Mr Lajčák, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in thanking Mr Füle and Mr Lajčák for their hard work and their attempts to find a way out of this problem."
"I am also pleased that the debate today has not descended into squabbles between the political groups which are in conflict with one another in Albania."
"It would have been very regrettable for Parliament if this had happened and I hope that we do not reach this point."
"The institutional crisis in Albania is really also a crisis in the political culture."
"It is all about verbal violence that has turned into violence on the streets and resulted in four deaths."
"I agree with those who say that this needs to be investigated."
"It is important to find out who is really to blame."
"However, this process of verbal violence becoming actual violence on the streets is something that could put Albania's accession to the European Union at risk."
"As Mr Füle has already explained, this is all about making it clear to the political opponents in Albania that their job is to act in the interests of the Albanian people."
"The route towards the European Union means finding a solution for this political crisis, sitting down at the same table and putting an end to the constant blame game, in which one group always blames the other and fails to recognise that it, too, can make a contribution to changing things."
"That is what is needed."
"The constant accusations about who started the situation and who is to blame have no place in a European state."
"I hope that the opposing parties will learn from this and realise that this situation cannot go on."
"If Mr Rama and his party really take part in the local elections, as he has indicated to some of us today that he will, and appoint members of the election commission, I welcome this and I hope it is a first step towards ensuring that these local elections can take place in an open and transparent form and that the results will be accepted afterwards."
"The parliament fully supported the liberalisation process which has already been mentioned."
"My request to Mr Füle is as follows: I hope that the Commission does not consider abandoning visa liberalisation for the citizens of Albania as a possible sanction against the two opposing parties."
"I hope that will not be the case."
"My other question concerns the opportunities for applying more pressure if the two parties do not come to an agreement."
"One option is, as Mrs Cornelissen has already said, taking responsibility for managing the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) funds away from the government and returning it to the Commission."
"The other possibility would be to freeze the IPA funds."
"However, this would cause suffering among the population, which cannot be our intention."
"What are your plans in the event that no solution can be reached?"
"One last point: in the Marty report to the Council of Europe, the accusation was made that the Albanian secret service was involved or supported organ trafficking."
"Do you know whether the Albanian secret service and the Albanian justice system are prepared to cooperate?"
"(SK) Mr President, since the 2009 general elections, there has been political tension in Albania arising from the close result of the vote, which the losing political forces have described as electoral manipulation."
"The Albanian socialists, led by Edi Rama, accuse Prime Minister Sali Berisha not only of electoral fraud, but also of being responsible for extensive corruption and the deteriorating living conditions of the people."
"At a protest rally organised by the opposition in the Albania capital, Tirana, on 21 January, there were more than 20 000 demonstrators demanding the resignation of the government of Sali Berisha."
"However, police intervention involving water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets resulted in four deaths and more than 150 injuries."
"The brutality of the police intervention, as well as the fact that Sali Berisha gave all members of the security forces participating in suppressing the demonstration an extraordinary reward amounting to one month's pay, is clear evidence of the fact that the Albanian premier is buying the favour of the security forces and trying to win their support and to set them against the Albanian people."
"In decent, civilised countries, government is usually decided by the citizens, the voters, and not by bribed security forces or the police."
"If Mr Berisha has forgotten this elementary principle of democratic government, then in my opinion, he has no business being the leader of a democratic state."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think any of us would like to see in Europe the promotion of governments which build their power on electoral fraud and corrupt policemen, and which are represented by little dictators who do not know how to hand over power to others in the proper way in a country."
"We must therefore be more vigorous in defending democracy in Albania."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Füle, Mr Lajčák, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing did not begin on 21 January."
"Therefore, we need to ask ourselves and I am also asking you: Why did the Commission and the other international bodies not put out the fire when the flames first appeared in mid 2009?"
"The 2009 elections were the best that have so far taken place in Albania and they were based on election legislation which, amazingly, was adopted following a consensus between the socialists and democrats."
"Reaching a consensus is something entirely new in Albania."
"I believe that this is important."
"All the socialist election boards, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the election observers and we ourselves believed that the elections were managed correctly."
"The government which was subsequently formed was also something new for Albania."
"Two parties which cannot stand each other sat down and worked together."
"The democratic party, on the one hand, and the smaller social democratic party, on the other."
"Two opposing groups have come together to help Albania to make progress."
"It has joined NATO and it has a visa regime, but unfortunately, it has not yet been granted candidate status."
"However, just at the moment when the government was formed, the opposition decided that the elections had not been properly conducted and called for the ballot boxes to be opened."
"What sort of government opens ballot boxes?"
"Not the sort that we have in my country or in yours."
"We have to go before the constitutional court or the election commission."
"Protests like the ones which we have seen, the hunger strikes, and the refusal to cooperate in Parliament to pass important legislation, are all simply unacceptable."
"It is important that we make this clear and that we face the facts."
"It is not always possible to bring everything onto the same level."
"I would like to find out what the most important and the most difficult issues are."
"The accusations that have been made both recently and right from the beginning concerned the issue of opening the ballot boxes."
"This is not possible, because the constitution does not allow it."
"How can negotiations take place about this if it is not allowed?"
"Now the situation has escalated and four people have been killed."
"It is good that you have attempted today to present a road map."
"However, it may be exaggerating slightly to describe it in that way."
"I would very much like Mr Lajčák and you, Mr Füle, to use this road map to draw up a route towards a better future for the people of the country."
"Mr President, I welcome the statement by the Commissioner."
"I would also like to emphasise the contribution made by Mr Lajčák in trying to identify solutions for overcoming the dramatic situation."
"The recent demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt were certainly opposed by the local dictators who finally had to leave their country - but without major violence and executions like those in Tirana as witnessed by the media."
"As for Prime Minister Berisha's allegations that the demonstrations were nothing more than a coup d'état led by the Opposition, the President of Albania, the Prosecutor General and the head of the secret services - all appointed under Mr Berisha's leadership - are these people all now Socialists or is something wrong with Mr Berisha?"
"I would like here to quote Thomas Countryman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the US Department of State, who publicly rejected the hypothesis that what happened on 24 January was a coup d'état."
"We need to be committed and as effective as the United States and NATO right now in trying to push, assist and help the two Albanian sides reach a negotiated solution, but I also call on all my colleagues who are giving Mr Berisha their unconditional support to stop their one-sided approach."
"It is important to put pressure on both sides so that the two blocs finally reach a solution."
"Up until now, only one side has shown some readiness to implement both the European Parliament resolution and the 12 proposals you mentioned before, Commissioner."
"I call on the Commission to be strong and committed towards an agreement based on the European Parliament resolution and the 12 conditions you mentioned before, bearing in mind that without complete agreement from both sides, Albania's European integration process might be completely frozen."
"(IT) Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for the road map he has set out for Albania this evening, which I endorse wholeheartedly."
"I am totally convinced that this country has a European future and should therefore be a candidate for accession."
"The bloodshed of 21 January dragged Tirana backwards by several years."
"It felt like we were watching the same scenes of protest and violence seen in the 1990s."
"I am therefore very concerned about the recent events and the short-term future of the country."
"During our last visit there in November 2010, in our capacity as the Delegation for South-East Europe and, on 3 and 4 May 2010, as the Stabilisation and Association Parliamentary Committee, together with other colleagues, I witnessed Albania's difficulties with my own eyes."
"We did not manage to bring the negotiations to a close with a final resolution for an agreement."
"Is it possible that we failed to address the country's true problems?"
"Aside from mere political alchemy, was the true social cancer of unemployment even mentioned?"
"We need to recover our sense of responsibility, which is what we are crying out for."
"On this issue, in searching for at least some convergence on basic rules from both the majority and the opposition, it is necessary to guarantee, in all possible ways, that the next round of elections is hallmarked by the highest possible level of transparency and democracy."
"Mayor Edi Rama will stand in elections for the district of Tirana, so we will shortly have the chance to check and assess the political situation and standard of democracy, as naturally, we shall be present there."
"Irrespective of the progress made by Albania in this period, Europe must never stop searching for dialogue and collaboration."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for the work he has carried out and will continue to carry out, because our presence in Albania is important."
"(EL) Mr President, I have been following events in Albania with a great deal of concern."
"The tragic incidents during the demonstration held against corruption, with people killed in clashes with the security forces, must be expressly condemned."
"The continuing political crisis harbours very serious dangers to the stability of the country."
"Everyone bears their share of responsibility."
"However, the elected government should listen to the message being sent by the people, that the country needs sound governance."
"The creation of rule of law, by stamping out corruption, should be one of the Albanian government's priorities."
"The people are entitled to demonstrate within the limits of the law when they feel that the government is acting against their interests."
"The European Union must do whatever it can to help ensure that calm and caution prevail."
"We must all be involved in this process."
"I call on my fellow Members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) not to overlook the government's serious responsibilities and blame the opposition alone for the political crisis."
"At this stage, I think that political dialogue should be resumed and that a solution should be found using the procedures laid down in the constitution and by law."
"(MT) Mr President, when I look at what is happening in Albania, it saddens me greatly because I recall my country's own history in the beginning of the eighties, thirty years ago that is, when Malta was facing a similar situation: deep division, tension, political rivalry, threats and even violence."
"It was a suffocating atmosphere that did not make me proud of my homeland."
"In the same way, I believe that Albanian citizens are equally saddened by their country's current plight, and are far from proud of what is going on."
"Today, I am deeply proud of my country, because we have created a stable, democratic system, and above all, we are now part of the European family."
"The political environment has changed drastically."
"My wish for Albania is the achievement of its aim of having a stable country that is part of the European family."
"However, it is clear that if the two main parties in the country persist in their stubbornness then this aim will never be achieved."
"It is a pity, but it is a reality."
"The European Union is doing what it can; the Visa requirement for Albanians has now been removed."
"Nonetheless, Albania must also play its part, and for this to happen, then all the parties concerned, including the government and the opposition, have to adopt a different policy, one that embraces politics based on dialogue, on maturity and on responsibility towards the Albanian people; politics that do not seek to divide, but to unite."
"It is not up to us to tell the Albanians and Albania what to do."
"We are here to tell them that the decision on whether Albania is to find its place within the European family is in their hands."
"(SV) Mr President, though the crisis in Albania has been going on for a long time, it is only now that it has really started to escalate, and this time, the EU has acted immediately and in the right way."
"Through the commitment of Commissioner Füle and others, the EU has shown that Albania does not have to face its problems alone."
"This is a major problem that is damaging the country's credibility as one that is serious about drawing closer to the EU."
"It is not a question of who is right and who is wrong, but of the need to put the political dialogue back into the domain of the political institutions."
"We should not give our backing to any side as being right or wrong, and we must be extremely clear that the election in May must be a signal as to the direction Albania is going to take - towards the EU or towards continued isolation."
"(LT) Mr President, I share the concern expressed by my fellow Members that the situation in Albania is worrying and may have a negative impact not just on Albania itself, but the future prospects of countries throughout the entire Balkan region."
"At the end of last year, the European Union expressed its confidence that Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina were making and could make progress initiating important reforms, and liberalised the visa regime for their citizens."
"However, the political unrest that began scarcely a few months later and resulted in several deaths suggests that Albania has failed this test."
"This eruption of violence in Albania calls for a rethink of long-term prospects for the region's integration, because European Union policy is concentrated on regional stability and such an approach is right."
"There should therefore be solidarity between the countries of the Balkan region and it should be in their common interest to maintain and promote greater regional integration and political stability."
"(RO) Mr President, the tense situation which developed in Albania at the end of January highlights how important it is to maintain certain boundaries in political debate."
"The extreme escalation of the disputes between the government and opposition has resulted in the loss of human life."
"I need to stress that in a democratic state, these conflicts should not go beyond parliament's walls."
"The street is no place for them."
"The assault by organised opposition groups against the government's building in an attempt to take power by force is a serious matter, while the ploy used by some authorities to hide those who are guilty is unacceptable."
"This is why I am calling on the leaders of the Albanian opposition to return to the discussion process in parliament."
"The elections held in 2009 were fair and it is the political parties' duty to respect the will of the people."
"Compromising state institutions is not the answer for expressing one's convictions or discontent."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to make the following observation: it is most surprising that, while growth indicators for Albania are constantly rising, with growth exceeding 2% in 2010, in the midst of global economic instability, and expected to reach 3% in 2011, social tension is, nonetheless, getting worse rather than better."
"Obviously, Commissioner, growth has not instilled a feeling of prosperity in the Albanian people."
"On the contrary, it is equally obvious that disappointment - and with it the fear of a new wave of immigration to neighbouring countries - is increasing."
"We experienced this very acutely in Greece in the 1990s."
"At this difficult juncture, therefore, Europe has a duty, in addition to giving Albania political advice, to pass on practices and examples, so that growth benefits all sections of society."
"The situation in which Albania finds itself is best described as a cold civil war."
"Political parties play the role of warring sides and are pulling the country into a downward spiral."
"The explanation is that both left and right believe that political parties should rule exclusively, as the Communist Party once did."
"Once a polarisation of this kind has begun, it is very difficult to transform the situation into one that resembles the democratic norm, because in this context, exclusive power is completely rational, which is tragic."
"Is there a way out?"
"Yes: catharsis."
"But only a major crisis or a grand historic compromise can bring this about."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for this lovely debate and, before I share with you my concluding remarks, let me address the two questions which were put during the debate."
"The first one, put forward by Mr Belder, I will answer in written form, taking into account our primary focus in today's discussion."
"But there was another question: whether we are considering sanctions."
"No we are not."
"Why is this?"
"Because in issues of enlargement, conditionality works very fairly, as is clearly the case here."
"If you fulfil the conditions, you are allowed to proceed with accession and eventually join the European Union."
"If you do not fulfil the conditions and requirements, the process is slowed down and eventually stopped."
"Unfortunately, this is the ultimate price that is being paid not only by the politicians but also by the citizens of that respective country."
"The High Representative and I will continue to strive to facilitate dialogue between Albania's majority and opposition."
"We have a clear idea of how to do this."
"We also need your support to make sure that the leaders of the main opposition party and the prime minister of Albania understand our message."
"This could lead the country out of the political crisis and could allow positive steps towards its integration into Europe."
"The European Union made a commitment to all the Western Balkan countries that they would enter the European Union."
"We stand by our commitment and will step up our efforts, provided the countries fulfil the criteria."
"Albania urgently needs to implement the 12 key priorities of the opinion."
"These include addressing the fundamental principles of democracy, such as the proper functioning of Parliament, separation of powers, the conduct of elections and respect for the rule of law."
"All of this will only be possible once the current political situation has taken a fundamental positive turn with the resumption of a full and constructive political dialogue in Parliament, respect for all State institutions and the realisation that the citizens of Albania have aspirations that require attention."
"The leaders of Albania must act now for the benefit of their people."
"The European Union stands ready to assist."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The crisis under way in Albania, which is jeopardising geopolitical stability in the Balkans, is causing acute concern and alarm."
"The political standoff between the government and the opposition is calling Albania's European prospects into question and President Sali Berisha has no intention of stepping down."
"Although few parallels can be drawn between Albania and recent developments in North Africa, what they do have in common are poverty, unemployment, a corrupt, clientelist regime and a lack of democracy."
"Although the crisis in Albania has been temporarily averted, we need to work closely with Albania in order to smooth out the political situation."
"The Commission should explain how it intends to safeguard the rights of Greeks and other minorities in Albania, through the smooth, democratic operation of the system, and to strengthen Frontex on the Greek-Albanian border, given the danger of an influx of immigrants into Greece due to the political unrest."
"Also, the Commission should take serious account of the fact that Albanian nationals no longer require a visa to travel to Turkey, which makes it easier to breach the southern borders of Europe from there, starting with Greece as the first port of call, followed by the rest of Europe."
"Eavesdropping scandal in Bulgaria (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the eavesdropping scandal in Bulgaria."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me stress that EU law protects the confidentiality of electronic communications."
"It prohibits listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communications without the consent of the users concerned."
"Apart from the legally authorised recording of certain communications in the course of lawful business practice such as commercial transactions, further interception practice, such as wiretapping, is subject to specific conditions."
"The conditions for exceptional interception practice must be provided by legislation and be necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society to safeguard public objectives, such as public security or combating criminal offences."
"The general principles of EU law must also be respected."
"For the Commission, Bulgarian legislation seems to comply with these requirements."
"The Law on Special Investigative Means and the Law on Electronic Communications already provide appropriate mechanisms for legal authorisation, oversight, handling and access to personal data, and thus ensure respect of fundamental rights."
"The issue at stake here concerns the enforcement of legal obligations."
"It is the responsibility of the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that legal and procedural guarantees enshrined in the Bulgarian legislation on Special Investigative Means are respected."
"The Commission highlights the necessity for Member States to respect fundamental rights and procedural guarantees in compliance with the rule of law when implementing EU law."
"The Commission understands that the Bulgarian authorities took the necessary steps to check the legality of the deployment of Special Investigative Means and to establish whether the information published in the press resulted from abusive use of Special Investigative Means."
"The Commission, while not having received any related complaints on the interception of electronic communications in Bulgaria, will continue to monitor the current situation with a view to ensuring compliance with EU law."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I am very surprised by this debate, which was not even raised in the competent committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, before it came here."
"The measure which is being attacked in this debate is a legitimate legal instrument which can be used in the fight against crime."
"If anything, it is proof that Bulgaria is serious in taking up the great challenge of fighting corruption and organised crime, which is something we have long asked it to do."
"The measures foreseen in the law can be exercised in a legitimate manner and we expect them to be exercised in a legitimate manner."
"The law foresees that phone tapping can only be requested by public prosecutors or by law enforcement agencies, such as the police and the national security agency, if they suspect that the person in question is involved in criminal activity and after there is authorisation by a judge."
"The law on the use of special intelligence lays down a purpose limitation, stipulating that these measures can only be used for the purpose of fighting organised crime or for protecting national security."
"The information collected must be kept confidential and must only be used for the purposes outlined in the law."
"There is also established parliamentary scrutiny of this legal system."
"So it is clear that there are safeguards, especially safeguards on the privacy of citizens and respect of data protection, and there is no question, as I see it, of it being in breach of the law."
"Therefore, attacking this instrument at this point would be tantamount to an irresponsible attack against the effort of a Member State to try to fight organised crime and corruption."
"This attack damages Bulgaria greatly, as this fight is of utmost importance for this country in the light of its cooperation and verification mechanism and also of its prospective entry into the Schengen area."
"The only plausible explanation for this debate therefore seems to be that it is politically motivated."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I was one of those in this Parliament who strongly promoted the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union."
"I am very happy that Bulgaria is now a Member State, but I am very disappointed at some of the measures taken by the present Bulgarian Government."
"Yes, we fully support the fight against corruption."
"This is a very important fight, and we fully support what the Commission has said that there must be laws in Bulgaria concerning videotaping and interception."
"The Commissioner was very careful."
"He said it seems to comply with European standards and he said very clearly that the measures must be proportionate."
"Is it proportionate when, all of a sudden, in a timeframe of three years, interception grows from 6 000 in 2008 to 16 000 in 2010?"
"Is it proportionate and fair that only 2% of the videotaping is going to the courts and is used for 1% of convictions?"
"Is it proportionate and fair that the proceedings are filtered by the Ministry of the Interior?"
"Why is everything not given to the judicial authorities?"
"Why is it filtered by the Ministry of the Interior?"
"What does the Ministry of the Interior do with what is coming in?"
"I would like to ask the Commission to look into its monitoring process regarding what is happening to the rest of the data."
"There are also reports in the Parliament in Sofia and in the media in Bulgaria that there are serious doubts that the Ministry of the Interior can protect the information."
"We have already seen leakage of the information."
"You mentioned Schengen and, yes, we want the Schengen border extended."
"It now includes Bulgaria and Romania, but when we see what is happening here, you cannot be surprised that some in Europe are critical about this enlargement."
"I would ask the Commissioner to do his job, as he did, and ask the Bulgarian Government to stop this kind of wrong implementation and wrong law enforcement tending towards a very restrictive practice concerning these interceptions."
"Be fair, be open, be transparent and stop violations of this kind of the spirit of European laws."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(BG) Mr President, Mr Swoboda, I would like to ask you a question."
"You cited data from 2008 and 2010."
"Would you tell me where you got these figures from, and do you believe them to be correct?"
"You stated that only one or two percent are used in court."
"The data circulating in Bulgaria are quite different, and the figures regarding the number of people who were actually eavesdropped and the percentage of data used as evidence in court are completely different."
"For 2009, they were 30%, and in 2010, they were 40%."
"In other words, the figures differ completely from those you cited just now."
"Mr President, we have received different figures from Bulgarian sources."
"Perhaps it should be left up to the Commission to prove who is right."
"As far as I know from sources in Bulgaria, there is a very low percentage of referrals to prosecutors, of which very few lead to convictions."
"This is what we know; this is the information we have from various sources."
"There is also, I think, a report from the parliament in Bulgaria."
"The Commission should look into that."
"Why is there this scandal in Bulgaria?"
"We really have to look into this matter."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(BG) Mr President, just a quick question, Mr Swoboda."
"Are you aware that the investigation which you just mentioned as being with the Ministry of the Interior was moved there from the judicial authorities when the Bulgarian Socialist Party, which is part of your group, was in power?"
"Mr President, it always seems to be a party political issue for Mr Stoyanov and Mr Busuttil."
"For me, it is not a party political issue."
"For me, it is a basic issue of rights, of human rights, and of obeying and respecting European law, regardless of who transferred it to the Ministry of the Interior."
"Secondly, the important thing is how it is used."
"You can use the same instrument in a very restricted way, or you can use it in a very wide way."
"As I said before, it is very interesting what is done with the data kept by the Ministry of the Interior."
"That is the major issue."
"There is always the danger that when so much data is kept and not given to the prosecutors, that it will be misused."
"This may be politically motivated or it may be personally motivated."
"We should fight against this kind of misuse."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for your very careful statement."
"Those in this Parliament who know me and know the 12 years I have spent here will know that I intervene in such debates with a great reticence."
"But over a year ago, as a Vice-President of this Parliament, I was asked to visit Bulgaria to speak about the Stockholm Programme for Justice."
"It is clear that our programme for justice has moved from an emphasis on security to an emphasis on justice, and all of us in our Member States have to get that balance right."
"I remember from my visit to Bulgaria the great interest of Bulgarian judges in what we are doing and want to pursue at Union level."
"But I was surprised last week to receive a visitor in my office in Brussels who spoke about people in Bulgaria receiving visits from the secret service in their homes at night."
"This is something that is totally alien to me and I find it very difficult to understand and to stand here saying this."
"That said, it seems to me, as Mr Swoboda has already said, that the current legislation that exists on phone tapping - let us call it what it is - appears to be correct."
"Where there was formerly scrutiny by an independent body, there is now scrutiny by a parliamentary body."
"Has that led to a lessening of the regard for rights?"
"There does seem to be an increase in the numbers and an increase in the numbers seems to indicate, and I underline 'seems', that there is an easier or a quicker granting by judges of this possibility."
"Part of the reason I want to speak is a linked matter which relates to the citizen's initiative."
"It appears that people feel that they are being pressurised to withdraw signatures."
"We have to implement the European Citizens' Initiative over the course of the next year."
"I would ask the Commission to watch this space very carefully."
"Mr President, the use of special forms of surveillance is a sensitive issue in any country."
"We often encounter suspicions that the government is using them not only in the fight against organised crime, but also to monitor and suppress political opposition."
"The situation in Bulgaria, however, is particularly strange."
"Information obtained by listening in on telephone conversations under dubious conditions is not ending up with the relevant bodies, but is appearing in various media."
"The Bulgarian premier has even announced that the highest representatives of the State are also constantly bugged by the secret service."
"Apparently, this is for the fight against corruption and organised crime."
"Well, it does not often happen that a Head of Government admits that he has such great faith in his closest colleagues that he has to have them bugged so that they do not surrender to the temptation of corruption or collaborating with organised crime."
"In any case, there is a peculiar situation in this area in Bulgaria, and I think it would be good to assist our Bulgarian friends in sorting matters out regarding the application of the relevant legislation."
"(BG) Mr President, in Bulgaria, we have a saying for what we are witnessing in the current debate: 'the thief who cries 'thief!''."
"When the tripartite coalition was in power, the services were infiltrated by the mafia, with the toxic results that we now see."
"When the coalition was in power, I myself was beaten by the police during an opposition protest."
"Afterwards, these wolves in sheep's clothing, who now present themselves to you as fighters against a police state, amended the law by virtue of which the case against my assailants has been pending in the court for three years now."
"During your rule, socialists and royalists, the police attacked peaceful demonstrators, but now you are stirring up a fuss about infringements of civil liberties."
"When you were in power, the journalist Ognyan Stefanov was beaten to death, and now you complain of censorship."
"While you were in power, kidnappings were a daily occurrence."
"The mafia was all-powerful, while citizens had no rights."
"The courts were bought and sold."
"When you were in power, wheeler-dealing and selling off national assets became models of rule."
"Now you are up to your old tricks again, trying to stop Bulgaria joining Schengen in the hope that you can blame the sins of your criminal rule on others."
"However, it will not work, because the voters are not blind."
"They swept you from power, threw you on to the political scrapheap, and no iniquity that you may dream up will change this fact."
"(BG) Mr President, every debate in the European Parliament reflects the interests of European citizens."
"Today's debate, however, can serve as a good example of how the European scene can become a tool for selfish, national political interests."
"Every time the European agenda is subverted by a national agenda, this cannot be interpreted as a position of national responsibility but as being in conflict with the values for which Bulgarian citizens voted their representatives into the European Parliament."
"Would they recognise themselves in this debate?"
"I doubt it."
"My fellow MEPs are undoubtedly right when they say that the Bulgarian public must know what is going on in its own country and whether its constitutional rights are being observed."
"However, there is a limit beyond which democratic institutions are ignored to protect the interest of dubious interest groups whose purpose is clear: to discredit Bulgaria on its road to Europe and to discredit the government of GERB in its attempts to put an end to shady practices that have been allowed to build up for many years."
"I would like to draw your attention to some of the things my fellow Members have expressed."
"First of all, the assertion that the number of cases of eavesdropping has doubled."
"The official figures are completely different."
"They are publicly available to anyone who cares about the truth."
"However, I would like to ask a question."
"Since when has this information been transparent?"
"There is only one answer: thanks to the GERB government, which regards transparency and free access by citizens to State information as a fundamental principle."
"Secondly, the assertion that closing the bureau set up to control eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria has put an end to legal control over their use is completely unfounded."
"I would like to remind you that this bureau never has worked properly, particularly as the original idea for it came from the executive authorities."
"You do not need reminding that Bulgaria is a parliamentary republic, and the special sub-committee for parliamentary control and monitoring of the procedures for authorising, applying and using eavesdropping devices was set up within the very framework of respect for democratic institutions and the constitution."
"I would also like to remind you that all political parties are represented on the sub-committee and represented according to the principle of parity."
"Furthermore, the ruling party is not entitled to chair the committee."
"All of this shows that the Bulgarian legislator has incorporated absolute guarantees for carrying out such lawful activities, and these are backed up by reliable controls."
"Changing the status quo is difficult; building something positive is even more so."
"Most difficult, however, is when some of our country's representatives come to the most democratic institution of Europe to embroil themselves in internal polemics whose aims are far removed from those we uphold here every day."
"Mr President, it is always uncomfortable when any Member State has its internal situation scrutinised."
"I want to say, in the same spirit that Mrs Wallis indicated, that my own government in the United Kingdom was investigated for its operation of rendition - taking people to be tortured allegedly."
"This, of course, was very uncomfortable for me and for my government in the United Kingdom, but I took part actively in that investigation because it was necessary to do it in a European-wide way."
"Why?"
"And why are we here today discussing the internal interception arrangements of the Bulgarian Government?"
"Not because of Bulgaria, but because we are a community of values."
"As a community of values, the issue is that raised by the Commissioner - I quote, 'that interception must be used exceptionally'."
"While not a great lawyer like Mrs Wallis, I am a lawyer, and I know that you must only use interception exceptionally."
"It is one of those things which, if used in an unnecessary, inappropriate or disproportionate way, instead of becoming an aid to the attack on organised crime, which is very important in Bulgaria and elsewhere in the European Union, becomes a weapon of the state."
"It does not matter which political party is originating this debate, to move from discussing an attack on organised crime to using an instrument of the State disproportionately is a very serious matter for the European Union and it is not exclusive today to Bulgaria."
"Tomorrow, it may be another Member State."
"I genuinely looked into all the sources and figures, and I would ask colleagues across the parties in this House: is there anyone who is saying that an inappropriate or disproportionate use of interception was or was not used?"
"If you want to dispute the figures used by Mr Swoboda, is anyone disputing that a disproportionate use of interception has happened?"
"I have looked at many sources before speaking today, because we have to speak carefully about such issues."
"I have not seen anyone on any side of the debate saying disproportionate use has not happened."
"For that reason, the Commission must investigate this."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as an Italian citizen, I am certainly not against wiretapping when it is used legally."
"In Italy, it is very useful for combating the Mafia and recently, it has been used to incriminate President Berlusconi for the alleged crimes of bribery and underage prostitution."
"The case of the Bulgarian Government appears to be completely different, since it seems that it was using wiretapping to criminalise the opposition, causing widespread fear in complex societal organisations and attempting to link the opposition to common criminals -which allows it to act with no respect for human rights and to install a police state."
"Situations like this can only lead to further social violence."
"I therefore believe that Parliament and the European Commission need to pay particular attention to the situation in Bulgaria and seek to limit the damage that the behaviour of its government threatens to cause."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, I have followed this debate and the debate on Albania very closely."
"What a difference!"
"In that debate, efforts were made to maintain a polite, friendly tone across party boundaries."
"Here, insinuations have been made which are completely unproven."
"There, the aim was to bring the two major parties together."
"Here, the objective of one of them is to drive a wedge between the two parties."
"There, the desire was for the two parties to come together and work together for the welfare of the people."
"Here, it is unfortunately all about one part of Parliament prejudging the situation."
"Why are you doing this?"
"Why have I not heard you state a single fact?"
"You have just used phrases such as 'It seems to be the case ... ' or 'We have been informed by certain sources ... ' or 'We have heard that ... '."
"If that is how you see the situation, why do you not go to the relevant committees in Parliament?"
"Why do you not go to the Subcommittee on Security and Defence?"
"Why do you not ask the Commission questions?"
"Instead, you are pushing for a public debate because you want it to take place for political reasons."
"We are opposed to this."
"We do not understand why this debate is taking place at the expense of the Bulgarian Government and the Bulgarian people."
"If there is something which needs to be discussed, I invite you to do so in the relevant committees."
"It goes without saying for us that there must be the rule of law, a functioning justice system and appropriate parliamentary controls, in particular, in the case of sensitive issues like this instrument, all of which are the responsibility of a parliament which has been put in place by this government, which consists of representatives of all the parliamentary parties."
"I am grateful to Mrs Malmström for saying last week in Sofia that this is an internal matter and to the Commissioner for stating clearly that the Bulgarian Government has taken all the necessary steps."
"Mr President, on a point of order, there was a guy up there filming us, including when we were signing."
"He says he is from the Bulgarian Delegation."
"I do not know how that can be, as all the Bulgarian Members seem to be here."
"It is very strange that somebody has come into the Chamber and filmed us while we were speaking and signing."
"Perhaps the services could look into what has happened, because it is unacceptable for outsiders to come in here and film what we are doing."
"Yes, Mr Swoboda, I will enquire about this, and we will take steps as necessary."
"(BG) Mr President, today's debate is not just about widespread eavesdropping in Bulgaria."
"It is about the alarming tendencies towards the suspension of citizens' rights in Europe"
"Internal political problems are the responsibility of the competent authorities in Bulgaria, who have to refer the issues to themselves to resolve them."
"At European level, there are no flaws in harmonisation with European legislation and, you are right, Commissioner; the problems lie in the implementation."
"For that reason, we asked you what you would do to ensure there is no abuse of European law."
"Therefore, my answer to you too, Mr Strasser, is that we have referred it to the Commission."
"The Bulgarian scandal has put the Charter, the Stockholm Programme, Directive 9546 and numerous documents on data protection in jeopardy, because in Bulgaria, recorded conversations of doctors are made public without legal justification and with no opportunity for a legal defence."
"The drastic increase in eavesdropping devices is in inverse proportion to their judicial effectiveness."
"Doubts remain that the information from them will be collected and used for political purposes, which is particularly dangerous comes the elections in a year's time."
"Commissioner, we urge the Commission to issue an initiative for the establishment of independent bodies to control eavesdropping devices in Member States."
"These devices are very important in fighting corruption and criminality, and that is why we are appealing to you to ensure that they are lawfully used in the context of the mechanism for verification and cooperation."
"(BG) Mr President, the escalation in the use of special eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria is a fact, which is why the public is so excited and concerned."
"It was the Bulgarian parliamentary control body that came up with the critical findings."
"I ask the Commission to familiarise itself with these findings."
"There are other important issues."
"Will the Commission send a signal to those who are unaware of the fine line between security and freedom?"
"Will the Commission convict the people who use the tools of the state for party political and even personal interests?"
"Moreover, how categorically will the Commission exhort a national parliament - not necessarily the Bulgarian parliament - to resolve the issue of legislative gaps and to reinstate any independent control bodies it has closed down?"
"It has become clear that clandestinely gathered information has been shared not only within the confines of the special services, but with political figures in the hierarchy of the security services; that field operatives filter information, which is not their job by law; that eavesdropping devices are frequently used on spurious technical grounds and probably for no good reason."
"Unfortunately, the Bulgarian special services, embroiled as they are in the fight against crime, have developed a basic reflex of watching almost anything that breathes and moves."
"It is not surprising that respected magistrates - not politicians, note - claim that either the system is flawed or there is a deliberate policy of regression."
"Flawed ought to be repaired, and that is what we are fighting for now."
"However, when it comes to deliberate steps backward, I think we should all oppose it and proclaim that the core of the European political philosophy is human rights, freedoms and the sanctity of human life."
"The Stockholm Programme has not been consigned to the museum."
"It demands that we turn Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, and we must not allow individuals, parties or governments to take any Member State back to a dark age of repression, injustice and uncertainty."
"(BG) Mr President, what we heard from the Commission confirms the fact that Bulgarian legislation regarding the use of eavesdropping devices conforms with European law."
"We cannot be different because each Member State is obliged to guarantee its citizens fundamental rights and to observe the legal procedures, which is what Bulgaria does."
"So what is it that has provoked the debate in this House today?"
"The answer is simple."
"An election campaign is under way in Bulgaria and the Bulgarian opposition has brought the fight to the European Parliament, obviously irrespective of whether it discredits Bulgaria or not and for the sole purpose of extracting political dividends which, I assure you, is doubtful in the extreme."
"It must be hard for the European institutions to convince themselves of the good intentions of representatives of the former tripartite coalition in Bulgaria, during whose rule there were plenty of examples of corruption, an unwillingness to fight crime and lack of confidence on the part of the European Union."
"The fellow Members who initiated this debate have clearly lost the patience to wait for the Commission's answers, and wanted the debate to be held prior to the interim report on Bulgaria's progress under the Mechanism for Verification and Cooperation."
"I would like to make a little joke here."
"My fellow Members are obviously guided by high-minded patriotic ideas of doing as much damage to the Bulgarian Government as possible."
"It is a disgrace that in this empty, half-empty, or practically empty hall, we Bulgarians are at each other's throats."
"Instead of working together in the interests of our citizens, we are dealing with hearsay, manipulations and a war of political mud-slinging."
"Bulgaria's present government is under attack from the old status quo, the remnants of the communist regime in the structures of power and those who illegally enriched themselves during the period of transition."
"The aim of this united front is not just to destabilise Bulgaria and to halt GERB's efforts for a fairer society, but to discredit our country in the eyes of our European partners."
"I repeat: what is happening here this evening is pitiful and disgraceful."
"This clearly smacks of the envy of those circles, both political and economic, with the government's success in its uncompromising war against criminality and corruption, and with its honest and open way of conducting policy."
"In recent days, fellow Members of the Bulgarian opposition have presented the situation in Bulgaria in the darkest possible terms."
"They talk of fear, a police state, repressions, hunger, poverty, regression, as we just heard and so forth."
"Bulgaria's reputation is being tarnished for the sake of short-term political gains."
"The very opposite is true."
"There are no contract killings or kidnappings, organised crime has been dealt a severe blow and the channels of corruption which benefited the circles of the old status quo, not just economically but also politically, have been cut off."
"The country is stable at the macro-economic level, and offers some of the best conditions for investment in Europe."
"The government is stable, the Bulgarian parliament enjoys a stable majority, it governs openly and is a respected and worthy European partner."
"Finally, I would like to once again apologise to my fellow MEPs from other Member States who are here, for wasting their time in this, unfortunately, very Bulgarian pre-election debate."
"(RO) Mr President, the use of illegal phone tapping and eavesdropping in Bulgaria is an extremely serious situation."
"What is more serious still is that it is not the only case of this kind in the European Union."
"Commissioner, this debate ought to have been held about another Member State as well, namely, Romania."
"In Romania in 2011, we have the situation where eavesdropping on private discussions is carried out without any legal remit, even though the constitution, national laws and EU legislation impose a total ban on any kind of intrusion of a person's privacy without having sound justification and explicit authorisation from a judge."
"Discussions are being recorded illegally between journalists, politicians, as well as internal discussions during opposition parties' meetings or private meetings in courtrooms."
"The fundamental right to the protection of privacy is being systematically and repeatedly violated."
"Illegal phone tapping has become prosecutors' investigation method of choice."
"The secret services permanently monitor the telephone conversations of the current government's political opponents."
"This is a very serious situation and I call on the European Commission to intervene urgently to uphold the rule of law and democracy in both Member States."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to repeat the European Commission's assessment that the present government of Bulgaria is showing a real ambition to crack down on organised crime."
"Hardly anybody will deny that for the first time, our country has made real progress on this."
"That is what the Bulgarian electorate voted for in 2009."
"The results have been achieved thanks to the decisive actions of the law enforcement agencies, which mustered all legal crime detection methods."
"It is only natural for the number of operations - and hence the number of people investigated - to increase, resulting in greater effectiveness."
"However, let us not be naïve."
"Organised crime has plenty of resources to hand, acquired over years of impunity and inaction, to cause an unprecedented response."
"They have activated the machinery of undermining the ruling coalition to discredit it in the very area in which it is strongest."
"The campaign was kicked off by publishing carefully selected and manipulated wire-tap recordings disseminated on flash drives by persons unknown."
"The media and politicians are falling over each other to comment on the horrors going on in Bulgaria, on the threat to citizens, on how much fundamental conventions and declarations have been undermined."
"Those who initiated this hysteria, those who acquired and illegally spread this discrediting information, are now rubbing their hands with glee."
"They probably did not even imagine how easily the bait would be taken, to the extent that even the 4x4 in which the flash drives were being transported was stolen."
"Some of the politicians present here have managed to spread this hysteria to the European Parliament, presenting it as the Bulgarian eavesdropping scandal."
"No such scandal exists in Bulgaria."
"All there is is a well-organised offensive to discredit the country's ruling coalition and its most prominent figures."
"Discredited politicians from the opposition parties jumped on this bandwagon, hoping to reap dividends in the coming election campaign."
"May we ask my fellow Members whether they are aware of whose hands they are playing into by their present actions?"
"(BG) Mr President, I would like to turn to Commissioner Piebalgs, because a great deal of propaganda has been coming from Bulgaria's ruling party today."
"The Parliamentary Commission, headed by the ruling party's coalition partner, the nationalists of Ataka, presented the Bulgarian parliament with a report saying that the government is filtering information acquired from wiretaps before passing it on to the courts."
"The report states that the government does not protect confidential personal information, which is published in the media."
"The report also says - and, I repeat, the report was prepared by the Bulgarian parliament - that fundamental rights of people living in Bulgaria, who are likewise European citizens, are being broken."
"This is an infringement of a number of European directives."
"It is an infringement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I also believe that the only option left open to the Commission is to compare Bulgarian law and its implementation with what the requirements are for all European citizens."
"This is not a question of propaganda or a party political campaign."
"It is a question of clear facts and we believe that the Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, will familiarise itself with them and issue its opinion."
"(BG) Mr President, as I am among the last to take the floor in this debate, I would like to summarise by saying a few words."
"Today's debate is not to do with special eavesdropping devices in Bulgaria, nor is it a debate for or against a particular minister."
"It is a debate on the principles and values of Europe, which is why it is only natural that it should be held in this House."
"That is because it is a matter of freedom, of human rights, of democratic laws, which is not and cannot be purely a domestic debate."
"The debate on human rights is the philosophy of a unified Europe, the purpose that inspired the new democracies after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"If they lose their faith that Europe is based on principles, many of their citizens will decide that the road to Europe, which has been so long and hard, was a futile exercise."
"Today's debate is about the truth."
"The truth cannot be right-wing or left-wing."
"There can be no half-truths."
"There is always one truth, and we urge the institutions responsible in Bulgaria to name it as soon as possible."
"Because, deliberately or not, the more they delay their answer, the more they feed into the iniquitous soil of rumour and, in that way, are only serving those who claim to be fighting it."
"Today's debate is also one about the responsibility - not of past or future governments, but of the present one."
"What distinguishes democratic governments is the fact that they are always responsible to their electorates, regardless of whether they supported or opposed them."
"Equating the opposition with organised crime is the device of a different form of governance which has nothing to do with democracy."
"(BG) Mr President, after everything I have heard so far, all I can say is that we have, unfortunately, yet again been witness to a pitiful performance put on by the Bulgarian opposition to bring a domestic political debate to the European Parliament."
"Those who initiated this debate, the socialists and liberals who, for eight years, ruled our country, obviously want to use every opportunity to publicly destroy Bulgaria's image before our European partners."
"Today's argument will not solve who is right and who is wrong, but what will be remembered is the acrimony of our debate, our accusations against one another."
"I appeal to you, fellow MEPs of the opposition: if you cannot act as a constructive counterbalance to the present Bulgarian Government, if you cannot focus on constructive, expert, consensual proposals on how to improve standards for Bulgarian citizens, at least do not get in the way of those who can do so."
"Mr President, I was not intending to take the floor now under the catch-the-eye procedure, but was denied the right to raise the blue card."
"I wanted to respond to Mr Strasser."
"(BG) First of all, Mr Strasser, I would like to say that I cannot agree that there is no information on how eavesdropping devices have been used."
"According to information from the Supreme Court of Cassation, in 2010, 15 946 wiretapping warrants were issued, while only 1 918 were used in court, which is 12% of the total."
"As you can see, the remaining wiretaps were clearly used for other purposes."
"16 000 eavesdropping devices means that before 2010, between 5% and 10% of Bulgarian citizens were wiretapped, directly or indirectly."
"I would like to ask you, Mr Strasser, is that what you did in Austria?"
"Would you agree to your interior ministry and prosecutor's office behaving this way in Austria?"
"Moreover, do you not believe that this debate is a debate on the principle of what the state of freedom and democracy is in a Member State of the European Union?"
"It is my view that these questions have to be debated here, because obviously we do not have the strength to do so in Bulgaria."
"(BG) Mr President, I would like to ask the European Commission whether it is aware of the fact that there have been 27 rulings against Bulgaria at the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for misuse of police powers."
"Today, we are discussing eavesdropping devices, but the Citizens' Initiative has also been watched by the State Agency for National Security and people have been forced to withdraw their signatures."
"People taking part in peaceful demonstrations on economic issues have afterwards been summoned to the police and questioned."
"Show arrests have been carried out with deliberate heavy-handedness."
"The declaration of the ruling political party claims that the opposition, both on the right and the left, have a hand in organised crime and the enemies of GERB are the enemies of the state, while the political and criminal oppositions today are the same thing."
"That is the style used by Mussolini and it concerns me greatly."
"Similarly, pressure was yesterday exerted at an official meeting between my political party and the leadership of GERB to withdraw our oral question, an action which I consider undemocratic and intolerable."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take to restore human rights in my country?"
"This debate today is not a matter of Bulgarians opposing Bulgarians, but Bulgarians in the interest of their state and their citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to speak to you directly."
"I find it regrettable that you do not make use of the blue card when we are all trying to make parliamentary debates more animated."
"It would have significantly improved the quality of this debate."
"If you are not listening to me, Mr President, then I do not need to continue."
"This is simply futile."
"This is what one Member of this House for a long time referred to as a karaoke parliament, where attempts to hold debates and to improve their quality are completely disregarded."
"Mr President, I just wanted to add my voice to those insisting that you pretended not to see the blue cards tonight."
"Since everyone was trying to imply that there are not enough colleagues here, I would like to say that there are indeed enough respectable colleagues listening to the debate."
"I just want to express my disappointment at what Mr Strasser said."
"Really, this was not an example of a good democratic speech from someone from a country which we really respect as a democratic one."
"(LT) Mr President, this really is a rather complex issue."
"Based on the information provided, it is clear that there is a problem."
"I would definitely agree with my colleague who said previously that this is not just a Bulgarian issue."
"It is a question of certain values, European Union values, recognised values and we must all respect anyone who is participating in the debate here in this Chamber."
"There is a certain charter in the European Union called the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Bulgaria, Lithuania, which I myself represent today, and the other European Union Member States must all comply with it."
"It clearly defines what we can and cannot do, and what government can and cannot do."
"However, the fundamental idea is to respect human rights."
"Commissioner, I therefore feel that the representative of the Commission really should follow this case very closely, because the tension felt in this Chamber today is still excessive."
"(BG) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that there will be debates when it comes to fundamental and inalienable European values such as security and human rights, and when the fine line between them is widened."
"Paradoxical though it may appear, the different positions expressed this evening did have one thing in common, and that is concern."
"The European Commission asked the Bulgarian authorities to provide information so it could check whether eavesdropping devices are being used lawfully."
"We liberal and socialist MEPs wanted a debate because of our concern with legality."
"We expressed our opinions to reassure the people who sent us here that we are on the alert for any infringements of their rights."
"In their statements, my fellow Members from the European People's Party have shown concern at poor practices and confidence that they will be improved."
"I hope that in this united role, we will be able to provoke rapid processes which will restore the normal functions of democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a liberal democrat both in Europe and in Italy."
"Sometimes, however, in my country, my fellow party members and I are called communists merely for opposing the current government."
"It seems that the same thing is now happening to our colleagues in Bulgaria, with liberal democrats and socialists being called criminals simply because they represent an opposition force in their country."
"We disapprove of this move, because if it is a joke, then it really should only be a short one."
"Behaviour of this kind can become really dangerous in the end."
"In addition, after everything that has happened in Egypt and Tunisia, only yesterday, the Italian Foreign Minister visited Damascus in Syria and called it 'a democratic country that completely satisfies its citizens' need for modernisation'."
"If our representatives make speeches like this, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to denounce them and the Commission must keep a close watch."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a rather heated debate, but I would like to emphasise three points which I believe are fundamental."
"The accession process to the EU - and my country went through this - is not an easy one, but when a country is accepted into the EU, we really believe that this Member State has the ability to be the guarantor of fundamental human rights and also of the implementation of EU law."
"For this particular sector, we have specific legislation."
"This is the directive concerning the processing of personal data and protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector."
"So, the Commission has a very long and, I would say, a very respectable, track record on following EU legislation being implemented in Member States."
"I reported to you where we start now and I believe that you should have full trust that the Commission will act if EU law is breached."
"If it is not breached, it will not act."
"So the Commission is monitoring the situation and, if there is the need, the Commission will act, but I think we should not go beyond the structures that are in Community law and the Commission will definitely stay within Community law."
"The debate is closed."
"World Bank energy strategy (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Eva Joly, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the World Bank's energy strategy for developing countries - B70012/2011)."
"author. - Mr President, today, 1.5 billion people are currently without access to electricity, but access to energy is a prerequisite for the eradication of the poverty that these people live in."
"The right to energy implies that energy supplies achieve universal and reliable access: equitable access that bridges the gap between urban and rural areas and is also affordable."
"It is also crucial for a country to develop a sustainable and secure energy supply, and the most reliable and secure one is a decentralised use of renewables."
"But energy does not only need to be secure and reliable; its production also needs to take into account other issues such as climate change, deforestation, environmental degradation, human health, and the poverty it causes."
"These problems cannot be tackled by fossil fuels."
"Fossil fuels have a disastrous impact on health, environment and climate."
"At the same time, the climate crisis is doing more damage to those living in extreme poverty."
"Fossil fuels create pollution that endangers both human health and a healthy environment, and they are expensive and their prices increase the more we run out of oil and gas."
"Fossil fuels create centralised, hierarchic and inflexible energy distribution."
"We have to focus on renewables."
"We have to assist developing countries to leapfrog our destructive fossil fuel path."
"Only renewables can bring a solution to these problems."
"Renewable energy uses resources that will never run out and that many developing countries have in abundance: sun and wind mainly."
"They can be employed locally on a very small and inexpensive scale, which is also, in a very literal sense, empowering people."
"Decentralised power supplies are in the hands of the people."
"They are democratic."
"Nevertheless, the World Bank continues to push fossils in its energy strategy."
"Recent increases in lending for renewable and energy sufficiency remain tiny and cannot cover up the obvious preferences."
"Fossil fuel investments are also taking place through financial intermediaries which the World Bank does not sufficiently monitor. There is an under-reporting of fossil fuels."
"The bank continues to make significant investment in coal-fired power plants, locking developing countries into coal-based energy for decades to come."
"This is not what an energy revolution looks like."
"The World Bank's energy policy suffers from a lack of transparency."
"This problem should be addressed through the definition of clear requirements that financial intermediaries must meet in order to be eligible for multilateral financing."
"40% of World Bank loans to the private sector are transferred through those financial intermediaries and a large part of those loans goes to the energy sector, in particular, extractives."
"However, unlike direct bank project investments, there is no information publicly available on these individual sub-project investments, making it very difficult to track what ultimately happens to financial intermediaries' funding."
"When we look at what sort of energy is counted as low carbon, we can find large hydropower plants in the strategy."
"Such large hydroplants destroy vast amounts of nature and drive people from their homes."
"This is not sustainable and this is not in the interests of the people and of society."
"Also, carbon capture and storage do not make coal power low carbon."
"The CO2 is still there and nobody can predict what will happen to it underground."
"None of us can say for sure that it will stay there, calmly for the next millennia."
"This is fortune telling and not research, and certainly not policy making."
"The same goes for nuclear energy."
"Uranium mining produces huge amounts of CO2 and nobody knows what to do with the waste we are producing."
"This is not low carbon and this is not sustainable."
"This is why the Green/EFA Group will vote against the resolution unless the low carbon wording is replaced."
"However, we also see some good points in the resolution: for example, the focus on off-grid renewables for rural areas and small-scale local production, as well as the concern about the dominance of export orientation, large-scale plants and bio fuels."
"A last word: we also very much focus on the call for enhanced technology transfer."
"In particular, technology transfer will not need much if intellectual property rights are left intact."
"The overriding goal should be to treat intellectual property rights in a manner that allows access to technology at affordable prices."
"This is what we promised at the climate negotiations, and we should stick to our promise."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I can only congratulate Ms Keller for what she has said and her analysis."
"The question though is this."
"We have known about these problems for two decades now."
"Ms Keller, since you have dealt with the issue in more depth than most of us, is there any particular point that makes you optimistic that what we are about to decide upon could actually bring some progress, or that the World Bank is now finally heading in the right direction?"
"author. - Mr President, indeed, we have been discussing these issues for more than two decades, and I really hope that the World Bank will learn from these discussions since everybody agrees that the future lies with renewables."
"We have seen a slight change in this strategy."
"For instance, it has moved a bit more towards renewables, but this is a little step and not enough by far."
"There is still too much dominance of fossils and, when it comes to renewables, too much focus on hydropower plants - and they are not renewable, they are not sustainable, not for anybody."
"So I hope that this Parliament can make a strong statement on where we want the European energy policy and the policy that we promote for energy in the world to go."
"I hope for your support to remove the wording on low carbon and go for proper, sustainable, renewable energy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I feel I also made a very strong statement."
"Firstly, I would emphasise that the World Bank energy strategy is very welcome because the World Bank plays a very particular role in the world, particularly in dealing with development issues."
"It is not an understatement to say that they are leaders of public opinion and approaches to development strategies."
"My point is that we should address this issue with all seriousness."
"At the same time, we should not forget a couple of elements that are very crucial when we are estimating our answer to the strategy."
"There are still a substantial number of households today that have no access to any type of energy."
"It is true that, although we have been discussing the issue for 20 years, substantial investment in the energy sector or energy service provision have not been delivered to hundreds of millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa."
"So I believe that we need to understand the scale of the challenge."
"The second point that we need to take into account is growth."
"Each of the countries that are on the path of development have an immense growth in demand."
"We should respond to growth in demand with supply."
"There is an additional fundamental challenge because of the scale of this."
"The third point - and here I fully agree with Ms Keller - is sustainability and anticipation."
"Whatever the energy sector does should be considered in the light of the consequences that it has on climate change."
"We know that the energy sector which exists today is the biggest cause of greenhouse gases."
"Additionally, we should also look at the price of fossil fuel, because we should not forget that the challenge of fossil fuel prices is still ahead of us."
"I hope that we will face this later rather than sooner, but it is definitely part of anticipation of the strategy."
"As for the orientation, I would expect Parliament to take account of the Green Paper on EU development policy, where we make access to renewable energy in developing countries one of the central pillars of the new EU development policy."
"If we do not take this pioneering step, we cannot easily expect to convince the World Bank and others that we should be focusing investment on renewable energy."
"I believe that we are capable of managing the scale of investment in renewable energy."
"We just need to have courage."
"It is true that it requires a lot of financial means today, but any energy strategy would require quite a lot of investment."
"So, if I see anticipation of the prices, I would always argue that renewable energy is definitely the one that should be at the heart of any energy policy in any part of the world."
"Our knowledge of renewable technologies today gives a good guarantee that we really could make a change in these countries."
"I also believe that there is a lot of untapped potential."
"I know that hydropower, for example, is a rather challenging source of energy from all points of view but, provided environmental sustainability analysis is being done, I believe that most countries also have a fantastic untapped potential in hydropower, which gives additional arguments that the scale - the Inga Dam, for example - is huge."
"At the beginning, we need to lead by example."
"If the EU is able and you discuss a report on the EU development policy's Green Paper, Parliament should strongly support driving EU development policy in this direction."
"We will have a better argument for convincing the World Bank to actually follow this drive and be more focused on investments in the coal-fired power station."
"The Bank has now established six criteria as general guidelines for future coal investment."
"The World Bank, under the leadership of Bob Zoellick, is extremely active in the debate, so it would seem that the World Bank is an asset and not something that we should be afraid of."
"It is our ally but we really need to provide European leadership on this issue and in the energy sector for the developing world."
"I would also like to address the issue of the EIB, because it was in the question."
"The Cotonou Agreement is the legislative basis for EIB activity for an amount of EUR 3.1 billion to ACP countries."
"A major instrument in this framework is the ACP Investment Facility."
"The facility finances infrastructure and climate friendly energy projects."
"As far as the energy sector is concerned, no projects exist in the area of fossil fuels."
"The general policy is very clear - to fund climate friendly energy projects based on wind, hydraulic or solar energy."
"In the context of the mid-term review of the EIB External Mandate - covering pre-accession, neighbourhood and partner countries, Asia, Latin America and South Africa - a proposal has been put forward by the Commission to activate an additional EUR 2 billion mandate for 2011-2013 to support EIB financing operations in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation across all regions."
"The proposal stresses that the EIB's own rules and procedures shall include the necessary provisions to ensure that only projects that are economically, financially, environmentally and socially sustainable are supported under the mandate."
"I believe that the EU has already taken some steps in the right direction, but we could really take more steps to provide real leadership for the world, not least by addressing the World Bank's energy strategy."
"Mr President, it is a very pressing and important matter that is being addressed in this Chamber, namely, that of the phasing out of loans for fossil fuel projects."
"I believe that we should have the courage to say exactly what Commissioner Piebalgs said, namely, that the World Bank has a very deliberate energy strategy."
"We can even talk about incentives in this regard, and that is obviously a positive thing."
"Of course, it is not just a question of phasing out, but also, as has been said, of phasing in."
"Being rather persistent, I want to repeat that there are opportunities here for the EU to make specific investments to help people in developing countries, in Africa, Asia and Latin America."
"I believe the Commissioner has heard me speak on a previous occasion about the wood stoves currently found in huts and ordinary houses that are poisoning people."
"Two million people are dying prematurely on account of the gases that are found in ordinary homes."
"In this regard, like the United States and a number of European countries, we could invest in simple solar-powered stoves that at least eliminate 95% of the gases."
"Then they would no longer need to use manure, which we know that they need for cultivating crops, and they would no longer need to use black coal for heating."
"Nor would they need to chop down forests that absolutely should not be chopped down."
"I would like, once again, to emphasise that there are opportunities to do something tangible."
"Often, when we talk about alternative energy sources, we talk ostentatiously about wind energy and solar energy, and of course we should do that."
"However, there is a lack of tangible results, despite the fact that the opportunities are there."
"Do not allow the EU to get left behind on these matters, but let the EU be involved in developing concrete ways of replacing this fossil fuel that we no longer want in either the industrialised nations or the developing countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first, I should like to thank Mrs Keller for her exceptional work on this report."
"Indeed, everyone who worked on this report saw just how unviable the World Bank strategy is on several counts."
"As Mrs Keller said, it finances unviable, large-scale projects, such as hydroelectric and numerous other projects."
"It is a fact that financing for renewable energy sources has risen by 300%."
"At the same time, however, financing for fossil fuel projects has risen by 430%."
"The World Bank - and, to my mind, this is a scandal - has failed to take account of the environmental impact of the projects which it finances."
"At the same time, it is still discussing, even today, the possibility of starting financing for programmes for palm oil plantations."
"It has no respect for the principle of free, prior and informed consent by locals to projects being financed, nor has it integrated (and it should integrate) a full cycle analysis of the projects it finances."
"I truly hope that this report, in its final version after the vote, will send a strong message about the environmental reforms which the World Bank needs to implement internally."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, under the terms of its mandate, the World Bank is required to contribute to eradicating poverty in developing countries."
"All projects financed by the World Bank must have this aim."
"Even when financing a business project to invest in basic social services - health, education, access to water - this requirement must be met."
"If the World Bank makes combating poverty a priority, we can be satisfied that it is fulfilling the remit that we laid down."
"The oral question that we are debating expresses grave reservations about funding petrol or coal-related projects."
"I would like to make a number of comments."
"Firstly, the terms of reference for a World Bank-financed project must include the evaluation criteria to be applied from the outset."
"It must be clear what is to be evaluated and, consequently, the evaluation criteria need to be integrated throughout the project's lifetime."
"Secondly, political dialogue between the World Bank and its partner must consider political and economic governance, both in the country concerned and in relation to the lender."
"Thirdly, where it is possible to promote renewable energies and the costs are justifiable, we need to favour this form of energy generation."
"Fourthly, and here I need to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for having already addressed one of my concerns in his answer to Mrs Keller, the European Investment Bank already takes all these factors into account."
"I can but hope that the World Bank will follow the example of others who have already adopted these priorities, not least the European Investment Bank."
"Given that the 27 Member States of the European Union are also members of the World Bank, we cannot claim to be without any influence on its policy."
"I think that it would be well worth discussing combining forces within the World Bank with a view to resolving the issues raised by Mrs Keller."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Keller on her excellent work."
"Mr President, before I go on, I would also like to praise the work which has been done by my fellow Member, and say that I fully support the issues that have been mentioned here."
"I am going to do something now that I have not done before, but which I think is worthwhile."
"We have a series of documents which holds a set of assumptions, all of them rarely discussed."
"It is as if they were assumptions unworthy of discussion."
"We have the oral question, and we have a resolution which tells us various things, including that the conventional rural electrification programmes financed by the World Bank have failed globally in their task of reaching the poorest in rural areas."
"We are also finding that there will be a possible, putative, change in the World Bank's energy strategy in mid-2011, but we also know that it is in the energy sectors that we can combat poverty in a very specific way, and help to lift people out of poverty."
"We therefore appeal to the World Bank to adopt a development approach that can maximise benefits to the poor while, at the same time, allowing us to combat climate change."
"We have also already said that the loans intended for fossil fuels continue to play a predominant role in the overall energy portfolio of the World Bank, and that we must abandon this predominance."
"We also have the promise that this predominance will no longer be a predominance by 2015, and that there will be a gradual reduction in the financing of these projects based on fossil fuels."
"We have, finally, a set of statements, specifically regarding the need for the World Bank to give priority to access to local energy on a small scale."
"There are many, many others, taking climate change into account."
"Having said that, I would like to edit what has been said, and to which I subscribe."
"I will edit all of the statements that we have made, and leave just two, final, questions, because it is not worthwhile continuing with mere statements of intent."
"The first question is: why can we not draw from all this such a basic conclusion as this?"
"Why do we continue to allow those who pay the piper to call the tune?"
"Why does the World Bank continue to hold responsibility for the world energy strategy?"
"When are we going to make the decision that the world energy strategy should be the object of worldwide coordination anchored in the United Nations?"
"The second question that I will leave with you - I apologise for going slightly over time - is: when are we going to stop imposing a development model upon others, whether this be first or second generation, that is, whether first or second hand, upon the rest of the world, as if it were a development model that should be applied to everyone?"
"There are limits to arrogance."
"We must be more democratic."
"(DE) Mr President, in the 1970s and the early 1980s, the blindness of the World Bank to environmental issues was a major topic for discussion."
"The same speeches were made then as are being made here today, together with certain promises by the World Bank."
"Moves were made to reform the World Bank, but decades have passed since then."
"For a wide variety of reasons, I recently made a visit to a number of countries which are generally referred to as developing countries."
"The situation was unacceptable."
"What has happened to all the projects?"
"Where are the solar plants in the tropics?"
"Where are the sustainable forests in the Amazon or in Vietnam?"
"Where are the solar panels and wind turbines in Kenya?"
"There is absolutely nothing there."
"The only thing that has happened is that the European system of self-government has been copied exactly."
"The people there are governing themselves and they have played into the hands of a few large interested parties, but they have not made any progress."
"Then we are surprised when citizens of the developing countries say despairingly: 'I do not want to live in the Caribbean any more."
"I want to move to the USA and get into the EU via Martinique'."
"We are surprised when the people in the Maghreb countries all want to move here."
"The hypocrisy of this debate is totally unbelievable."
"We have to understand that millions of people have been radicalised."
"They have simply said 'We have had enough!'."
"Everyone who has seen the European Parliament motion for a resolution will have to admit that it could not have been that."
"We should have spoken out much more loudly."
"We should have called on the World Bank much more clearly to take the necessary action."
"Why do we have all these committees - the Committee on Development, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and so on - if all they can produce is a scrappy little piece of paper that, in part, contains the conclusions of the debate which took place in the late 1970s?"
"The whole thing is embarrassing."
"(PL) Mr President, we need convince no one of the importance of energy for developing countries."
"I have seen the surprise on people's faces many times when they learn how much electricity costs in Africa."
"It is probably also true that we need convince no one that the World Bank plays a far from insignificant role when it comes to energy matters in developing countries."
"My political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), tabled a number of amendments to be voted on separately to the resolution we are discussing."
"It seems to us that some parts of the resolution are too critical of the World Bank."
"I do not believe, for example, that we can draw the World Bank's attention to the fact that it regards some types of energy as clean when they should be regarded as environmentally wrong or undesirable."
"Nuclear energy, for example, is widely used in the EU's Member States, and an increasing number of European countries which are dependent on coal or gas are suffering to a certain extent since they are having to limit their emissions, which gives rise to costs which are distributed very unequally between the individual Member States."
"We must therefore exercise caution when telling external bodies which types of energy should be developed."
"I do agree, however, with the idea that it is worth giving particular support to local projects covering small areas, that it is worth supporting low emission projects and that it is worth supporting ideas relating to diversified sources of energy and avoiding energy dependency."
"We would like the World Bank to invest in renewable energy and increased energy efficiency, but we must always bear in mind the fundamental goal, or, in other words, how access to energy is supposed to help people break out of poverty."
"We want to kill several birds with one stone - to create the conditions for development, limit emissions and take into account social and environmental aspects in new energy projects."
"These are ambitious tasks, and I hope the World Bank is not afraid of them."
"At the same time, I know that Commissioner Piebalgs places a great deal of emphasis on the development of energy projects in developing countries, and I can confirm that this is discussed in the Green Paper and that the European Parliament should support this strategy."
"(RO) Mr President, there are currently 1.4 billion people in the world without access to electricity, 85% of whom live in rural areas."
"The Millennium Development Goals to eradicate poverty by 2015 will not be achieved due to the lack of significant progress on providing access to energy."
"Achieving this goal by 2015 means that 395 million people will have access to electricity and 1 billion people will gain access to hygienic facilities for preparing food."
"All these measures will require an annual investment of roughly USD 40 billion in the 2010-2015 period, which amounts to 0.6% of global GDP."
"Universal access to electricity is one of the most important goals set by the governments in developing countries."
"Among the barriers identified as preventing electrification are the high cost of supplying electricity in rural areas and to houses in peri-urban areas, the lack of tax or financial incentives, insufficient capacity for developing and implementing electrification projects, along with the limited ability to generate electricity."
"Rural areas are a special case when it comes to energy requirements."
"In rural areas, not only does the required energy need to be provided, but the actual process of generating it as well, which also creates jobs and supports economic and social development."
"On 11 February 2011, a World Bank report showed that local energy production from renewable sources at a low production cost is a more viable economic solution in the long term."
"This may play a key role in increasing India's energy security so that energy imports and the influence of oil price fluctuations can be reduced."
"The World Bank could therefore act as a partner to the developing countries."
"I believe that the World Bank should support the projects concerned with boosting energy efficiency and local energy production from renewable sources, as well as extensive projects involving electrification and establishing interconnections between different countries."
"(LT) Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for raising in a timely manner what truly is a very relevant issue."
"Energy poverty remains a huge problem, and related issues are preventing those living in the world's poorest regions from improving their quality of life, from having the opportunity to earn a living and generally contribute towards increasing growth and productivity."
"This is one of the fundamental factors impeding general social and economic development and preventing these regions from being lifted out of poverty."
"As the rapporteur mentioned, the statistics are disturbing - around 1.5 billion people do not have any access to electricity, and more than 2.5 billion people are still using traditional fuel obtained from biomass."
"According to World Health Organisation data, across the world, two million people die prematurely from respiratory diseases each year due to the use of this fuel."
"So far, the World Bank's previous energy strategy has not produced tangible results."
"Furthermore, support for the use of fossil fuel still remains greater than for renewable or clean sources of energy."
"Hitherto, significant investment has been provided for coal-fired power plants, and this continues to make these poor countries dependent on fossil fuel, which heavily pollutes the environment."
"The agreement adopted by the G20 leaders to reduce support and funding for fossil fuel projects, which should not receive any funding at all from 2015, is a positive and welcome stimulus."
"The new strategy must also thoroughly assess the issue of funding supervision and control, so that this assistance is used for those energy projects that may bring long-term benefits and genuinely contribute to the development of these regions and improving the quality of people's lives."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piebalgs in particular."
"As a former Commissioner for energy, he naturally knows all about our strategy."
"I believe that there is a lot to be done in the field of development cooperation, particularly with regard to technical aid."
"Europe must not only make payments to the World Bank; it must also take action."
"Europe and the European institutions must play a stronger role in the World Bank and it will be a major challenge to ensure that family businesses can be supported with development aid, that small and medium-sized energy generation enterprises can be promoted, because a lot of small businesses together can achieve economies of scale and produce a corresponding return on investment."
"One of the most important issues is, of course, the storage of energy."
"This will play a central role in development cooperation."
"Mr President, I suppose one could say that those of us who are still here at this hour of the night are probably powered by some form of renewable energy, perhaps solar power or maybe even divine power in the form of a halo above our heads."
"Either way, the discussion has been very varied, and not surprisingly, because this is always a contentious issue."
"But I think the Commissioner got the balance right, probably better than most of us, in terms of where we are going and what needs to be done in the future."
"I think a few points need to be made more precise."
"Whether countries are in the developing world or the developed world, if they have resources of fossil fuel - coal - or nuclear energy, they are going to utilise them."
"The question is: do we finance them or do we not?"
"Obviously in Europe, in terms of Cancún, Kyoto, etc. we want to push the renewable agenda, and that is absolutely correct."
"But I think in doing that, Mr Martin is probably right in one sense that we need to speak with a louder voice and push the World Bank into promoting and financing more renewable energy projects than they are perhaps doing right now."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is very important to our debate, even if it is late at night, because I think the World Bank's energy strategy is an opportunity."
"It is a genuine opportunity to respond to energy challenges."
"If we also look at what the International Energy Agency is saying about energy poverty, about renewable energy, it is certainly a huge challenge, but the World Bank, together with our leadership, could make the necessary change."
"If we go back a couple of years in our Union's history, our renewable energy target seemed impossible to meet, even if it was a rather humble target of 18%, if I recall correctly."
"Now it seems that we are well on track."
"Sometimes, however, you need to take your courage in both hands and anticipate the real challenges."
"The World Bank makes the whole process very open."
"There will be the World Bank energy week in Washington."
"We could also submit our contributions to the World Bank, which is very open to new ideas."
"If we are courageous, that will give even more courage to the World Bank."
"So it is important that we go with open hearts and put these very ambitious ideas to the World Bank."
"Otherwise, many people could attempt to evade this challenge."
"It is definitely a question of where to start."
"I would say it is still access to energy that we should be looking at, because access to energy also means sustainable and efficient energy."
"The recent trends in the countries we are working with show huge urbanisation, so in a way, it has changed the pattern of the whole energy riddle."
"It means not only decentralised generation, but also agglomeration areas, so energy efficiency, strange as it sounds, should also be part of the strategy."
"Most importantly, we should beef up."
"We have energy facilities: EUR 200 million."
"You cannot do too much on energy with EUR 200 million."
"We need to envisage long-term funding, because I believe Europe's trademark should be renewable energy."
"With this, and the capacities of the World Bank, we really could do something that matters, not only for energy supply, but also in terms of taking substantial steps to combat climate change."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 February 2011."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Implementing measures (Rule 88): see Minutes"
"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure"
"The interpretation of Rules 56 and 50 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, which was adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs at its sitting of Monday 14 February 2011, was announced during yesterday's voting time."
"As this interpretation was not contested by anyone pursuant to Rule 211(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the interpretation can be deemed to have been adopted."
"As a result, the vote on the Mathieu report on the procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State has been removed from the agenda for this part-session."
"As you are aware, the matter has been the subject of much debate, and now we have an interpretation on the basis of the Rules of Procedure and the principles governing our work."
"2010 progress report on Croatia (debate)"
"- The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 2010 progress report on Croatia."
"Yesterday I met with the Croatian Prime Minister, and I was accompanied by two representatives of key institutions of ours; Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, and Mr Hökmark, the head of our permanent delegation to Croatia."
"We discussed the subject of Croatia's progress on its path towards the European Union."
"I am extremely pleased that today we can discuss the status of the negotiations and the outlook for Croatia's future in the European Union directly, with all our fellow Members present."
"I am also pleased that Commissioner Füle, who is responsible for our neighbourhood policy, is present in the Chamber."
"I would now like Mr Martonyi to take the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Mr Martonyi and the Hungarian Presidency attach a great deal of importance to enlarging the EU to include Croatia, and this is therefore an important item on the Hungarian Presidency's agenda."
"Please take the floor, Mr Martonyi."
"The neighbourhood policy is very important for the European Union, the Mediterranean region, the Eastern Partnership and, first and foremost, the Western Balkans."
"I will now give the floor to the Commissioner responsible for that policy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on Croatia, Mr Hannes Swoboda, and express my appreciation for his fair and balanced report."
"It acknowledges the impressive progress achieved by Croatia in meeting the criteria for accession, while recognising the efforts that are still necessary to conclude the negotiations."
"The European Union and Croatia have provisionally closed 28 of the 35 negotiating chapters."
"The ministerial accession conference of 19 April should be able to provisionally close additional chapters where Croatia has either fulfilled, or is very close to fulfilling, the closing benchmarks."
"As noted by the December 2010 General Affairs Council, the conclusion of negotiations is within reach."
"As with all negotiations, the most difficult issues remain to be tackled in the final phase."
"As Minister Martonyi has just underlined, the Hungarian Presidency announced earlier its goal to finish negotiations in the first half of 2011, if all criteria and benchmarks are fulfilled."
"This is an ambitious goal which can only be achieved if Croatia continues to make an exceptional effort to fulfil the remaining requirements in time."
"The main outstanding challenges are the closing benchmarks for Chapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights and Chapter 8: Competition policy."
"Croatia has been working hard in both areas, but now is the time to go the final mile."
"As regards the judiciary and fundamental rights, the main areas where Croatia is called upon to deliver on its commitments are: establishing a credible and sustainable track-record in the fight against corruption; strengthening the independence, accountability, impartiality and professionalism of the judiciary; addressing the issue of impunity for war crimes; meeting targets in the Housing Care Programme for refugees and improving the implementation of minority rights."
"Full cooperation with ICTY remains a requirement."
"In each of these areas, there are clear benchmarks to be met."
"The Commission is currently taking stock of the progress achieved by Croatia for each of the benchmarks, on which we will report in our upcoming interim report on this chapter due by the middle of March."
"I had a very useful and constructive meeting with Prime Minister Kosor yesterday."
"We discussed the importance of maintaining the momentum of the accession negotiations and of tackling the remaining outstanding issues."
"The Croatian authorities are well aware of what they still need to do."
"Indeed, I was very pleased to be reassured of the Prime Minister's personal commitment to ensuring that the work continues at full speed until the European Union accession process can be concluded."
"I could not agree more with those who call on the European Union neither to make 'special discounts' nor to impose artificial hurdles on Croatia."
"The principles of full respect for the conditionality that applies to the candidate countries, and full respect for the commitments that the European Union has made, remain the cornerstones of the enlargement process."
"This is the essence of its credibility."
"The Commission will continue to give its full support to Croatia, which is working hard to achieve its goal of accession to the European Union."
"I am sure, and here I am following the line of Minister Martonyi, that the Member States will decide that accession negotiations can be concluded as soon as we can ascertain that the remaining closing benchmarks have been met."
"I am equally sure that, when Parliament is requested to give its consent on the draft Accession Treaty, it will play this critical role in accordance with the very constructive approach that it has shown with regard to Croatia's accession process."
"Along with your rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, I firmly believe that the citizens of Croatia, after being called upon to endorse their country's accession to the European Union, will be able to vote for their representatives in the next elections to the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to all of the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation, the result of which is that we have a report that will hopefully receive broad support."
"I will start by mentioning what, I am sure, was a very successful visit to this House yesterday by the Prime Minister, Jadranka Kosor."
"Mr President, you mentioned that Croatia's accession is not only important for Croatia and for the European Union, but it is also important as a signal to the whole region."
"The first point that I would like to use to emphasise this relates to the reforms."
"If a country carries out the tasks that have been asked of it, then we must also keep the promises that were made with regard to membership."
"As Mr Martonyi and the Commissioner have said, there is still work to be done."
"The message must still be: please also take the final steps of the reforms so that we can achieve our common goal of concluding the treaty in June."
"During the conversation with Mrs Kosor, Mr Schulz said that the dispute in the Gulf of Piran would previously have been settled by fighting a war."
"Today, we sit around a table and try to find a method of negotiating these matters."
"That, too, is an important signal to the region as a whole - I am thinking of Serbia and Kosovo here - that such disputes can be settled, not by fighting, but simply by negotiations and dialogue."
"The Prime Minister said that in her country the government and opposition were moving in the same direction with regard to the EU."
"My last conversation with Zoran Milanović, the leader of the Social Democrat opposition, also confirmed that to be the case."
"Yesterday, we discussed Albania."
"Albania, too, could take this as an example of how to go about things when it comes to important common concerns, over and above any political debate."
"We should therefore send a dual message to Zagreb and Croatia as a whole to the effect that we - the Council, Commission and European Parliament - are working together to be able to conclude the negotiations in June so that the treaty can be concluded and we can then give our consent in the autumn, so allowing the ratification process to actually be carried out, but please - and this is addressed to Croatia - deal with the issues that are still outstanding."
"With regard to combating corruption, courageous steps have already been taken, but there are a few final steps that are still needed."
"With regard to the reform of the justice system and also where the shipyards are concerned there is still work to be done."
"However, all of these points are also referred to in our report, and they do not represent insurmountable barriers, but provide the opportunity for Croatia to still fulfil the relevant requirements."
"With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, we should send a joint message today from all of us here to Croatia, and indeed to the whole region, to the effect that if a country carries out the tasks it has been asked to do, the European Union will also keep its promise of allowing it to become a member of this Union."
"Mr President, as you too said yesterday: it will also benefit the European Union if we accept Croatia, provided it has done what it has been asked to do."
"I would therefore like to thank the shadow rapporteurs once again."
"If we are able to send out a signal that is as united as possible to Croatia and the whole region, we will have taken a major step forward for the peaceful integration of the entire region."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to admit that I feel very moved today, because this year marks 20 years since the movement for democracy in Slovenia and Croatia was consolidated."
"It was a year old and the people rejoiced as they did in Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere."
"Then on 28 June 1991 came the brutal attack by the Yugoslav People's Army."
"At that time, everything seemed to have reverted back to how it used to be."
"I was in Vukovar when this small, blossoming model of Europe was destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes and thousands lost their lives."
"Since then, I have been able to accompany Croatia along the path towards the European Union."
"We quite clearly have to acknowledge that Croatia has made an extraordinary effort to move along this path."
"The Commissioner has come up with the key word today."
"He spoke of fairness."
"We could give the Swoboda report the overall title of 'Fairness for Croatia', because that is the heart of the matter."
"It is not about privileges or discounts - that has rightly been said - but about fairness."
"Croatia is ready for accession to the European Union now."
"Final efforts still need to be made in a few areas in the next few months."
"However, we must not create artificial barriers for this country, as has, unfortunately, repeatedly been the case over the last few years."
"Croatia belongs in a historical and cultural context with Slovenia and Hungary."
"It should have been accepted into the European Union along with these Central European countries - Croatia is also very much a Central European country."
"This did not happen for a multitude of reasons, but now the time is ripe."
"That is why we are pressing for this."
"We are not setting any dates - we are sticking to our line that criteria are more important than dates."
"However, we are calling very strongly for no artificial barriers to be created and for this country to be treated fairly and justly."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) Mr President, today is the last time we are debating the report on the progress of Croatia as a candidate for full membership of the European Union."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hannes Swoboda, who has been doing this work for a number of years, for his constructive and friendly approach, both amongst the shadow rapporteurs and in his dealings with the Croatian Government, and I would say, the Croatian people."
"In retrospect and given the circumstances in which Croatia became an independent country twenty years ago, we could perhaps say that it has been waiting long enough, if not too long, for membership."
"Minister Martonyi, you have given us very specific information about your plans concerning Croatia's accession negotiations."
"We support your plans and hope that they will become a reality in their entirety."
"For the leadership in Zagreb, there remains much to be done in the months before Croatia wraps up negotiations."
"Chapter 23 has throughout been the subject of the special attention of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE)."
"We discussed and agreed on this yesterday during the friendly conversation between Mr Verhofstadt, President of the ALDE Group, and Mrs Kosor."
"This chapter holds the key to the rule of law, to dealing seriously with the legacy of the past, to an effective and impartial judiciary, to legal certainty and equality for all citizens."
"Any democratic country based on the rule of law - any member of the European Union - must ensure freedoms such as openness and media independence, protection of minorities, gender equality and protection of everyone who is different."
"The Croatian Government and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor deserve credit for tackling corruption and crime in a determined way."
"Croatia should also be credited with successfully establishing friendly relations with its neighbours, but it should be encouraged at the same time to resolve the issues outstanding."
"When we give Croatia the green light for the last round of negotiations and for its last push on the way to full membership, we should point out that this report is addressed to all the countries of south-eastern Europe which have the same expectations."
"We, too, have expectations: we expect Europe to complete the enlargement process and become a continent of cohesion and equal values."
"Please allow me to add just one more sentence."
"Only in this way will the European Union, in today's world, be able to become, and play the part of, a world leader."
"Thank you for your patience, Mr President."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to join those who have thanked Mr Swoboda for the good cooperation last year and, for the first time, this year."
"I agree with Mr Posselt that it is a fair report."
"We very much look forward to welcoming Croatia - as has been said - as soon as it has met all the criteria."
"It is a special country to be joining, and the EU will have a special responsibility to make sure afterwards that all the other countries in the Western Balkans will be able to join too. It is from that regional perspective that Croatia needs to be the best in the class now, so that its fellow classmates can join afterwards."
"We have a responsibility to the other countries, because if we fail now and make mistakes now it will be much harder for others to join. We cannot give up on this objective for the Western Balkans."
"Some of you have mentioned Chapter 23 on corruption."
"We believe that the EU also has to be honest about itself, and really to consider to what extent it was also implicated in corruption."
"Therefore, we also call on OLAF to look at what the implications are for the EU."
"I urge all Groups to join that effort, as we need to be honest with ourselves too."
"My last point is that how we deal with the past is an important part of joining the EU."
"The ICTY has been mentioned."
"This is crucial, but we also feel that the local war crimes tribunals need to work better."
"A report by Amnesty International highlights that there are still a number of pitfalls and deficiencies."
"We feel there is room for improvement, for example on witness protection, and we would like to see improvement there as well."
"We feel it is crucial for the EU to insist on that aspect of the past and working with the past."
"Apart from this, we are all looking forward to welcoming Croatia to this House."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, we believe that enlargement is one of the more successful aspects of EU policy, provided it is carried out according to rigorous criteria and that lessons are learned from previous accessions."
"According to the Council, the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia is within reach, but we know from the Commission that corruption issues and judicial reform have not yet been properly dealt with."
"This is very serious."
"Our concerns are not artificial."
"Croatia, with a population of 4.5 million, apparently suffers from nearly a million backlogged court cases, with a significant number of cases connected to the abuse of property rights."
"Media freedom is also under assault."
"Former ministers have been charged with corruption."
"Some might see this as evidence of action."
"Actually it reveals the depth of a malaise that has hardly been addressed."
"Widespread corruption among politicians and the judiciary has meant a failure to tackle organised crime directly connected to the Balkan route."
"Despite the litany of problems outlined here, Croatia's early accession seems a foregone conclusion."
"It would be a pity if the accession process became a mere formality, dependent on subjective political whim, completed before these fundamental problems are resolved."
"Mr President, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are in favour of the accession of Croatia to the European Union and trust that it will soon become a full member, provided that this is the will of the Croatian people and provided that the country satisfies all the accession criteria."
"The progress report notes, and we welcome, the progress which has been made in returning refugees, in women's rights and gender equality and in bridging differences with neighbouring countries."
"However, we insist on further reforms, especially in the judiciary and in stamping out corruption."
"However, we must also pay attention to the socio-economic problems of the people of Croatia, such as poverty, long-term unemployment and the undermining of labour rights."
"Unfortunately, the proposals to promote a liberal economy will exacerbate the socio-economic situation of the Croatians."
"We therefore support the promotion of real social development which will guarantee quality of life for all citizens of Croatia by modernising the social protection system, addressing unemployment, improving access to health services, housing and education and wiping out discrimination, especially towards minorities."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (SK) Mr President, since October 2005, when the decision was taken to commence talks over Croatia's accession to the EU, the Croatian Government has made extensive changes to the running of the country, with the aim of best preparing Croatia for EU accession."
"The greatest progress in the accession process was made in 2010, when our Croatian friends concluded negotiations on a number of complex chapters and made fundamental changes to the constitution, as well as making progress over a civilised solution to border disputes with neighbouring countries."
"The official visit of Serbian president Tadic to Vukovar showed that relations between Croat and Serb citizens can also be built on mutual respect, esteem and understanding."
"The speed at which the accession process is finalised now rests solely with the Croatian side, who, after fulfilling all of the conditions for EU accession, must also seek the consent of their citizens for such a step in a nationwide referendum."
"I sincerely wish our Croatian friends well in rapidly concluding the final chapters and in being capable of confirming, through a popular vote, their readiness to become part of the European Community."
"Mr President, less than 20 years ago Croatia fought to secure its independence."
"Now it is being handed out without a shot being fired."
"Croatia has had to make extensive and intrusive legislative changes."
"It has also had to withdraw support from its vital industries and the people who work in them."
"The Croatians must do all of these things before the European Union condescends to accept Croatia for membership."
"Of greatest importance, all of these changes are being conceded before the consent of the people through a promised referendum has been granted, or even asked for."
"Despite opinion-poll evidence of majority opposition to EU membership, a positive outcome of the referendum is taken for granted."
"When enormous changes are carried out in anticipation of a consent that is yet to be obtained, we can be assured that consent is seen as a mere formality."
"The report here says that editors and journalists complain about undue political pressure."
"However, it is silent about how this pressure will allow the referendum to be conducted freely and fairly."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are in fact now in the last round before accession, insofar as we are to discuss this matter here in the Community institutions, because then there still remains the ratification process in the national parliaments, which will certainly not be easy, either."
"However, as I was able, during my time as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to closely observe the previous twelve Member States to join as part of the enlargement process, I can say that Croatia is a country that has done a considerable amount of work over a long period of time in order to fulfil the criteria and, for that reason, the progression to a 'yes' is a positive one."
"We should support this for political reasons."
"It is also a signal to other countries that may perhaps have to wait a long time until the door to Europe is open rather than, by and large, being closed."
"The general political message is important."
"However, based on our experiences with other countries, I would say that Croatia needs to work on reforming its judicial and administrative systems in its own interests, too - irrespective of the accession process."
"When proceedings remain unresolved for too long or accusations of corruption are made but the proceedings taken against the accused take too long, it damages the overall development of the country."
"More work ought to be done in this regard."
"(SV) Mr President, first of all I would like say a big thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, who has done an excellent job."
"Croatia's membership of the EU is getting close now, but a few challenges still remain, for example the fight against corruption."
"Croatia has adopted new and better legislation, but now the reforms need to be implemented."
"Effective investigations, prosecutions and court rulings are needed."
"Right now all eyes are on the case of the former conservative Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, who is in prison in Austria."
"We applaud what journalists and politicians in Croatia have shown by uncovering the corruption in the political elite."
"However, the case of Ivo Sanader also represents a moment of truth for the EU, as corruption requires the involvement of two parties."
"Given the accusations that Ivo Sanader attempted to influence the EU in an improper manner, I have proposed that the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, should work together with Croatian investigators to clarify this information because, of course, we do not know if it is true."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) wants to delete this important part of the resolution, but, along with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we are calling on all of the political groups to support it."
"The EU must be proactive and not simply place the responsibility on Croatia."
"Mr President, in the stormy waters of the global economic crisis, it is encouraging to see that Croatia is holding a steady course towards membership."
"The progress so far has been impressive, but I want to emphasise that this positive momentum should now feed into other areas where much remains to be done."
"There are two points I would like to stress here today."
"The first is the reform and strengthening of the judiciary."
"A robust and independent judicial syste m is absolutely essential in order to fight corruption and to ensure the rule of law in the long term."
"It is not merely a matter of arresting criminals; it is about dealing with them afterwards."
"Otherwise, efforts to tackle corruption and organised crime will have no effect."
"The second point I want to mention is the need for society in Croatia to build on tolerance."
"The European project is about reconciliation, and this applies not only between countries - and I applaud the improved relations with Croatia's neighbours - but within them as well."
"Threats of violence against minorities are completely unacceptable."
"I fully understand how difficult this is, but I am of the firm belief that this would not only boost the accession talks, but also that the effort itself would be of direct benefit to Croatian society."
"(PL) Mr President, we should without a doubt support the Hungarian Presidency in its ambitious plans to conclude negotiations with Croatia during the first half of this year."
"Croatia's membership in the European Union will mean we gain an important and constructive ally, since the country is already playing an important role and acting as a major stabilising force in the region, and setting an example for many other Balkan countries also thinking about acceding to the European Union in the future."
"Today I would like to express my great respect and admiration for the reforms undertaken by the Croatian Government and Croatian society, particularly those relating to the fight against corruption and organised crime and reforms of the public administration and the judiciary."
"It goes without saying that there are still areas requiring improvement and completion."
"I hope that this is achieved as soon as possible."
"It is also true that we are hearing reports from Croatia that the Croatian people are not entirely convinced that membership will benefit their country."
"I believe that it would be wise for us to take steps which help to reverse this trend without delay, in cooperation with the Croatian Government."
"(NL) Mr President, Croatia has made good progress on its way to achieving EU membership."
"That is beyond dispute and I am pleased about that."
"There are two issues, however, which I am still seriously concerned about."
"Corruption in this Balkan country is still widespread, see for example recitals 7 and 8 of the resolution we are debating."
"That is having a major impact on the economy and on trade relations with this country."
"We urgently need a better approach to tackling this problem, possibly in cooperation with European institutions."
"My second concern is the poor administrative organisation in the country, see recital 28 of the resolution."
"Sound administrative organisation is necessary if EU legislation is to be properly implemented and if Croatia is not to be caught napping by events."
"As long as these two bottlenecks remain unaddressed, I will continue to feel concerned about the swift pace with which the Hungarian Presidency wants to bring about Croatia's accession."
"In my opinion, past experience should lead us to make the quality of accession our objective, not accession itself."
"That will help us to secure people's support, and the support of my Dutch citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, overall, developments in Croatia are going in the right direction."
"The theory is complete, but it still needs to be proven in practice."
"However, there are three areas where significant work still remains to be done."
"Firstly, Croatia must work closer with the International Court of Justice in The Hague to speed up progress with regard to human rights and the prosecution of former war criminals."
"As stated by Amnesty International in 'Behind a Wall of Silence', there are blatant individual cases of human rights violations that are still be dealt with."
"The protection of human rights is a key issue for the EU."
"We must not be prepared to compromise where this is concerned, and indeed we are not prepared to compromise where this is concerned."
"Secondly, there is the corruption."
"It still permeates society, industry and politics."
"I welcome the efforts of the Croatian Government to tackle corruption in its own country, but at the same time we must insist that this problem is also rigorously pursued."
"Thirdly, Croatia must ensure, in its own interests, that swift progress is now made with regard to the reforms initiated in the judicial system."
"(PL) Madam President, two years ago, when I was the chair of the Polish Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, I had the pleasure of playing host to members of Croatia's Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"On this occasion, the members of the Croatian committee asked me if I knew how many Poles were currently on sailing holidays in Croatia."
"It turned out that the answer was several tens of thousands in total."
"The millions of tourists who visit this beautiful country today can tell us that Croatia is a modern and democratic country, and confirm that it is ready for membership of the European Union."
"Yet those same members of the Croatian committee also asked me how Poland was restructuring its shipyards."
"In other words, several problems still remain, as everyone here has mentioned, and they are problems which need to be resolved."
"In spite of everything, I hope that Mr Martonyi's hopes will be fulfilled, that our Hungarian friends and the European Commission will conclude the negotiations and that today we will hear from Mr Sikorski, the head of Polish diplomacy, who will be with us in Parliament, that Poland will have the pleasure of witnessing Croatia's accession to the European Union while holding the Presidency of the European Council."
"(SL) Madam President, allow me to join in the chorus of praise for rapporteur Swoboda's approach and work."
"I sincerely hope that, for Croatia and for Mr Swoboda, this really will be the last report and that Croatia will join us as soon as possible."
"In any case, membership will allow Croatia to make up for some of the time it has lost in joining the EU."
"Indeed, if we go by the stage of development of Croatia's economy, society, culture and arts, this country could easily have joined the group of countries which joined the European Union seven years ago."
"I suggest that the authorities in Zagreb take advantage of Croatia's accession to the European Union in order to tackle decisively the culture of corruption and crime."
"Developing the freedoms of objective media and protecting objective journalists working for the Croatian public television broadcaster is another matter of paramount importance."
"Croatia's accession to the EU will mean that we are embracing and holding out a hand to the Balkan region."
"I look forward to us working together with our Croatian colleagues to bring stabilisation and progress to this, still turbulent, region."
"(BG) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his good work and I really hope that this report will be the last one before Croatia signs the Treaty of Accession to the European Union."
"I believe that Croatia's entry into the EU will give an impetus to reforms in the region and will be a success for the whole of Europe."
"Croatia recently signalled this itself by providing free legal translations of the acquis communautaire to its neighbours from the former Yugoslavia - Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia."
"The country has thus shown that it is willing and able to contribute to the region's European future."
"Accepting Croatia into the EU will give a clear signal that the EU honours its undertakings towards the Western Balkans and that expansion is an open-ended process."
"I would like to highlight that although every country on our continent has its own problems, we should be careful when pointing the finger at eastern European countries, when talking about corruption and crime."
"These are not a trademark just of this region, but a challenge for all of us, and only through combined efforts can we limit the negative tendencies in this area."
"Transparency and democracy are immutable values and it is for this very reason that we have to support and encourage reforms in the Western Balkans."
"I wish Croatia all the best and look forward to greeting it here as the 28th Member State of the European Union."
"(HU) Madam President, we must note with strong criticism towards the EU that even though Croatia was, in several respects, already prepared for accession at the time of the last enlargement wave six years ago, it is still being prevented from joining. For this reason we can only agree with the objective of the Hungarian Presidency of making the integration of Croatia one of its highest priorities during its term."
"Similarly, we can only agree with the statement of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that the unification of Europe cannot be complete without the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans."
"The states of the former Yugoslavia that remain outside are like gaping black holes in the map of the EU."
"The accession of Croatia marks the beginning of the change of that situation."
"As Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said yesterday, it is our moral obligation to provide this encouragement for the countries of South Eastern Europe, because for them there is no alternative to integration."
"(PL) Madam President, both the Swoboda report and the statements by the Presidency and Commissioner Füle indicate that the climate for concluding negotiations with Croatia is very positive."
"Particular emphasis should be given to the determination shown by Croatia itself, for example by the Prime Minister, Mrs Kosor, not only with regard to concluding the negotiations themselves, but also with regard to cooperation with the country's neighbours and the International Criminal Tribunal."
"The prospect of concluding negotiations in the near future and the mood prevailing in the Chamber will also help Croatia."
"It is an important sign that any future problems will not be allowed to accumulate, and that the 20-year wait will end with the signature of the Treaty of Accession."
"Let us also acknowledge the symbolic gestures made by Croatia, for example by passing on a translation of the full acquis communautaire to all its neighbours working towards membership."
"I would like to acknowledge the work done by Mr Swoboda, and I too am sure that this is the last report on Croatia's progress in preparations for membership."
"We will soon welcome the country as a Member State of the European Union."
"(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, I clearly support the Hungarian Presidency in its endeavour to conclude the accession negotiations of Croatia in June."
"In several respects, Croatia has achieved a higher degree of development than some EU Member States."
"It is obvious that, as Mr Martonyi mentioned, there is still a lot to be done."
"Mr Hannes Swoboda has an excellent understanding of the complexities of the Western Balkan region."
"The success of Croatia could serve as an incentive for Serbia and the other countries of the Western Balkans."
"It is important for our friends in the Western Balkans and our Croatian colleagues to understand that their internal reforms must be implemented not for the sake of the EU, but for the sake of their own people."
"I believe it is of exceptional importance to improve the situation of Serb, Hungarian and other national minorities, and to ensure the well-deserved return of the Serbs who fled or had been driven away, the Serbs of Krajina, and to settle the neighbourhood relations between Slovenia and Croatia."
"We must appreciate that the Croatian head of state has made several gestures toward the historic reconciliation of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia."
"(SL) Madam President, to the Croatian Government and the European Commission I wish plenty of determination, patience, perseverance and energy in finalising reforms and I also wish that perhaps Croatia should mark the twentieth anniversary of its independence by concluding its negotiations."
"That is my sincere wish."
"What will prove possible, however, depends on the Croatian Government and the cooperation between it, that is the ruling coalition, and the opposition in the Croatian Parliament."
"What we also need now is much greater social sensitivity and responsiveness amongst politicians."
"The current economic crisis is pushing any benefits which accession to the EU might bring Croatia's economy and its citizens to the margins of social priorities and is increasing criticism of the European Union."
"Last but not least, Croatia also needs its people to vote yes in a referendum."
"Any slowing down of the momentum of Croatia's accession would not have any disastrous consequences for Croatia, but it would send out an extremely negative message to the countries of the Western Balkans which are on the way to the EU."
"Without negotiations being concluded, Croatian MPs will not be able to gain observer status in this House and there will be no membership."
"I therefore call on you to keep up the pace and to make every effort."
"(NL) Madam President, I am happy that Croatia is coming ever closer to accession."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is strongly in favour of the accession of all the Balkan countries, as well as Turkey."
"However, we are such great advocates of their accession precisely because we attach such great importance to the reforms that are required in order to attain membership."
"Croatia has not completed these reforms yet."
"The process must continue."
"When voting, we will therefore seek to ensure that no specific date is given in the report."
"It is possible that the negotiations might be completed in the first half of this year but, equally, that might not happen."
"This is not about when negotiations are completed."
"This is about Croatia complying with all the criteria by then."
"Indeed, if there is one lesson we have learned from the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, it is this: that we should not be giving a specific date."
"Instead, we need to make clear what still needs to be done."
"One more point: one of the issues on which Croatia could be doing a little more is the protection of sexual minorities."
"It would be nice if our current EU Presidency set a good example by allowing the gay pride in Budapest on 18 June 2011 to go ahead."
"Madam President, Croatia's progress towards EU membership continues smoothly, as the report makes clear."
"British Conservatives support the enlargement of the EU to include countries that fully meet the Copenhagen criteria, as we believe that a larger EU should result in a more flexible and less centralised union."
"Croatia should be congratulated for its efforts to stamp out corruption, as evidenced by the arrest of former Prime Minister Sanader."
"I am pleased that Slovenia will no longer be blocking Croatia's accession over the two countries' border dispute."
"This was always a bilateral issue but should in no way preclude Croatia from joining our Union."
"There is also a small dispute with Montenegro, for which I am the rapporteur, which will be resolved by the ICJ."
"I also believe that Croatia's accession will accelerate the integration of the whole region of the former Yugoslavia into the EU, in particular as Montenegro's rapporteur and a strong friend of Serbia."
"I hope that Croatian membership will inspire both countries to press ahead with reforms and that Croatia will not try and settle old scores, once it is in the Union, by blocking Serbian accession."
"(DE) Madam President, among the candidate countries, Croatia is known to be the country that has made the greatest amount of progress."
"That is not surprising, as culturally and historically it is firmly rooted in Central Europe."
"Croatia has proven its readiness to join the EU many times, for example with the settlement of the fishing dispute."
"Further efforts are, of course, needed in connection with corruption, but clearly there is no lack of will here, as can be seen by the arrest of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader."
"There has also been some movement with regard to dealing with war crimes."
"In this regard, it remains to be seen what role the German arrest warrants issued for high-ranking former members of the Yugoslav secret service will play."
"Croatia seems to be prepared to move away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees."
"In this regard, it would also be desirable if the EU were to support not only the war refugees, but also the displaced people and to seek a solution to the restitution claims of the Danube Swabians."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to the balanced resolution of my colleague, Mr Swoboda, and say that it is vital for us to make a success of this accession."
"This leads me to draw attention to the considerable misgivings of certain sectors of public opinion, as this accession has come at the wrong time."
"History does not work to a timetable and we are in a period of crisis."
"The people of Europe have misgivings."
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was a wave of post-communist accessions and today we proceed on a case-by-case basis."
"That is why, Commissioner, I think that a major communication campaign is needed in all EU Member States, and perhaps even in Croatia itself, to explain all the work that has been achieved, that all the chapters are well respected and that serious preparations have been made for this accession."
"That is my proposal, because the competence for accession does not lie with Europe."
"Competence for accession lies with the States and with the peoples of those States."
"We have a duty to make a success of this accession."
"Let us use all the resources at our disposal during this difficult period of European integration that we are going through."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you very much for this encouraging and constructive debate."
"The draft European Parliament resolution, with its balanced message, is of vital support for the work undertaken by the Commission."
"It provides much useful guidance for further work by Croatia, and I particularly welcome the many references to fairness, quality and credibility made during today's debate."
"I also fully agree with those statements made today underlining that this whole process and the efforts required are for the benefit of Croatian citizens."
"Those benefits will have to be clearly communicated in the months to come."
"The constructive and steadfast support provided by Parliament for Croatia's accession process is an important signal."
"It is important not only for Croatia itself, but for all the candidate countries and potential candidates."
"Indeed, your support will encourage them to keep up the intensity of their efforts on the path towards the European Union and closing negotiations successfully."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, first and foremost, on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to express my acknowledgement and thanks for Parliament's - and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda's - continuous engagement and positive contribution to the efforts we are making to advance not only towards the successful enlargement to include Croatia, but the progress of the enlargement process as a whole."
"I firmly believe that all these efforts have been very well demonstrated by this morning's very constructive and very useful debate."
"I also firmly believe that the resolution to be adopted will underline Parliament's crucial role, which indeed goes beyond the concrete item of Croatia's accession."
"This will send an extremely important message to European public opinion, to the citizens of Europe, to the effect that enlargement does indeed serve their best interests, and it will perhaps convince them that the enlargement fatigue which developed, and was felt, right after what we now call the reunification of Europe, has gone, and that the train of the enlargement process has to go on."
"At the same time, it will also send an extremely important political message to the other candidate and aspirant countries."
"This is also underlined in your report and resolution."
"We all know that the key factor of stability, cooperation and reconciliation in the Western Balkans is indeed the European perspective."
"So the European perspective has to be credible and has to be underlined and demonstrated by concrete measures."
"That is precisely the upcoming accession of Croatia to the European Union."
"We all know that what we have here is unfinished business."
"Europe is still not a whole and our fundamental objective is to take this process on."
"Some extremely important remarks and comments were made with respect, for example, to whether the accession negotiations have been too long or not."
"It is true that they have lasted almost six years and that this is longer than the negotiation process was for our countries."
"What I would recommend now is that we look to the future and try to speed up this process as much as we can."
"Very many important advances and achievements have been made on both sides, and I would only underline again and again our determination that, with combined efforts on all sides, we can now make a credible, good quality enlargement. This would be an extremely important message for all of us, inside and outside the present European Union."
"I would like to thank you again for your extremely important thoughts and comments, and also to express my thanks to the Commission - all that of course in the hope that we will be able to realise our objective, which is, I repeat, to conclude negations before the end of June this year."
"I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure on the subject of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12:00 today, Tuesday, 16 February."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"We hope that Croatia makes fast progress in the negotiations for EU membership."
"Speeding up Croatia's accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe."
"Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure."
"For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms."
"In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin."
"I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition."
"In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea."
"The report is generally favourable for Croatia."
"It shows that the country is close to completing the accession negotiations."
"However, at the same time, as in previous years, it draws attention to persistent, and often serious, shortcomings."
"In light of previous experience with the Croatia-Slovenia territorial dispute, it is concerning that there has not been significant positive progress in respect of Croatia's numerous territorial disputes with its other neighbours (in particular, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also Serbia and Montenegro)."
"The extremely slow approach to the punishment of war crimes against the Serbs continues to raise some important issues."
"'Several hundred cases' remain to be investigated and prosecuted; the fact that the Croatian judiciary is ignoring these cases ensures the continuing distrust of the Serbs."
"Croatia has also still not submitted the documents known as the artillery diaries to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY)."
"The time has therefore come to consider how far the EU should get involved in this matter."
"Even the 2010 return of Serbian refugees was very limited."
"The report does not say how many of the 130,000 Serbs who returned to Croatia after the war were from Serbia and how many were from the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The number of Serbian refugees in the Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina) has remained relatively stable for several years (between 25,000 and 35,000 persons)."
"The Croatian authorities have made their return impossible mainly by failing to resolve issues such as the return of property, housing, tenancy rights, pensions and so on."
"Croatia, as a candidate country since 2003, when it submitted its application, has completed the demanding preparation for EU membership."
"This process requires profound reforms which are often highly unpopular with the public."
"As a representative for Slovakia, which completed this demanding process only seven years ago, I admire Croatia, and believe that Croatia will complete the remaining 10 chapters as soon as possible."
"Since the break-up of Yugoslavia and the end of the military conflict, Croatia has made great progress in a short space of time in infrastructure, services and tourism, which is the dominant branch of the country's national economy."
"As a tourist who visits Croatia every year, I think Croatia belongs within the family of EU states, and I will join my colleagues in supporting Croatian accession."
"in writing. - (HU) Croatia is one step away from the fulfilment of its historic goal."
"The question is what this step will be like."
"Will it be a long step fraught with obstacles, perhaps even artificial ones?"
"Or will it be an easier, shorter step, one that is based on cooperation and one that appreciates the performance of the difficult commitments undertaken so far?"
"The Croatian people have done considerable work to ensure the conclusion of the accession negotiations, and the recognition of their cooperation is well deserved, whether it be for their efforts in the reduction of corruption, conflicts of interest and organised crime, or for the improvement of their neighbourhood policy."
"Some questions, of course, still remain open to this day, most of them being of a bilateral nature, but it is important to stress that these should not be confused with European matters."
"I am convinced that Croatia is worthy of becoming a Member State of the EU, and is worthy of successfully concluding the negotiations during the term of the Hungarian Presidency."
"The position of Croatia in the Western Balkans is of strategic importance."
"This role is reinforced by the three agreements signed by Croatia and the Hungarian Government on the strengthening of energy supply security, joint research in cross-border hydrocarbon fields and the storage of oil supplies."
"I honestly wish for the Croatian people that all natural - and perhaps artificially erected - barriers are removed from the path of their accession, because Croatia is not only mature enough for, but also worthy of joining the EU."
"What I ask of you, my fellow Members, is to contribute with your supporting votes to Croatia joining the EU as soon as possible, because that way, the accession would be achieved in the symbolic 20th year of Croatia's independence."
"in writing. - (HU) The acceleration of the Croatian accession negotiations brings the possibility of EU integration in the South-East European region within reach."
"Not only Croatia, but the other countries of the Western Balkans, too, are looking with optimism towards their future in Europe."
"This, in turn, will bring about stability, and the irreversibility of the process of democratisation, and economic growth in this region, which carries a heavy historic legacy."
"I commend the efforts of the Croatian Government in combating corruption, ensuring the proper use of EU funds and endeavouring to conclude the chapters of the negotiations that are still open."
"Significant progress has also been made in improving relations with neighbouring countries."
"I consistently support the EU accession of Croatia taking place as soon as possible, because, as a Romanian Member of Hungarian nationality, I have been closely monitoring the fate of the Hungarian community in Croatia."
"It would be to my great satisfaction if we could soon welcome another Hungarian community living outside their home country into the European Union."
"The European Parliament must clearly support Croatia's accession efforts."
"It is not the easing of requirements that is needed, but the facilitation of meeting those requirements."
"I agree with my fellow Members who are asking the European Commission to specify the further dates for the conclusion of the process as soon as possible, and to close the accession chapters while we are still in the term of the Hungarian Presidency."
"The Hungarian Presidency's intention to conclude the negotiations in the first half of 2011 makes us very optimistic about the future of the Balkan region and about the accession of those countries to the European Union."
"The Croatian Government has gone to great lengths to tackle the process of reform and protection of human rights."
"Improvements are still required on some points to ensure that Croatia can be considered ready for the European Union and the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 Strategy: the fight against corruption, protection of minorities, including Italian minorities, shortening the duration of judicial proceedings, support for court infrastructure and equipment, strengthening of tax reforms and public spending cuts."
"If Croatia continues to implement all the reforms necessary for the completion of the acquis communautaire, then from next autumn the European Union will have a valuable addition to help increase its wealth and ensure geopolitical balance between East and West, starting from the Mediterranean region and the north-east of Italy."
"The development of European macro-regions, from the Adriatic and Ionian region, which will include Italy, will quickly bring Croatia into the heart of European programmes and policies."
"in writing. - (PL) Croatia's accession to the European Union is the subject of lively public debate."
"The country is an extremely attractive destination for European tourists, yet it also has problems to contend with. I would like to note that Croatia still faces many challenges and many state reforms, which should be carried out effectively so that the country can meet the EU's requirements as soon as possible."
"An enlargement policy which facilitates the consolidation of democracy, particularly in the Balkan countries, should however also be in the interests of the European Union."
"The European Parliament should be positive in its assessment of the changes made in Croatia to date, since the country is demonstrating a great deal of willingness to resolve its internal problems."
"We must be open to new Member States."
"I hope that the pace of negotiations will make it possible for the Croatians to sign the Treaty of Accession during the Polish Presidency, since this country deserves to be a member of the European Union. Thank you."
"Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - Europe 2020 - Implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States (debate)"
"Τhe next item is the joint debate on"
"the Council and Commission statements on Europe 2020;"
"the report by Pervenche Berès, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States - C7-0033/2011 -;"
"the Commission statement on the implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I very much welcome this opportunity to appear before you to talk about a subject which is of particular importance for the Hungarian Presidency: the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Indeed, it is of particular importance for all of us."
"It is clear that Europe has to overcome a number of serious challenges if it wishes to remain competitive with the rest of the world."
"Some of these challenges have been generated by the financial and economic crisis, but some of them are inherent in our limited capacities and determination to fulfil the objectives and targets of the 2010 Lisbon Strategy."
"As is often said, crisis can be an opportunity - both in the Ancient Greek and in the Chinese interpretation."
"It can be an opportunity for a breakthrough, for a solution and to make progress."
"That is why we believe that the crisis is currently a key factor in motivating Member States to adopt quickly a new European strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"This is the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"I am convinced that this strategy will play an important role in helping Europe recover from the crisis and emerge stronger, both internally and at international level, by boosting productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic governance."
"This is essential if we are going to be able to remain competitive globally, not least in the face of rapidly growing markets in Asia."
"It is also essential if we are to maintain the social model, our way of life, which is a key characteristic of Europe, dear to us all, and which we must preserve."
"The 2020 Strategy confirmed five EU headline targets which constitute shared objectives guiding the action of Member States and the Union as regards promoting employment, improving the conditions for innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty."
"As part of meeting these targets, the Commission developed and presented seven flagship initiatives containing the actions it proposes to take to strengthen the single market and to boost growth and jobs: the Digital Agenda for Europe, Innovation Union, Youth on the Move, Resource Efficient Europe, an Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, an Agenda for New Skills and Jobs and the European Platform against Poverty."
"For each initiative, both the EU and national authorities have to coordinate their efforts so that action at national and European level is mutually reinforcing."
"In December 2010, the first implementation report prepared by the Presidency, in close cooperation with the Commission and the incoming Hungarian Presidency, provided an overview of work undertaken since the launch of the strategy in June."
"The report highlights the most important work done in the Council, in all its forms, regarding the seven flagship initiatives."
"Furthermore, the report stresses the technologies progress achieved in the various policy areas which play a major role in the new strategy: the single market, cohesion policy and agricultural policy."
"It also lists the activities and initiatives that have been conducted at EU level in the last six months as regards the five EU headline targets."
"Let me emphasise some important elements concerning economic governance."
"The implementation of economic governance reform is a fundamental condition for fighting the crisis and boosting the European economy."
"This is why the 2020 Strategy is closely linked with what is known as the 'European semester': a new key instrument of macroeconomic surveillance, to be applied for the first time under this presidency."
"This new process started in January 2011 with the presentation of the Commission's annual growth survey."
"The Hungarian Presidency is paying particular attention to ensuring that the European semester runs smoothly and successfully."
"To that end, we will organise a series of debates in all relevant Council meetings in the run-up to the March European Council."
"The General Affairs Council has, in particular, been tasked with preparing a synthesis report for its meeting of 21 March, which will set out the main messages on the work being undertaken in the various sectoral councils."
"This report will be presented to the European Council in March and will form the basis for the discussions, with the aim of agreeing on a set of priorities for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation."
"Following on from the March European Council, Member States will finalise the drafting of the national reform programmes and stability or convergence reports, which will be submitted to the Commission in April."
"After that, work should be taken forward with a view to elaborating country-specific recommendations which the Member States will take into account when finalising their budgets for 2012 and implementing their growth strategies."
"I recognise that this calendar is very tight, but we hope to complete it by June or July."
"The 2020 Strategy is key in ensuring the future economic success of the European Union."
"It is closely linked to economic governance reform, which will also play a key role."
"Unless we remain competitive and can secure strong growth in the future, we will find it increasingly difficult both to maintain a sufficiently high level of social protection internally and to bring Europe's voice to bear on events externally."
"This is the major challenge for Europe in the years to come."
"I am absolutely sure that we can count on the support of the European Parliament to help us deliver."
"Mr President-in-Office, thank you for your introductory speech."
"We are talking about a very important issue: the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"We are in a crisis and the unemployment rate is very high, which is the biggest threat for our citizens."
"Employment policy is therefore absolutely crucial, including under the 2020 Strategy."
"We welcome the Commissioner responsible for that area, Mr László Andor, to the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as you know, the Commission adopted the first Annual Growth Survey in connection with the Europe 2020 Strategy last month."
"The Annual Growth Survey makes a break with the past and sets in motion the first cycle of economic policy coordination under the European Semester."
"The main idea behind the European Semester is very simple: to ensure the stability of economic and monetary union, we have no choice but to carry out ex-ante coordination of economic policies within the EU."
"The recent debt crisis in some euro area countries illustrates this all too clearly."
"This more robust and demanding approach shows that the European Union recognises how closely interlinked the Member States' economies are and how policy choices in one Member State can have an impact on the others."
"Managing the European Semester will be a real test for the EU."
"Strengthening political ownership of the Strategy and local partnerships has been a key priority for us."
"The challenge now is to demonstrate that the Union can collectively identify the key policy reforms most urgently needed and provide the right policy responses."
"The Annual Growth Survey is very clear about the top priorities."
"It sets out an integrated approach to recovery with 10 priority actions under three main headings: first, a rigorous fiscal consolidation and restructuring of the financial sector to step up macroeconomic stability; second, structural reforms for higher employment; and finally, growth-enhancing measures."
"We have taken good note of your concerns on the key messages of the Annual Growth Survey, to the effect that they may seem to depart from the Integrated Guidelines."
"However, I want to be clear on this."
"The Commission has deliberately chosen to focus this year's Annual Growth Survey on the most immediate challenges stemming from the current economic crisis and on the need to frontload the reforms that are necessary for economic recovery and job creation."
"The Annual Growth Survey is fully consistent with the Integrated Guidelines, including the Employment Guidelines."
"I welcome Parliament's support to the Commission's proposal to maintain the Employment Guidelines unchanged for 2011."
"Indeed, it is vital to ensure a stable policy framework until the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy in 2014 for Member States to have enough time to implement the necessary reforms."
"The Employment Guidelines also provide the basis for the draft Joint Employment Report (part of the Annual Growth Survey), which identifies the most urgent measures in the area of employment, including: first, introducing employment-friendly taxation systems, namely by shifting taxes away from labour; second, reducing labour market segmentation; third, removing barriers to balancing private and work life; fourth, supporting unemployed people, through high-quality training and job search services, to get back into work and go into self-employment; and finally, increasing the participation of older workers in labour markets."
"More importantly, the Employment Guidelines will form the basis for possible country-specific recommendations which the Council may address to Member States on the basis of Article 148 of the Treaty."
"The Annual Growth Survey provides the basis for discussion at the Spring European Council in March and for the economic policy guidance to be addressed to the Member States."
"The Commission expects the Member States to take this guidance into account when they draft their stability or convergence programmes and the national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The Commission will examine the national reform programmes, which are due in the second half of April."
"On the basis of that examination and in line with the Treaty, we will propose country-specific policy guidance and recommendations that Member States should take into account when finalising their budgets for 2012."
"The policy guidance and recommendations should be adopted by the Council before the summer."
"Let me close by stressing the importance of your role in the successful implementation of Europe 2020 and specifically the seven flagship initiatives."
"Your role as co legislator is fundamental to their successful implementation."
"Setting the right framework conditions is vital if we are to meet the Europe 2020 targets."
"Discussion of the new multiannual financial framework will start soon."
"The Commission will present its proposals by June."
"Your role as a budgetary authority together with the Council will be crucial to ensuring that the Europe 2020 priorities are reflected in the EU budget."
"If we are to be credible we need to make sure our financial priorities are in line with our strategies and political priorities."
"At a time of fiscal constraints, it is more important than ever to show that the EU has added value and that a euro spent at EU level can have a greater impact than a euro spent at national level."
"To ensure the success of Europe 2020 we need political ownership at all levels."
"Only if everyone plays their part can we achieve our objectives and set the right course for future growth."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to say how much I welcome this first opportunity to debate the European Semester and the importance that should be given, in this semester, to the Annual Growth Survey."
"Within this framework, you, Commissioner, along with the members of the College, have decided to renew the Employment Guidelines and this Parliament intends to acknowledge that decision."
"We would simply like to draw your attention to three points."
"The first concerns the content of this Annual Growth Survey."
"We are struck by the fact that the issues of employment and unemployment appear to be secondary to budgetary consolidation objectives."
"When you raise these issues, which are directly linked to the operation of the labour market, we feel that you are breaching the social contract between the people of the Member States and their governments."
"You are proposing that the retirement age should be raised, that the amount paid in unemployment allowance should be reduced, that wage levels and the mechanisms for calculating these should be modified, and that shops should be allowed to open on Sundays."
"We believe that this constitutes an extremely dangerous breach of the social contract."
"We also believe that greater attention should be paid to the most vulnerable populations, whether they are young people, women, older people or the disabled."
"We also think that there is a considerable danger of seeing budgetary consolidation as the be-all and end-all of this Annual Growth Survey."
"Our second concern is the fact that, as you have said yourself, you are going to draw up national reform programmes on the basis of this Annual Growth Survey."
"However, it is here that important matters will be decided."
"How are you putting the debate in Parliament on those issues to good use, now that the guidelines are being renewed?"
"How do you envisage democratic debate on this issue?"
"How do you join up Article 148, which coordinates employment policies, with Article 12, which coordinates economic policies?"
"There is a great deal of confusion today for the European Parliament, insofar as we are considering at the same time, the Europe 2020 Strategy, President Van Rompuy's working parties, the package on economic governance, into which this Parliament is putting a great deal of effort, and a revision of the Treaty to maintain a European financial stability mechanism."
"Moreover, while this is in train, we are also debating the possible amendment of that mechanism."
"You are launching the European semester at the same time as Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy are launching the competitiveness pact."
"At the same time as all this, you are renewing the Employment Guidelines, which in all likelihood will be no more than a very vague space to be defined in these national programmes."
"So, Commissioner, I would like to alert you to a third concern of ours."
"When, last year, with the support of the Belgian Presidency, we managed to change the direction of the Employment Guidelines, there was one point on which we placed great emphasis: the issue of governance."
"What do we mean by this governance?"
"It means that economic and social policies cannot be conducted successfully if they are not accompanied by genuine democratic debate."
"Now, democratic debate means giving power to the European Parliament, power to national parliaments and genuinely respecting, involving and including social partners."
"We often have the impression that your proposals ignore these elements, which are part and parcel of the democratic life of our countries."
"I believe that, unless we get to grips with this issue, we are in danger of being inconsistent, of turning our people away from what we are trying to achieve together and of neglecting that which is the key to our success, namely the Community spirit."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Mr President, we are moving into a new era of economic governance."
"The European Semester offers a structure into which the existing tools of the Integrated Guidelines, provided for under Articles 121 and 148 of the Treaty, should be incorporated, with the strong involvement of Parliament."
"Looking wider, it is in the Semester that monitoring of the Stability and Growth Pact and macroeconomic surveillance can join up with the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Integrated Guidelines."
"This means that the Semester can provide a coherent framework for the various economic governance processes in the Union in a mutually enhancing fashion."
"More broadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises that economic governance must be based on the Community method."
"Processes must be transparent and accountable if they are to connect with, and have the support of, citizens."
"This mandates the involvement of Parliament."
"Where Parliament already has been given a role, it must have the time required to fulfil its democratic mandate."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stands shoulder to shoulder with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in pursuing that demand."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the financial and economic crisis has made it painfully clear that our competitiveness, and consequently the sustainability of our social market economy, is at risk."
"That is why we now need to draw lessons from the crisis, if we are to make better use of our internal market, bolster the sustainability of our pensions and also enable the labour market to function better."
"Our group therefore welcomes the Annual Growth Survey and the Ecofin conclusions of 15 January 2011, which encourage ambitious expectations for the European Semester."
"All of us in this house want a Europe of sustainable economic growth with healthy businesses and enough jobs for all our citizens."
"We can only achieve that with a stable currency and a stable economy."
"In order to attain both, the Member States must keep their domestic finances in order, because that will not only help us prevent problems such as those we are currently witnessing in Member States which are struggling with soaring deficits and debt, but also lay the foundation for growth and jobs for our citizens, and also for our children and future generations."
"Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will continue to work for a strong European economic governance package, based on three pillars: a robust Stability and Growth Pact, ambitious macroeconomic surveillance and an ambitious Europe 2020 Strategy."
"However, that demands that we use the community method and involve the European Parliament and national parliaments."
"If we do that, we will not need a new competitiveness pact, because we will have already achieved our objective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have listened closely to what you have said, I have read the Annual Growth Survey, I have read the Ecofin conclusions and now I am absolutely clear about one thing: the European Union is not only experiencing an economic crisis, it is also experiencing a political crisis."
"What you are recommending to us is nothing new."
"Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years."
"The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high."
"I have not seen any other recommendations."
"Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom - it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality."
"Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime."
"We want to get to know your economic models."
"We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession."
"Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about."
"I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments - when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford - why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis."
"There is nothing about any of these things in your documents."
"You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe."
"However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, a year ago we debated here in this Chamber what actions were necessary to tackle the global financial crisis."
"At the time, some of my Group's proposals on economic governance were dismissed as too ambitious and too far-reaching, but today I am happy to note that several of our suggestions are realities."
"Today, however, there is a significant gap between the ambitions declared in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the financial resources needed to attain the goals."
"In the draft 2012 budget, the Commission needs to clarify, clearly identify and make visible the expenditure related to the Strategy."
"This is also true for the upcoming revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework."
"I would also like to address the Member States directly."
"There is a clear unwillingness in the Council among the Finance Ministers - including my own, Anders Borg from Sweden - to invest in the future."
"National budgets need to reflect the Council's stated ambitions, and EU projects need budgets if they are ever to happen."
"Mark my words, without the money in the right place there will be no growth and jobs strategy, and we risk failure."
"I therefore urge the Commission to come forward with more concrete legislative proposals and the Member States to show more commitment."
"We need binding commitments to reach headline targets and legislation in key job-creating areas, such as energy efficiency targets at a common European level."
"Existing initiatives, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, have already been adopted, but you in the Council failed to bring the money to the table."
"We need financing of these projects."
"They all have the potential to create jobs and growth."
"With our 2020 resolution, the ALDE Group sends a strong message to the Council that the current governance structure is too weak, the method of open coordination has failed and the Community method should be restored."
"I applaud the huge majority behind the joint resolution."
"This is a strong message from Parliament that we need action."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, you know that the Greens are strong supporters of a more integrated Europe in order to be able to ensure sustainable development for our citizens, but also in order to ensure the possibility of Europe to mean something on this planet in the 21st century."
"- (FR) Our confidence has today been seriously shaken by an act of yours, namely the Annual Growth Survey, because here you have revealed an ideological bias which has nothing to do with the facts of the matter and everything to do with ideological choices."
"What exactly is your recommendation?"
"To cut public expenditure!"
"You do not get stable public finances by cutting expenditure."
"There is no talk of revenues."
"The aim is also to increase flexibility, to reform, as you will argue, the labour markets - in other words, to clearly create flexisecurity without the security."
"You will argue that we must take these measures to enable the economy to recover."
"However, that is not all."
"There are also measures for the financial sector."
"Let us talk about those, because this is a good example of double standards."
"What do you have to say about the measures on pay and public expenditure?"
"We must strike soon and strike hard."
"However, when it comes to the financial sector, you say that we have to look at things, examine the impact, and, above all, have transition periods."
"In the case of economic governance and budgetary consolidation, you are quick to state: 1 January 2011 -1 January 2012."
"For the banks, it will be 1 January 2019, just as if no study or transition period were needed to help the labour markets adapt or to put public finances on a stable footing."
"Can you tell me what Europe 2020 has to do with all that?"
"This is, after all, the issue but it is not what you are telling me about."
"Europe 2020, Commissioner, Members of the Council, is rendered absolutely impossible by the recommendations you are making within the Annual Growth Survey."
"You are taking us for a ride when you pretend that it is possible to conduct the necessary investment policies in the areas of research, education, poverty reduction, the fight against climate change, and employment by conducting the policies that you are recommending."
"That is a lie, and in my view this debate is a farce."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, my group has signed, and will support, this resolution."
"I am not saying we agree with everything in it, but we endorse the core passage."
"I want to put this to both Commission and Council and will read out the headline that we have agreed: 'A bold single market act and small business act to create jobs'."
"Now where are the jobs going to come from?"
"They are going to come from private investment enterprise and new business start-ups."
"We already know that small enterprises have been the main engine of job creation over the last decade."
"My message to both the Commission and Council today is that all 27 Member States have got to start taking job creation enterprise seriously at the level of the single market."
"We all believe in the single market and Member States have invested huge amounts of money and resources in opening up the services market, but have they told their businesses about it?"
"Have they promoted the single market?"
"Have they encouraged enterprise?"
"Have they encouraged online trading?"
"Why do they not get down to doing these practical things to unleash the power of what we already have, alongside all the other projects that my colleagues have talked about?"
"They need to start on that tomorrow, today even, rather than talk about some of the other longer-term projects."
"They should get down to work!"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Harms mentioned something important yesterday."
"Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations."
"One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis."
"Quite the contrary - it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place."
"It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms."
"In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens."
"It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts."
"Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible - all of this means wage restraint and cuts."
"It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society."
"In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt."
"It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey."
"This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support."
"However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy."
"Yesterday's debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point."
"We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century."
"Nobody wants that."
"Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Energy 2020 is a vast programme, but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20% renewable energy by the due date, not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment."
"There remains one problem: supporting solar energy."
"Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world's leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment."
"Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities."
"Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management."
"Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies."
"We should remember that the production of CO2 from cars has not dropped for 150 years."
"We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines."
"(NL) Mr President, if we are to implement the employment chapter of the Europe 2020 Strategy, it is of the utmost importance that we make adjustments to the immigration policy of most Member States and that of the EU."
"As the Commission's proposal itself states, the priorities include increasing labour market participation, reducing structural unemployment, the development of skilled manpower to meet the needs of the labour market, lifelong learning and so on."
"The large-scale importation of workers from outside the European Union bears witness to a short-term vision and is out of kilter with the priorities I have just mentioned."
"Some 25 million people in the European Union are unemployed."
"Let us start by helping those people into work first, instead of resorting once again to large-scale immigration."
"Bringing skilled workers into Europe, or what we might describe as a brain drain, creates even greater problems in their countries of origin, which only serves to further crank up the immigration of unskilled people into Europe."
"This is a vicious circle and we need to recognise that no one stands to benefit from this situation in the long term."
"It is high time that we made a cost-benefit analysis of immigration from outside the EU."
"That aspect, too, should be part of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States."
"(RO) Mr President, the Europe 2020 Strategy features objectives which cannot be achieved without attaching suitable importance to areas which are not explicitly mentioned in it."
"A dynamic and competitive agricultural sector is required in Europe, which can make an effective contribution in terms of boosting sustainable, smart growth that is also conducive to inclusion."
"Reliable food production, sustainable management of natural resources and maintaining the territorial balance and diversity of rural areas are key elements of an effective common agricultural policy and of a productive agricultural sector."
"Industrial policy needs to have an infrastructure."
"Implementing a single railway area is a vital step towards deregulating rail transport."
"The completion of the Single European Sky and speedy implementation of the SESAR project are just as important."
"One of the most important factors is the development of trans-European networks, not only in the transport but also in the energy sector, by allocating sufficient financial resources to value-added projects for Europe."
"The Nabucco project, for instance, will deliver benefits for all Member States by removing the European Union's dependency on a single source."
"(SV) Madam President, if we are to be able to start over after the economic crisis, it is vital that people have confidence."
"Richard Wilkinson, the British researcher who has written the book 'The Spirit Level' and who visited the European Parliament in Brussels last week, has described it very well: we need equality and we need small gaps in order for us to have societies where security and confidence reign."
"This can be translated directly into the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Firstly, if we want to succeed, employees and their trade union organisations must be involved and respected."
"At the moment, however, the crisis is instead being used to attack trade unions, employees and free wage formation and to strike at unemployment benefits and pensions."
"These attacks must stop."
"Secondly, we women in Europe must, of course, have the same opportunities as men."
"This is not always evident in Parliament's resolutions, but it needs to be evident in practice."
"Thirdly, a strong, modern industry and industrial policy and far-sighted investments, including in infrastructure, must play a central role in our work going forward."
"The work on climate-smart, resource-efficient processes and products, green energy and green jobs must be stepped up."
"How else are we going to compete?"
"Fourthly, we need to have clear support for the energy efficiency policy."
"We know that we will not meet our current targets because they are not binding."
"We must have binding targets, because that is vital to enable us to achieve the targets for growth and competitiveness that are the main elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The low level of ambition and the lack of political will are astounding, particularly as energy efficiency measures are one of the best and smartest ways to reduce financial costs for consumers, strengthen companies and really make a difference."
"Madam President, if we want the Europe 2020 Strategy to be a success, then the Employment Guidelines have to be implemented effectively, and national reform programmes put in place and given the priority they actually deserve."
"We have to make sure that no one is left behind."
"Unemployment rates among older people and disabled people are disgracefully high."
"I am pleased that both texts refer to the need to implement anti-discrimination laws in the workplace so that jobs are open for all."
"It is important that the targets we have agreed at EU level are actually achieved."
"Yes, it is up to Member States to set specific targets and adhere to them, but the European Union has an important role to play in improving the exchange of best practice."
"That is why I am pleased that paragraph 27 of the committee resolution makes this very clear."
"We have had months of introspection and debates about what shape the Europe 2020 Strategy should take, but we have the Employment Guidelines."
"Now is the time to start delivering on them."
"(DA) Madam President, there is a great deal of talk about economic responsibility in Europe these days, and economic responsibility is very often identified by cuts in public expenditure and very rarely by an improvement in the employment situation."
"I believe that we should ask ourselves what economic responsibility actually means."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance see a very large discrepancy between the policies pursued in Europe and those pursued in the Member States right now."
"On the one hand, we can see the Annual Growth Survey, and we can see the European Semester leading to fewer jobs and less growth in Europe."
"On the other hand, in the Europe 2020 Strategy and in the Employment Guidelines we say that we want to create more and better jobs."
"There is inconsistency here."
"It is a fact that we have 23 million unemployed in Europe."
"We have 5.5 million unemployed below the age of 25."
"We have increasing numbers of poor workers."
"The figures are rising, and the economic policies that we are pursuing are not improving the situation."
"I believe that, if we want to create new jobs in Europe, it is vital that we truly implement the Europe 2020 Strategy and the guidelines for employment in our economic policies."
"That would be a demonstration of economic responsibility, but I doubt that it will actually happen."
"(EL) Madam President, poverty, climate change, low birth rates, immigration, energy and, more importantly, combating unemployment are the main problems we face today in the European Union."
"Addressing them takes money and needs appropriations."
"However, unfortunately, funding is being cut back throughout Europe."
"What does this mean?"
"It means that the Europe 2020 Strategy is at risk and will be hard to achieve."
"However, we must try."
"I think that we need to pay particular attention to unemployment, which has risen to a ten-year high."
"I also think that we need to provide a high standard of education to young people in Europe, in keeping with the needs of the labour market, and that courses should be revised and Member States should commit to reducing the school dropout rate."
"Job vacancies need specialised labour."
"I call on Europe to adopt without delay the proposed European vacancy monitoring system, which will also include a European skills passport."
"We must succeed."
"Words are not enough."
"We need action."
"(ES) Madam President, this issue raises a question, just one question: at European level what can we do to give work to those who do not have it?"
"To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point."
"There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy."
"Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow."
"The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action."
"What are we going to do?"
"How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions?"
"Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced?"
"The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth."
"To date this picture does not yet exist."
"What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas."
"There are three important actions to be taken."
"Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds."
"Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy."
"Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank's resources, two thirds of which are the Commission's, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy."
"(EL) Madam President, the EU has been debating an efficient, cohesive and viable response to the crisis for several months now, a response that will ensure that our strategic objectives of viable growth, protection for employment, social progress and social cohesion will be attained."
"However, there are two problems: firstly, the debate on the Europe 2020 Strategy is still cut off, structurally, from the economic governance package, from the European Semester and from the Annual Growth Survey and, as a result, we have either a fragmented strategy or parallel strategies, strategies which run in tandem, without adequate coordination, which thus risk undermining each other."
"The second problem is that the Council's and the Commission's current emphasis is on tightening up the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary discipline and reform, with no convincing answers or solutions for the effective implementation and financing of the Europe 2020 Strategy objectives."
"I think that there is a risk, as happened with the Lisbon Strategy, that many of our objectives will get no further than the drawing board and I worry that this will happen unless we are able to put persuasive arguments to the people of Europe, who are bearing the brunt of the crisis, who cannot and should not have to follow technical debates on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and on indicators and penalties."
"We must understand that we cannot focus solely on indicators and figures."
"We must focus on people."
"(FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, if you would be so kind as to listen to what I have to say, Commissioner, I have only one minute of speaking time, even though I have a good mind to keep quiet, and to say nothing, since I believe that this Europe 2020 Strategy is very far removed from what we need."
"You have given us a lot of fine words."
"Do you really think that guidelines, 'flagships' and all manner of things that you dream up and which keep you busy for hours and days at a time will enable you to provide employment and give confidence to the people of Europe?"
"You are wrong."
"If you look at the state of the world today, I do not think that the Chinese, the Indians or the emerging countries are very impressed with what we are doing about growth."
"Therefore, in my capacity as rapporteur on the economic governance package, I am almost inclined to keep quiet in your presence, and I would like to say just one thing to you: in our work, we shall be extremely firm."
"Do not think that if you Council Members simply tell us to speed up, we will have an agreement in June."
"We will have an agreement when this Parliament has held debates and when the Council has listened to us."
"As far as I am concerned, the creation of Eurobonds, which could create a global market backed up by the euro, is part of this package."
"(NL) Madam President, whenever I hear the word 'eurobonds', I always feel a little bit sick, even though it is a word which is frequently bandied about here."
"Most jobs come from economic growth and a healthy private sector."
"There is no alternative to that."
"Governments do not create jobs and are not job creators."
"The major problem in Europe is the lack of competitiveness."
"The difference between Germany and southern Europe is almost 35%."
"That gap is very large, which is why Mrs Merkel has spoken of a competitiveness pact."
"I agree with that, in itself."
"Actually, the Lisbon Process was supposed to be an idea along those lines, but little has come of that."
"However, there is one thing I would like to warn you about, and that is the harmonisation of corporation tax."
"That is a very bad idea."
"It is also a very French idea, and we must dismiss it, just as we must dismiss the idea of an economic government."
"It will be a job killer."
"Last week, a study conducted by the OECD in 21 countries showed, once again, that if we want greater employment in Europe, we need to lower corporation tax."
"That is the sort of thing we need to be looking into, because this Parliament does not create any jobs."
"(DE) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a major economic crisis - we have been talking about this for months and everything we have said is true - as a rule, however, we tend to talk in very broad terms and then cheerfully continue to make decisions here as if nothing is happening."
"I believe this is because here in Parliament we do not act in a specific enough way and we are not honest enough, but rather pursue something resembling a general, headlines policy."
"What are we actually doing to promote growth and stability?"
"Are we ourselves actually contributing to a more proper and wiser way of dealing with finances?"
"Are we really carrying out a critical review of whether we are making the right kinds of expenditure, or does every one of us not have a new idea every day about where we could spend more money?"
"If we do not have the strength to focus our financial resources on projects for the future - and that will involve altercations, debates and decisions - then there is no point in talking about innovation and research only to then fail to make the necessary funds available."
"That is rather dishonest."
"If we want to breathe life into the economy, we must also pursue a policy that stimulates the economy and not endlessly sit thinking about how we can interfere with industry or the economy."
"We cheerfully take more decisions - even today we are constantly calling for new decisions that will interfere with the development of the economy."
"Does anyone believe that the question of mandatory energy efficiency - to name just one example - will help to drive the economy forward?"
"Do you really believe that, with the decisions we have often made in connection with energy, we have stimulated the economy?"
"Or have we obstructed it?"
"I would like us for once to talk a bit more honestly about this and then to make somewhat fewer decisions, but perhaps ones that will really bring about progress."
"That will be more challenging and it will take more effort, but it is in the interests of democracy."
"(HU) Madam President, the financial and economic crisis has transformed into becoming a social and employment crisis, which is why it is particularly important that the realisation Europe has come to, namely that tighter coordination is necessary in both economic and employment policy, is actually implemented."
"This also means that all countries that introduce structural reforms or changes in fiscal policy or, for example, review the Sunday opening hours of shops, must also examine whether such measures facilitate the development of the employment system and contribute to increasing the employment rate."
"It is also crucial in all decisions to consult with social partners."
"The European Semester will be the first real test to this realisation, when Europe together, led by the Hungarian Presidency, will be able to assess for the first time the degree to which these directives can be transposed, and whether we will be able to embark on the path of implementation."
"I believe that the Hungarian Presidency and the Hungarian Government has a special role in this, not only in its position of presidency, but also in leading by example, in taking this into account in all economic policy changes and all employment policy decisions, and in providing an example to the other countries."
"(The Member agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(HU) Madam President, I am under the impression that Mrs Göncz has a very good understanding of this whole issue, that is, how the European Union intends to put an end to unemployment."
"I have been sitting through this whole debate here and still do not understand it any better."
"Please help me answer this question: what are we supposed to tell the people in Borsod or Szabolcs County?"
"Where and when will they find work?"
"And I expect an answer to the very same question, from Mr Martonyi, by the way, who is here representing the Council, as well as from the Commissioner, who is fortunately also of Hungarian nationality."
"Where will the Hungarian people and, for that matter, people in other regions of Europe that are in a catastrophic situation, find work?"
"Where and when?"
"I expect a concrete answer."
"We need to be consistent in our exercise of the right to ask a blue-card question."
"A blue-card question is not addressed to plenary in general or to the Commissioner or the Council representative."
"It is addressed to a colleague expounding a matter on which you would like to ask for clarification."
"Mrs Morvai, that was not the spirit of your question."
"(HU) Madam President, I would be happy to answer, but obviously our time is too short to discuss this in too much detail."
"However, what I had in mind was, for example, that if there is a change in the tax system, does that tax change reduce social differences; does it help companies continue development and job creation, or does it instead urge them to hold back on their intentions of creating jobs?"
"What I was referring to is that if we are speaking of a restructuring of the educational system, is it really in the service of social integration?"
"If we are speaking of further education, does it really prepare people for the market; for the labour market?"
"This is what I was specifically referring to."
"(FI) Madam President, our fellow Member on the right insisted that policy only interferes with the economy and that people in this House only do things that interfere with policy."
"Does my fellow Member really think that economic governance, for example, only interferes with the economy?"
"(The speaker puts the question to Mr Reul by raising a blue card under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(DE) If you take a look at the measures that have been adopted here in the last few months and calculate the costs that have resulted from these, they have - not always, but very often - contributed to the disruption of economic development."
"Thus, we need to be more careful in our considerations."
"The idea presented by the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship in his industry communications, that we should always gauge future decisions by whether they will serve or damage the competitiveness of European industry, is therefore a very wise one."
"(DE) Madam President, it is clear to everyone here in this Chamber that the closer Europe grows together, the closer the agreement on issues relating to economic policy needs to be."
"Therefore, an instrument like the European Semester makes sense."
"However, it must stop at interfering in tasks that have traditionally been the job of the social partners, such as wage negotiations and negotiating collective agreements."
"We really must exercise restraint in this regard."
"It does not make any sense for Europe to decide how high wages should be in the individual countries."
"We ought to concentrate more on eliminating market obstacles in order to allow the European economy to flourish."
"This relates to oligopolies and monopolies, but also to barriers to market access."
"It should also not be the case that various sectors are assured of particular profit margins."
"More competition is needed here to enable the European economy to develop its potential."
"It must also be the task of the European Union to bring our infrastructure up to the state of the art."
"I am talking here about energy, transport and communications."
"Europe ought to have the necessary resources in this regard, in particular so that we can eliminate the existing bottlenecks between Member States."
"We also need to consider what resources we can make available to Europe."
"This includes a clear basis for our own resources."
"Therefore, I would make a clear appeal to the Council and the Member States at long last to give Europe the resources it needs."
"Clearly this also concerns education, as well as the area of research and development, where, as Europe, we have a part to play."
"However, the question of money is crucial here, too."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Europe 2020 Strategy is very important, not only for the development of European social and economic policy, but also for national social and economic policy."
"We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States."
"I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection."
"Some previous speakers have already talked about this."
"The impact on the people locally will be disastrous."
"It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone."
"I, too, would like to appeal to the Member States to be guided only by the integrated guidelines when they draw up their national reform programmes, as these enable a much better balance between social protection and economic growth."
"The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs."
"Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights."
"Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs."
"We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another."
"Madam President, my reading of the reality of today and of tomorrow is that European jobs will be sustainable only if they are underpinned by a competitive economy, and it is no secret that this not one of our strong points."
"To be successful on competitiveness in Europe, we need an institutionalised competitiveness process."
"We have to identify success factors and we also have to see how to tailor them to the situation."
"We already have a large number of instruments - competitiveness-related instruments - indeed, with a little bit of political will, we can use a substantial part of the institutional framework to launch a Commission-led competitiveness process based on the Community system."
"I am referring here to the European Semester, the growth survey that has already been mentioned."
"I could also mention imbalances and precision - especially in the scoreboard, which should include structural competitiveness-related factors."
"There is also the 2020 Strategy, which should be vigorously implemented now and not after 2013."
"All policies should contribute to improving the competitiveness of the European economy: we need all hands on deck and decoupling Europe's core from the rest of it would simply generate a divided Europe."
"Sustainable jobs can only be created if Europe sticks together."
"A divided Europe will not be a competitive Europe."
"(HU) Madam President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak, both as the rapporteur for the 2010 Employment Guidelines and as the coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal, which intends to maintain the 2010 Employment Guidelines in 2011."
"We are in agreement with this and we support this."
"However, the Treaty of Lisbon requires annual guidelines, and we must therefore indeed track and monitor the changes, maintain contact between each other, between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and must, of course, still make modifications if necessary."
"I therefore recommend that, during the review of the 2020 Strategy and during the work under the European Semester, the Integrated Economic and Employment Guidelines be used as a guide of sorts, and if there are any differences, we should take the trouble and make amendments."
"Problems might very well arise."
"I recently learned that, in the preliminary National Reform Programmes, there has already been a certain slippage in respect of employment commitments, and instead of the 75% target we are looking at commitments of around 72%."
"This obviously needs re-thinking in order to avoid a similar case to that of the Lisbon Strategy, where we undertook too much and then managed to implement little."
"Still, I would advise that some basic principles be laid down."
"I agree on the issue of pensions and wages."
"There should be no intervention, subsidiarity should be respected, and specific national commitments are required with regard to special groups, young people, people with disabilities and people with multiple disadvantages."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(HU) Madam President, I am once again compelled to ask a fellow Hungarian Member a question."
"Does subsidiarity with regard to pensions and wages mean that the pensions and wages of pensioners and employees in Hungary and other post-communist countries will consistently, continuously and permanently be a fraction of those in Western Europe?"
"Because it would be very sad if we were to understand it as such."
"This is the case at the moment."
"Nurses make 70 000 forints a month, and teachers make 90 000; pensioners have basic subsistence difficulties."
"How are we to understand this?"
"(HU) No, Mrs Morvai, this is not how it is to be understood, but the issue of pensions essentially depends on economic performance."
"It depends on what we are able to produce, and it is this on the basis of which we can provide appropriate pensions."
"As such, the strategy we are discussing, the one that intends to make Europe competitive, functional and successful, is what gives us the possibility to increase pensions even in countries that are currently still in a less advantageous situation."
"However, uniform rules cannot be introduced, as there are enormous differences at the moment."
"Obviously, a gradual approach will be needed in the future as well."
"(FR) Madam President, as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy, these Employment Guidelines must address three major challenges."
"The first is to emerge from the crisis through research, innovation and competitiveness so as to ensure a true economic recovery that will enable us to achieve this social recovery."
"The second is to replace a whole generation of wage-earners who are now retiring."
"The third is to be competitive in a globalised economy by freeing companies from a number of tax burdens which hamper them and weigh them down."
"Against this background, we must target three particularly vulnerable groups in society."
"Firstly, young people, and it is absolutely vital that we fight to prevent these young people from leaving school with no qualifications, as this will exclude them permanently from the world of work."
"Young people because we must facilitate their entry into the world of work, and not only on temporary contracts or work experience placements; we must fight against youth unemployment."
"This is a long-term problem which has a considerable impact in the current climate where the crisis that has hit them harder."
"The second target group in society is women, women who fall victim to temporary contracts and who are underpaid."
"The third target group is senior citizens whom we must be able to keep in work."
"We have European tools to help us achieve this, notably the European Social Fund, and I believe that we must rely on this lever."
"(PL) Madam President, almost a year has passed since the Commission presented the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"It has not been an easy time for Europe."
"The Member States are still struggling to cope with the aftermath of the crisis."
"Measures to implement the new strategy have been put on the back burner."
"The ambitious Europe 2020 plans, which include an increase in employment levels to 85%, a 20% reduction in the number of people at risk of poverty and an increase in research spending to 3% appear to be under threat already, less than a year after implementation of the strategy began."
"Unemployment currently stands at 10% in the EU, and there are still no signs of it dropping significantly."
"In fact the opposite is true; if we assume that Europe continues to exit the crisis at the current slow rate, unemployment will rise even further for at least the next few years."
"Low levels of employment create favourable conditions for the spread of poverty and social marginalisation, as confirmed by the Eurobarometer report of June 2010."
"(ES) Madam President, looking towards 2020 and beyond, the EU runs the real systemic risk of losing its ability to compete due to the existence of large economic sectors which are increasingly more technological and powerful."
"We need the capacity to compete: to compete in order to grow, to grow in order to create employment and to create employment in order to protect and safeguard our social model."
"The only indispensible commodity we have is knowledge and we must use that knowledge to innovate, to adapt to changes and, above all, to lead in those changes."
"Therefore, we need to invest much more in universities, in our education system and our research and development in order to be a power in the area in which we can be: knowledge."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, the aims of Europe 2020 are good and ambitious."
"In my speech I would mainly like to focus on what the practical factors are, what the tools are, for taking these aims to grassroots level, which we failed to do with the Lisbon Strategy, for example."
"Firstly, we really need Europe as a whole."
"We need the regions of Europe."
"We have to be able to identify each region's success factors and skills potential."
"We can largely respond to this need through cohesion policy."
"For us to be able to create more jobs, innovative activity, and, in particular, practicebased innovation, we need a cohesion policy that covers the whole of Europe to implement these targets in the regions."
"We also obviously need research and development policy and funding for that sector, but I believe the core issue is effective cohesion policy."
"(PT) Madam President, it is unacceptable that social problems continue to be the poor relation of EU policy, as is the systematic devaluation of the social consequences of budgetary, financial and competition policies that insist on neoliberal dogmas, indifferent to the almost 25 million people unemployed, the almost 30 million people working precarious and poorly paid jobs, and the more than 85 million people living in poverty, while the profits of economic and financial interest groups never stop rising."
"Madam President, I would therefore relay here the cries of indignation expressed by various social organisations during the Citizens' Agora held recently by the European Parliament in Brussels."
"This is the reason for the indignation among millions of workers, unemployed, women and young people who continue to fight against such policies throughout Europe."
"It is time to break with the Stability and Growth Pact, the competitiveness pact and other pacts of this kind."
"People and workers must be respected."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that Parliament must be allowed sufficient time so as to be able to propose the best employment policy guidelines for 2020."
"During a time of crisis such as the one we are experiencing at the moment in Europe, we cannot disregard the needs of our people."
"It is essential to provide aid to families, to young people seeking employment, and to those who find themselves out of work during their career."
"Europe must have the courage to make choices, guaranteeing work first to its own citizens and then to those of third countries, and establishing links between employment offices in the various Member States so that anyone, from any country, can know what jobs are available."
"Particular attention should be paid to border protection so as to prevent an uncontrolled invasion by the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are about to flood into our countries as a result of the political situation in North Africa."
"The integration of third-country nationals should be permitted only through controlled immigration and should be limited to the actual availability of jobs, thus preventing tension and discrimination from occurring at the expense of economic growth and social welfare."
"(DE) Madam President, expectations in relation to the strategy are widely divergent."
"While some people are certain that this is all just hot air and that the strategy is not worth the paper it is written on, we see very dramatic and real scenarios that we will have to face - I am thinking about measures to increase the flexibility of the labour markets."
"These are bringing hoards of poorly qualified, cheap workers to Central Europe, and the result is wage dumping."
"The goal formulated in the strategy for 40% of the younger generation to have a higher education qualification seems particularly naïve."
"I would like to know what the point of that is."
"We already have a situation - I am thinking of Italy - where there are hardly any appropriate jobs for young academics, who have to keep their heads above water by taking low-paid jobs."
"Why do we actually need such a high number of academics when there are no suitable jobs for them?"
"It is true that we need higher qualifications, but we will not achieve that simply by hanging a university degree around the necks of 40% of the population."
"That is not the right way to go."
"(PT) Madam President, I should like to mention that, at a time when there is a severe sovereign and financial debt crisis, it is crucial to commit to economic development through growth and growth strategies and, not least, to have an employment policy in place."
"I believe that, by having an employment policy, we shall not only resolve an economic problem but also a social one."
"I should therefore like to send out a message to a specific category of workers that must be taken into account in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"There has been talk of young people, a lot of which took place just this morning."
"However, there is a category of workers - a crucial generational category of workers - comprising those who are over the age of 50 and therefore close to retirement."
"Should we wish to raise the retirement age and create a more active society, we must adopt a strategy for workers in precarious jobs and for workers over the age of 50 who are experiencing difficulties."
"(RO) Madam President, the Europe 2020 Strategy must pave the way for a new model of economic growth in Europe by promoting structural reforms coordinated at Member State level."
"I think that these reforms are essential for every Member State, given the high level of youth unemployment."
"At the same time, we must support small and medium-sized enterprises in leveraging their full potential with the aim of creating new jobs."
"The inclusion on the European Union's list of objectives of economic growth, the social objective and the fight against poverty is also important for Europe because achieving them will help safeguard the European Union's economic independence."
"Last but not least, I believe that the Europe 2020 Strategy must be accessible to Europe's citizens as they must understand the responsibilities which fall on all the actors involved in implementing this strategy, such as national, local and regional authorities, whose efforts are also supplemented by the contribution from European citizens."
"(PL) Madam President, the Employment Guidelines are and should be treated as a fundamental tool in the process of economic governance as expressed in the concept of the European Semester."
"These guidelines represent a foundation upon which the Member States' National Reform Programmes are currently being constructed, and it is after all these programmes which will determine the success of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"According to the schedule, work on the National Reform Programmes will be completed in April."
"I would like to stress the importance of involving both national parliaments and regional and local authorities in work on the National Reform Programmes, and in this respect I would also like to make reference to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions."
"Making changes to the guidelines at this stage could disrupt the process."
"I would like to draw attention to the need for an integrated horizontal approach to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"I would therefore also like to reiterate the significance of the cohesion policy instruments for the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"- (SK) Madam President, the four guidelines of the Council on employment policy should also remain in force in 2011."
"The guidelines relating to improving qualifications would probably end up being implemented through the principle of supply and demand, even without state intervention."
"Increasing the employment of women does require such intervention, but before we proceed to that, Member States should recognise the work of women as mothers looking after their children, and the benefit this brings to gross domestic product."
"Let us not give work to those who already have enough of it."
"The state should therefore focus on combating poverty and social exclusion, as few people can escape the poverty gap by themselves."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, perhaps you could tell President Barroso that we would have liked him to have taken part in this debate as it is the first debate on the issues at stake in the Annual Growth Survey, the cornerstone of this European Semester that he so very much wanted and which he believes is a key element in getting the European Union out of the crisis."
"Perhaps you could also tell him that, under these conditions, the European Parliament will not be an easy partner and that the economic governance package needs the Commission to pay greater attention to what emerges from this Parliament."
"Finally, you could also tell him that the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, of the entire Treaty of Lisbon, and particularly of Article 9, which requires you to make social issues a horizontal issue, will not go unheeded by this Parliament."
"We are waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon to be applied in full."
"We are constantly being told that a minimum revision of the Treaty is needed and that its potential must be fully exploited."
"As far as the potential of Article 9 is concerned, we sometimes get the impression that the Annual Growth Survey completely ignores it."
"Finally, I should like to tell you what has struck me at the end of the debate."
"We sometimes get the impression that, even after this crisis, people at the European Commission continue to think along 'old lines', believing that the most important thing is to reform the labour market."
"We are well aware that, according to the dominant way of thinking in the European Commission - one that you undoubtedly do not subscribe to - to talk about labour market reforms is to talk about flexibility - not about flexicurity, but about flexibility."
"However, the last 10 years, even before the crisis, have taught us that this mindset - the belief that growth is all it takes to create employment - is no longer enough."
"The real challenge we face is that of employment, whether our own employment or that of the countries around us."
"However, when I see the debate getting under way on the subject of competitiveness, I see a debate that overlooks this priority for employment, and that worries me."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Members for this very substantial, inspirational and stimulating discussion."
"I would like to answer all the major points that have been raised as questions or comments and observations concerning the annual growth survey, the Economic Semester and Europe 2020 in general."
"The most important thing is that we get the picture right, both about the documents and also about the economic situation in the European Union."
"The inconvenient truth is that Europe is experiencing a recovery."
"Last year we already had economic growth in the European Union - but not in every Member State - and that is where the second part of the inconvenient truth comes."
"We are experiencing a very fragile and divided recovery."
"The Commission has looked at this situation very thoroughly and developed policies accordingly."
"We need to maintain and strengthen the recovery, and we have to address the current division."
"This will not, however, be possible without addressing the weaknesses that have been exposed by the crisis in economic and monetary union, which we will do by developing further the architecture of economic and monetary governance in the European Union."
"That is where the complications begin and where it may be true that the priorities are not always immediately recognised by everyone."
"For us, economic growth is the priority and all other policies in this phase serve this."
"We need to strengthen growth and make it more robust, but in order to do this we need a greater level of financial stability, and for that we also need fiscal consolidation."
"It is inevitable that, in the coming years, fiscal consolidation will remain on the agenda in the interests of stabilisation and of being consistent with the kinds of cyclical intervention which the Member States implemented against the recession in previous years."
"We need a smart consolidation which does not undermine demand in the economy and which preserves the integrity of the EU economy as a whole."
"This lesson has to be learned."
"This must begin by stabilising the euro."
"I could obviously use stronger expressions here, but let us just stick to this one."
"We need to stabilise the euro and economic and monetary union."
"The lesson we share is that, in order to do that, we need to strengthen the economic leg of this Union and the economic leg of policy coordination at European level."
"Let me just ask a question and leave it as a question on this."
"The question is whether the strengthening of the economic leg of governance can succeed without a collective effort on wages, on coordinating wage developments in the European Union."
"When I say that, and when we include suggestions in this area in the annual growth survey, it does not mean that we would question the importance of the social dialogue - quite the contrary."
"We have praised countries with a tradition and culture of strong social partnership."
"We recognise that they suffered less from the crisis and, in particular, suffered fewer losses in terms of human resources."
"Unemployment remained lower in these countries."
"We advocate the strengthening of social dialogue in other Member States which have suffered more and which responded to the crisis with less flexibility than countries like Germany, the Netherlands or Austria."
"We have also increased the level of social dialogue at European level."
"We recently held macroeconomic dialogue with the social partners and we will have a new tripartite social forum in March in order to enhance coordination and dialogue with the social partners."
"I would like to reject very categorically the notion that the Commission is doing business as usual."
"In the last year the Commission has introduced a number of qualitatively new initiatives."
"We are pursuing a robust agenda for Financial Regulation."
"Commissioner Barnier's work should not be underestimated."
"As part of Europe 2020, we outlined a new concept for industrial policy at European level which does much more for competitiveness and the sustainability of jobs in the European Union."
"We are pursuing a number of innovative approaches to boost investment and to find funding for it."
"A group of Commissioners has been working to develop innovative financial instruments."
"The first example of this is going to be an outline for supporting developing energy networks in Europe."
"This is absolutely necessary in order to develop the energy markets and the necessary infrastructure that is vital for it."
"We have launched the microfinance facility."
"I am grateful to Parliament and the Council for the final consensus that made this possible last year."
"Just last week I was present in the Netherlands at the launch of the first EU-supported microfinance facility and there are more in the pipeline in order to support potential entrepreneurs, perhaps after the experience of being unemployed: women coming back to the labour market after childbirth or people who have already been working and want to seek a new form of enterprise beyond 50, or even 60."
"When we discuss employment policies - and a good example of this was a couple of weeks ago when the EPSCO Council was hosted by the Hungarian Presidency in Gödöllő - we focus on how to generate job-rich goals, but also on the groups in most difficulty."
"In this case I must mention in particular young people."
"Youth unemployment is very dramatic in some Member States."
"Again we have to be aware of diversity."
"Luckily, there are some Member States where youth unemployment is low, but the European average is too high."
"In some Member States, like Spain and the Baltics, it is at a tragic level."
"The governments have been alerted and a complex set of policies, from education to employment services and other types of measures, is required."
"But youth is not the only problem group."
"It is true that we have to do more with regard to the employment of older workers."
"That is why we designated 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing."
"On the institutional questions concerning the Employment Guidelines - which I believe continue to be our focus and provide guidance and substance - there is a clear role for the European Parliament under Article 148 of the Treaty."
"The Employment Guidelines are to be renewed."
"This is confirmation that we want them to continue until 2014; they should neither be subject to major changes nor overruled by annual growth surveys."
"The guidelines provide long-term orientation, while the growth survey is an annual exercise that concerns its substance."
"But it is obviously true that the NRP exercise is crucial and that the Commission is pursuing it very seriously in the context of Europe 2020."
"Parliament will be involved in the discussions in various ways."
"I should refer here to the multiannual financial framework negotiations."
"The EU budget also has to reflect 2020 priorities and we will keep Parliament informed about the preparation of the national reform programme as the country-specific recommendations develop."
"It is clear that there is concern at this early stage about the future of Europe 2020."
"In a way, a spectre is haunting Europe 2020: that of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I have had many opportunities in this House to discuss why we believe there is a much better chance, through a more focused system of targets and also a more focused system of reporting and implementation, of success with Europe 2020."
"Only the Commission can ensure that there is consistency between these initiatives."
"We have a number of balls in the air and we have to make sure that none of them falls while conducting economic policies: Europe 2020, economic governance, the single market and cohesion policy."
"None of them must be damaged in this exercise."
"All of them need to be pursued in a very robust way, ensuring that all 27 Member States are involved. The Commission is obviously against the concept of a two-speed Europe."
"We have to ensure that the divided recovery which we are experiencing does not turn into political divisions in the coming period."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, first and foremost I would like to thank you all for the very constructive and useful debate."
"I also would like to extend my special thanks to Mrs Perez for her excellent report and the very important observations and criticisms that she made."
"We may have a different reading of the reality, as referred to by Mrs Danuta Hübner, both for a crisis and for the recovery, but I believe that we all agree on one point, and that is that nobody is interested in a jobless recovery."
"We are all striving for a balance between fiscal consolidation and growth and job creation."
"Indeed, fiscal discipline and the raising of employment levels should go hand in hand."
"On a more general note, on economic issues, we all know that now we have a comprehensive approach, a comprehensive 'package' or 'Gesamtpaket', as some people say, most of the elements of which have just been referred to by Commissioner Andor."
"As far as the Presidency is concerned, I would just like to underline again that we have to focus upon two of all the elements of the package."
"One is certainly the implementation and the application of the European Semester."
"This is the first time, it is the first exercise."
"It will have a major impact on the subsequent development of the whole European integration process."
"Just to mention two things briefly."
"One is that we have a very tight schedule, so the deadlines must be respected by all, and the headline targets will have to be achieved."
"We have to make all possible efforts to ensure that the overall deadlines are met through the contributions of the individual Member States, in the fields both of employment and innovation, and of energy."
"Let me just mention, about energy, that there was a very successful meeting of the European Council on 4 February."
"For many of us it represented a kind of breakthrough, both for the establishment of the integrated energy market and for energy efficiency."
"Important decisions were also made with respect to the external aspects of the common energy policy."
"Last but not least, I would just like to mention the fight against poverty, the fight for social inclusion."
"In this respect, I would like to congratulate you on the resolution you have just adopted on Roma integration."
"I would like to extend my very special congratulations and thanks to Lívia Járóka, who played a decisive role in the preparation of the report, and also in the adoption of this extremely important resolution, which will be very helpful for us when we work on and finalise the European framework strategy for Roma integration."
"The other element we want to concentrate upon is the six legislative texts."
"Here I would like to assure Sylvie Goulard that we do not only want to listen to Parliament."
"We indeed would like to have, and we have to make, an agreement with Parliament under the terms of the ordinary legislative process."
"We will have to do everything possible so that this process is accelerated and can be successfully concluded by the end of the Hungarian Presidency."
"I do not want to get into the other elements of the comprehensive package."
"I would just like to underline one thing."
"The Council wants to fully respect the Community method."
"We have no reservations whatsoever in this regard."
"As we said many times before, the Treaty of Lisbon changed many things."
"There were major shifts in competences."
"We all know about them."
"But the Treaty of Lisbon did not change the heart of the European architecture and this is the Community method."
"We will strictly abide by that."
"Of course, we always have to be in line with the Treaty."
"I would just like to refer to the fact that if you read carefully the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February, you will find there that everything must be in line with the Treaty."
"Now my last remark is very short."
"It is about the money."
"As was pointed out by Lena Ek, policies need money and policies need financing."
"I could not agree more."
"But we know very well that there are divergences in the approaches of the Member States."
"At this point in time I would just like to underline one thing from the point of view of the Presidency: we warmly suggest that first we discuss the substance and thereafter discuss the figures and the monies and the resources."
"There will be a long debate."
"We will have very useful orientation debates on cohesion policy, on energy policy, on agriculture and so on, but, as is said sometimes,"
"(FR) You should not put the cart before the horse."
"So, all in all, we would really like to help all these debates and then come to the real debate, the final debate about the resources."
"Again, I would like to congratulate you all and thank you very much for the guidance we have received."
"I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure on Europe 2020 and one motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure on the employment policies of the Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12:00 tomorrow, Thursday, 17 February."
"(FR) Madam President, the Minister quite rightly referred to respect for the Treaty, and he pointed out that there had been a meeting of the European Council on 4 February."
"Pursuant to Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union, I would like to know when the President of the European Council will come and give an account of the European Council of 4 February to the European Parliament, because I do not believe he is coming to this part-session."
"(FR) We have taken note of your point. Thank you very much."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (RO) I reaffirm the importance of developing as soon as possible all the technical aspects for the 'Youth on the Move' initiative."
"It is crucial that the more than 100 million young people in the European Union have the necessary resources and appropriate tools to enable them to make their contribution to achieving the targets set for 2020."
"I welcome that the lifelong learning scheme and the inclusion of young people in such a scheme are basically coordinated to promote smart, sustainable growth and ensure a healthy life for the adults of the future."
"The provision of high-quality higher education and support for the involvement of young people in research and development activities can ensure the success of the effort to boost economic competitiveness."
"New activities can be developed, bearing in mind the creative potential offered by young people."
"Furthermore, I think that offering employment opportunities, in addition to high-quality training, can provide much greater chances for integration on the labour market."
"Therefore, we need to have the technical details of this initiative as soon as possible to be able to launch the activities required to take full advantage of this year, which is the European Year of Volunteering."
"in writing. - (PL) The quality of human capital is of decisive importance for the success of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The principle of gender mainstreaming is key to the professional education and training system."
"It is an essential requirement if women are to benefit from long-term professional development which is adapted to labour market demands, if better use is to be made of their potential and if employment levels among women are to rise, particularly in traditionally male professions, low carbon sectors of the economy and senior decision-making positions."
"I would call for professional education and training to be adapted to women's needs, and for more women to participate in such education and training."
"At present, it does not take account of the different needs of women and their economic and social conditions."
"This means that women find it much harder than men to return to work or enter the labour market."
"If it is to function effectively, the professional education and training system for women must be comprehensive, or in other words it must encompass experience, life stage and women's multi-dimensional needs as regards education, including the specific needs of disabled women, elderly women, women living in poverty and female immigrants, for example."
"Flexible, affordable access to high-quality training should be a priority."
"A significant role should also be played by incentives for employers, which would facilitate the organisation of training courses for women working in small and medium-sized enterprises and at home."
"In order to achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 Strategy, it will be necessary to link professional training more closely to the demands of the labour market, in order to create new training opportunities for women in the fields of science, mathematics and technology."
"in writing. - The Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth based on five EU headline targets as regards promoting employment."
"A strong social protection system, investment in active labour market policies and education and training opportunities for all are essential to reduce unemployment and prevent long term exclusion."
"The flexicurity is not applicable in Member States with low possibilities of strengthening social protection systems due to budget restrictions and macroeconomic imbalances, as in Romania, and I consider that reducing labour market segmentation has to be achieved by providing adequate security for workers under all forms of contracts."
"Any labour market reforms must be introduced by reaching a high degree of social consensus through agreements with the social partners at national and EU level."
"A legislative agenda is essential to eradicate the existing pay gap between women and men by 1% every year in order to achieve the target of 10% reduction by 2020."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy should include a target of reducing poverty amongst women in the EU as 17 % of the women are classed as living in poverty, mostly single mothers, immigrants and older women."
"in writing. - (RO) The Europe 2020 Strategy must be supported by the 2014-2020 financial framework."
"Transport, energy and communications form the backbone of the European economy."
"Investments in these areas will create jobs and ensure economic and social development."
"The Union's industrial policy is a key element of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"Industrial growth and job creation across the EU will ensure that the European Union is globally competitive."
"In recent decades industrial production has relocated to third countries with low production costs, as a result of European companies being in hot pursuit of profits, and at the cost of job losses in the EU."
"A strong cohesion policy, which is financed appropriately and covers every European region, must be a supplementary key element in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"This horizontal approach is a prerequisite for successfully achieving the targets proposed within the Europe 2020 framework, as well as for achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion."
"One example of this is the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, which will contribute to its prosperity, economic and social development, as well as ensure security in the region."
"Given that European citizens' main concern is still linked to job security, I think that the Europe 2020 Strategy will only succeed if social Europe becomes a reality."
"in writing. - (FR) The Europe 2020 Strategy is ambitious, particularly in the field of employment, and the implementation of the Employment Guidelines is a factor in its achievement."
"Its objectives are fundamental, especially when it comes to enabling us to fund pensions and construct a European social model based on well-being."
"The elements that could constitute the foundations of this social model have been brought into question by Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy's proposals."
"Indeed, the proposals contained in the competitiveness pact include the abolition of the automatic indexing of wages to inflation."
"The argument is that such a move would increase competitiveness and consequently employment."
"There is nothing to show that this will automatically be the case."
"The abolition of automatic indexing could even cause, in certain circumstances, developments which increase inflation, something that nobody wants."
"There are still many other means by which to strive to create employment, such as strategic investment or training in sectors of the future."
"The indexing of pay and social benefits is an instrument which some countries have embraced in order to reduce the risk of poverty among workers, which is a growing phenomenon in Europe."
"This provides an opportunity, therefore, to meet another objective of the Union for 2020: 20 million fewer poor."
"The Europe 2020 Strategy is revealing its true agenda."
"The last European Council confirmed it."
"It is driven by greater liberalisation; moving the market into new areas; labour market flexibility; and unrivalled attacks on wages and social rights."
"The instruments for implementing this agenda have been set out: so-called 'economic governance' and the recent Franco-German 'competitiveness pact'."
"In practice, they want what the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are applying in various Member States under the umbrella of the 'assistance plans', as they are perversely known, with catastrophic consequences in economic and social terms, to be more widespread and imposed as a rule."
"The implementation of the proposed measures conceals the real causes of the difficult economic and social situation in countries like Portugal."
"Worse still, it would have particularly serious consequences for these countries and for the living conditions of their citizens."
"We are facing an extremely serious threat to the rights of European workers and citizens, which is bordering on a revanchist crusade against employment and social rights."
"It seeks to degrade these rights by attacking wages, raising the retirement age and removing restrictions on the free movement of workers within the EU."
"This could lead to the devaluation of the EU labour force and even greater flexibility in terms of employment laws."
"One year has passed since the new Europe 2020 Strategy was adopted, and the time has come to draw the first conclusions."
"The strategy was greeted with some scepticism, which was reasonable considering the complete failure of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Many commentators forecast that it too would remain nothing more than an empty document, full of goals that were as noble as they were unrealistic."
"There can be no one among us who has forgotten the fundamental goal of the Lisbon Strategy, namely that by 2010 the Union would become the most competitive economy in the world."
"Where are we now?"
"The great economic crisis and budgetary crises in the euro area have forced the Union to fight for survival, rather than for a position as a global economic leader."
"Is the Europe 2020 Strategy also doomed to failure?"
"There is good reason to believe so."
"Instead of thinking about how to create a knowledge- and innovation-based economy, or how to reduce social exclusion, we are discussing the extent to which funding will be limited in the Community budget."
"It is becoming increasingly evident that there is a lack of political will actually to address the strategy proposed by the Commission."
"It seems that once again the problem of a long-term vision for the Union's development has been obscured by current problems."
"In order to enable the Community to retain its place in the global economy, to compete not only with the US and China, but also Brazil and India, it has to set long-term goals for itself and work towards them consistently."
"We already have a plan; now we just need to ensure that it is implemented consistently."
"in writing. - (HU) The Europe 2020 Strategy not only pointed beyond the Lisbon Strategy at the time of its formulation, but had to be expressly adjusted to the new period of crisis; what is more, it now also has to reflect upon the period of economic governance and the rescue of the euro."
"The new Member States must also make sure that they maintain sufficient freedom of movement and competitiveness in order to resolve the deepening structural and employment problems they have retained after the Eastern European changes of regime."
"Wrong decisions and serious governmental negligence in the past also require us to pay attention to the situation of families: the labour market does not only consist of employers and employees, but also of multi-generation families maintaining more or less close relations."
"These not only represent the foundation of society but also the key to its future."
"Closer cooperation between generations could in itself give a considerable boost to employment (e.g. employment of young mothers, support to people with disabilities in finding work, maintaining the activity of the elderly, even in the civil sector), and common planning (e.g. housing situation) could also help avoid individual and family debt crises and bankruptcies, which are sufficient to force families into the grey economy due to high repayment instalments."
"This previous way is no longer feasible."
"New approaches will also be required, as the old formulas are no longer sufficient, and the European Union, too, must come to realise this."
"The EU must also support solutions which may seem unconventional at the moment."
"in writing. - The Europe 2020 Strategy is one of the most important projects we've created, yet, there is no guarantee of its success."
"We should include gender equality in all targets, flagship initiatives and national reforms - and women should be considered in all policy areas."
"The open method of coordination is a weak means to carry out common goals, therefore results will only come if there is real commitment!"
"The Europe 2020 Strategy's employment targets call for an increase in women's employment."
"This, the reconciliation of work and family life and the elimination of gender stereotypes in the labour market are a must."
"We need to involve more women in vocational training, the sciences and educational fields that have been until now considered as 'masculine'."
"We have to end the gender-based segregation of the labour market, especially when it comes to the new green jobs."
"Fully including women to the labour market is a way to put an end to the demographic crisis."
"If we provide secure and decent work, the means to reconcile work and family life and if we manage to include men more intensively in household duties, then all studies show that women would be more willing to bear children."
"in writing. - The Euro 2020 Strategy is about economic growth and employment."
"We must remember that a smart energy system is the future both in terms of the environment and these jobs."
"Such a system would allow us to decouple economic growth from energy consumption."
"If this will be the case, we will be able to produce more for the same or less energy consumption and create thousands of jobs which can not be outsourced."
"We have to make sure that smart energy does not remain a dream."
"We are building today a whole new energy infrastructure in Europe."
"We have to ensure this lessens the divide between Western and Central Europe in terms of sustainable jobs."
"A two-speed Europe on energy will not solve energy poverty or inefficiency."
"We should give a helping hand to those regions which are behind, even if it is not easy in today's economic realities."
"We need a smart energy system for all European citizens at the same time."
"We must prevent a piecemeal system where some citizens only see the future 50 years after the others."
"Simply put, we need smart energy jobs for all Europeans, not just for those who would have received them even without Europe."
"in writing. - Straight away after the entry of Latvia to the EU, the Latvian government decided that for the allocation of resources from EU funds it was enough to declare Latvia to be one region."
"(Poland is divided into 16 regions)."
"As a result, one of the 4 regions of Latvia - Latgale - remains one of the most unprotected."
"Application of funds in Latgale is many times less efficient than in Latvia as a whole."
"This situation is reflected on the labour market of Latgale."
"While the unemployment rate in the capital city of Latvia (Riga) is 8-9%, in Latgale it is 20-25%."
"European employment programs are inaccessible to the population of such towns as Livani, Preili, Kraslava, Ludza, Aglona and Dagda."
"Instead of solving the issue of organisation and stimulation of production in Latgale, the Latvian government is continuously increasing taxes, which leads to widespread bankruptcy of small and medium-sized companies."
"To avoid social tension the inhabitants of Latgale are given LVL 100 per month as a sop."
"The common policy of the Latvian government has resulted in the emigration of more than 150 000 workers."
"I appeal to the European Commission for urgent intervention in the situation."
"It is necessary to work out an Employment Framework for outlying regions of the EU such as Latgale."

"Mr President, in relation to the next two amendments, I am withdrawing our Amendment No 8."
"In return, as discussed with Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, and his shadows, we have an oral amendment to Amendment 7 which reads, 'in order to address remaining shortcomings with regard to the domestic prosecution of war crimes ... ' the text would then continue with that in Amendment 7 by Mr Swoboda."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the report by Marisa Matias, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source - C6-0513/2008 -."
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Mr President, I support the compromise reached on the proposal for a directive because, despite some sticking points, I think it is a good text which protects patients from the great dangers arising from taking falsified medicinal products."
"Over the years we have seen a huge increase in the number of these products, and the most recent estimates indicate that about one and a half million medicines are sold illegally in Europe, particularly via the Internet."
"These data constitute a serious threat not only to patients but also to European producers."
"At stake here are the protection of public health and the safeguarding of consumers, who must be given an assurance that strict safety measures and effective sanctions will be employed by Member States."
"With today's vote, effective and flexible rules will be introduced, and we will also fight against organised crime."
"To understand the safety requirement affecting the sector, one need only think that, in 2008, approximately 34 million illegal medicines were seized."
"We could perhaps have been a little bolder with regard to the traceability of medicines and active ingredients from third countries."
"Nevertheless, the step we have taken today is still important."
"(IT) Mr President, the Commission proposal on preventing the entry of falsified medicines into the supply chain highlights a concern that is becoming a priority for all Europeans: the quality and safety of the medicines we use every day."
"It is therefore necessary to introduce a new European strategy to combat the rampant phenomenon of the spread of falsified medicines, with the dual purpose of being able to respond to this growing threat to public health and of being able to ensure the safety of all patients."
"The latest reports on the subject have indeed recorded a truly sharp increase in seizures of falsified medicines by customs, as well as a growing, and therefore extremely dangerous, trend for falsifying not only 'lifestyle' medicines but also life-saving medicines, including medicines to treat cancer, heart disease, psychiatric disorders and infections."
"(IT) Mr President, the number of falsified medicines seized along the border of the European Union in 2007 was 384% higher than in 2005."
"We also saw an increase in the trend for falsifying even life-saving medicines, including medicines to treat cancer and heart disease, psychiatric disorders and infections."
"These figures reflect an alarming scenario, in which patients are likely to encounter situations such as treatment failure, thus endangering their health and, in some cases, their lives."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal."
"Mrs Matias's report rightly points out, however, the negative aspects and points on which we are bound to reassure our citizens."
"In particular, I would stress that the Commission's proposal fails to provide exhaustive answers concerning the nature and characteristics of a falsified medicinal product, active ingredient or excipient, or any definitions of the various parties involved in the supply chain, whose roles and responsibilities should be clarified."
"The sanctions in the Commission proposal are inadequate, but above all the proposal takes no account of the sale of medicines on the Internet, one of the main channels through which falsified medicines enter the European market."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the report by Mrs Matias since the entry of falsified medicinal products into the legal supply chain poses a threat to the entire European pharmaceutical system, as it undermines the confidence citizens have in the quality of medicines sold in pharmacies and other places of legal distribution."
"It is important to curb the steadily growing phenomenon of falsified medicines in all European countries in order to protect and ensure the health of our citizens."
"The active ingredients contained in a falsified medicine may in fact be sub-standard, completely absent, or present in an incorrect dose."
"(IT) Mr President, the official figures say it all: 1% of the medicines sold legally in the European Union are falsified."
"What is more, the latest surveys show that the phenomenon is steadily growing and that its proportions have now exceeded the warning stage."
"As Mr Antoniozzi has already emphasised, the falsification of life-saving medicines is particularly profitable when those medicines are produced in India or China and then passed off as European products."
"These substances pose an unprecedented risk, and they could threaten the lives of those who use them for therapeutic purposes."
"I voted for the report to say No to cowboy sales via the Internet, the preferred channel for placing these poisons on to the European Union pharmaceutical market."
"With the adoption of this document, Parliament will finally be able to make its voice heard, acquiring the means necessary to find and punish these people who are no better than drug dealers, unscrupulous criminals who have been getting rich for too long at the expense of sick people."
"(IT) Mr President, the problem of falsified medicinal products is one that is having an ever greater impact at international and EU level, in terms of the increased number of cases as well as the advances in the development of these products."
"These are the challenges to which Mrs Matias's report - the outcome of long and painstaking negotiations - sets out to respond."
"The report, for which we expressed our support, has established a regulatory framework which, taking as its basis more precise and detailed definitions, took into account all the actors, stages and aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain - safety, traceability and obligations of the distribution chain - in order to achieve a good compromise."
"These are some of the issues on which we must try to work in order to achieve the main goal of establishing more stringent standards and to prevent the entry of falsified medicinal products, thus achieving a positive and more comprehensive regulatory framework that safeguards the health of citizens, protecting them from the risk of serious consequences."
"(SK) Mr President, according to estimates, about 1% of the overall volume of medicines supplied to patients legally through the pharmacy network in the EU today are fake."
"That percentage is constantly rising."
"This is about people's health."
"Fake medicines may have effects other than those of the tablets prescribed by the doctor."
"They may also be a risk to health."
"Counterfeiting is a crime and must carry specific penalties."
"The new legislation, which I support, introduces more safety elements, as well as penalties for counterfeiters."
"It defines a monitoring system improving the identification of medicines, so that in future the flow of medicines can be traced all the way from the producer to the consumer."
"The sale of medicines via the Internet is also included within the framework of the new rules."
"This represents one of the most common ways for fake products to get onto EU markets."
"(HU) Mr President, I too gladly supported this report, because, as my fellow Members have mentioned several times, WHO estimates indicate that falsified medicinal products are circulated in large quantities in EU Member States."
"Their number is continuously increasing, and we must therefore do everything in our power to prevent falsified medicines from entering the supply chain."
"Even though this does not threaten the entire pharmaceutical industry, it still undermines people's confidence in pharmacies, not to mention the fact that falsified medicinal products may contain sub-standard active ingredients."
"Estimates indicate that the number of boxes of falsified medicines could reach 42 million by 2020, exposing the European economy to significant risk."
"The European pharmaceutical sector realises a total annual turnover of more than EUR 170 billion."
"We must prevent unfair competition from foreign producers that place medicinal products on the market, the manufacturing process of which cannot be checked."
"Furthermore, I believe it is important that we discuss matters such as the sale of medicinal products over the Internet."
"Through virtual pharmacies, products which are clearly subject to medical prescription are available over the worldwide web."
"Not to mention that this is the easiest way for counterfeiters to introduce their products into the supply chain."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution on the progress of Croatia's accession to the European Union within the framework of the enlargement process, because I attach great importance to starting this process and to the progress made by Croatia."
"In essence, we hope that the enlargement will extend beyond Croatia and end up encompassing the whole of the Western Balkans."
"This is one of the key points of Europe's neighbourhood and enlargement policies."
"My vote is therefore, without doubt, in favour of the Swoboda report."
"(FR) Mr President, we have been obliged to adopt a report today on the protection of patients from falsified medicines, partly because the market liberalism advocated by the European Commission has opened the door to the market in falsified products."
"Deregulated competition leads to medicines being falsified for the benefit of companies."
"The victims are consumers."
"I voted for this report even though I am not entirely convinced that the definition of a falsified product is correct."
"Furthermore, it is not entirely clear who should be punished when a falsified medicine is found."
"However, it is an initial step in the right direction, and we shall see in a year's time if our action was effective."
"(IT) Mr President, the resolution adopted today has established important principles for the protection of consumers, increasing safeguards against the spread of falsified medicinal products."
"This is an extremely dangerous phenomenon, and one of the most significant remedies has been to stem the online sale of medicines of dubious origin."
"Moreover, through the adoption of a number of guarantees, we will establish strict regulations that require permits and inspections."
"This does not, however, mean that forms of health protection and medical prescriptions are cancelled out."
"It must be remembered that the legislative power of Member States is unaffected in this respect and that they may retain or limit the ban on the online sales of drugs within their territory."
"This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry."
"Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this."
"- (SK) Mr President, we are debating a law on counterfeit medicines."
"We know that, after weapons and drugs, the pharmaceutical industry makes the largest profits, and it is no accident therefore that criminals are focusing on counterfeit medicines, in order to deceive those of our fellow citizens who are patients."
"Frequently a medicine that is supposed to treat cancer or the heart does not contain any of the effective ingredient, or only a small percentage of it, and this crime puts at risk the health and often even the life of the patient."
"It is good that we have also adopted principles in this text, new principles, which tighten up the penalties for those who engage in criminal activity in this area, and I am pleased that Europe has taken a step in the right direction."
"Sales on the Internet will be better monitored, of course, as well as sales through the standard supply system, which often sells fake medicines."
"(IT) Mr President, in recent years the number of falsified medicinal products has increased exponentially, and it is regrettable that, despite a 384% increase in the sale of these products between 2005 and 2007, the Commission has been so late in taking action."
"We are absolutely convinced by the stance taken by the rapporteur, who has sought to improve the Commission's text by also considering the sale of medicines via the Internet."
"In recent years I have repeatedly questioned the Commission on this topic and highlighted the dangers involved, but no answers have ever been given or any concrete action taken."
"Today we therefore welcome the rapporteur's efforts to improve the text, and hope that from now on Europeans' health will actually be a matter of primary concern to our institutions."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the report by Mrs Matias, as it is vitally important to increase safety standards and establish effective, efficient and tough rules to prevent falsified medicinal products from entering the European Union."
"This is a requirement and a duty that we must fulfil on behalf of all European citizens, who are often unaware that they are buying a falsified medicine."
"I agree with the thrust of the report, which introduces obligations to be met not only by distributors but also by all those involved in the supply chain."
"Indeed, it is often in the intricacies of the various steps in the distribution chain that high-risk products are introduced."
"Monitoring must not, however, only be carried out when products are placed on the market."
"Rather, inspections should take place at the sites where medicinal products and active ingredients are produced, including in third countries."
"I do have one concern, however, which I must voice: I would have preferred the regulation to have regulated matters more effectively, by harmonising the various national laws, including online sales, in order to fully protect European consumers."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for this report because the regulatory framework that emerges from it is much better than the one laid down by the 2001 Directive."
"The latter placed the sole responsibility for compliance with wholesale distributors, thus failing to guarantee the reliability of the pharmaceutical supply chain in any way."
"The report we voted on today introduced measures to further ensure the safety of pharmaceutical products such as, for example, the stepping up of inspections of manufacturers outside the European Union on the basis of a risk analysis."
"The proposed amendment also includes the need to publish in an EU database a list of certified wholesale distributors, in other words distributors for which compliance with EU legislation has not been established through inspection by the Member State alone."
"We could nevertheless have hoped for a more ambitious outcome."
"I refer particularly to the introduction of mandatory inspections of active-ingredient production sites in third countries."
"These were omitted on the grounds that implementation costs would have been too high."
"If they had been introduced, we could have avoided the oft repeated situation of European companies having to meet very high quality standards, while companies that produce in other parts of the world benefit from regulatory frameworks that are undoubtedly less stringent."
"I therefore hope that improvements can be made in the future."
"(IT) Mr President, more than 100 million workers depend directly or indirectly on small and medium-sized enterprises today in Europe."
"Yet small and medium-sized enterprises are experiencing an unprecedented crisis: lack of liquidity, bureaucratic obstacles and constraints and administrative barriers."
"Herein lies the crux of this motion for a resolution: Parliament is calling for credit and loan guarantee programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises and a vigorous European drive that is more than just a pipe dream to combat the new - and for many prohibitive - business-banking requirements, particularly with regard to higher collateral guarantees and risk premiums."
"Lastly, I agree with the need to significantly increase funding within the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, and to revive the issue of simplification with strength and determination: streamline and simplify, so that firms wishing to access funds are able do so without having to resort to very expensive outside consultants."
"These are the reasons why I voted for this resolution: the SMEs and the 100 million European workers employed in the sector expect it of us."
"(SK) Mr President, of all the practical aspects relating to the revision of EU instruments supporting the funding of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), I would like to highlight in particular the problems of external funding."
"It is clear that a large number of SMEs will continue to depend mainly on credit and loans."
"It is disturbing that the banking sector is demanding ever greater securities and higher risk premiums, which reduces the chances of funding and of these businesses making use of entrepreneurial and job opportunities."
"I therefore consider it necessary to strengthen individual programmes at the Member State level, and also to boost the resources of the EU and the European Investment Bank focused on innovative financial instruments."
"It is necessary to support the further implementation of guarantee instruments in connection with revolving loans - and I would emphasise this - and the exploitation of financial instruments involving risk spreading, as well as the expansion of microfinancing institutions."
"(PL) Mr President, this is an important motion for a resolution on the mechanism of financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Occasionally, we face criticism that on one hand we talk about the important role of this business sector - in manufacturing, in the creation of one third of the GDP in the European Union and in the creation of secure jobs - but without good instruments providing financial support to these companies."
"Most of the EU funds for development and innovation go primarily to large companies due to their requirements."
"This should be changed, since small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to meet the demands made of them."
"The crisis has severely limited small and medium-sized enterprises' access to credit and loans, and new regulations that are targeted at the banking sector may make matters even worse."
"Let me mention here the Basel III package, which has already been approved, with regard to its precautionary standards."
"I believe that access to funding for business development, particularly in the field of innovation, is especially important."
"We emphasise the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly as a group of 'sleeping innovators'."
"These small and medium-sized enterprises need to enter the European market on a wider scale."
"This will help to revive the economy, create jobs and achieve the objectives established in the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"(IT) Mr President, it is necessary to evaluate and review existing instruments to support the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises in view of the next multiannual financial framework if we wish to focus on promoting the recovery of the real economy in this and other sectors in order to overcome the crisis once and for all."
"This need is also imposed by the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises' interests if - as Basel III proposes - higher equity capital requirements are established for banks."
"It is also required by the situation of many financial intermediaries, who are deterred by the administrative burdens created by complex European financial regulations, and it is influenced by the difficulties created by different tax and support systems."
"It is prompted by a requirement to make European Union support programmes consistent in order to provide better guarantees and a good balance between national and EU schemes."
"I therefore support the proposal to establish a one-stop shop for the various EU financing instruments aimed at SMEs."
"Simplifying bidding and procedures for access to markets is an important means of support even if it proves necessary to increase funding."
"Massive sums have been spent to save careless banks: I feel that spending on 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises can only be an asset."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for the motion for a resolution because I believe that we need a European strategy for SMEs which, as we all know, are the backbone of our economy and need support and help."
"The next European Union financial programming cannot therefore ignore these considerations and must increase and diversify the resources available."
"However, this is only one measure and inadequate at that: more are needed."
"It is important to act with the aid of a long-term strategy to avoid stopgap or one-off measures - I refer to the new financial rules that the EU is preparing to implement."
"We need to ensure that these new regulations do not make it tougher to lend to businesses - I am also referring to Basel III."
"This is the real new challenge: to reconcile and regulate the banking system while preventing costs from being passed on to companies, citizens and SMEs."
"We need growth to help rehabilitate and support the sector, putting our ideas into practice."
"Mr President, I am happy to support this resolution, but of course one of the main problems faced by SMEs is access to credit."
"This is a major impediment to job creation and indeed growth."
"In countries undergoing severe austerity measures - like my own country, Ireland - this issue is particularly severe and I believe it needs to be dealt with immediately."
"We need to act at EU level to ensure that banks are willing and able to finance SMEs."
"Recapitalisation of banks is important, but recapitalised banks with the SME sector on its knees is a recipe for disaster."
"My real fear is that we are going to end up with a highly capitalised banking system, while the real economy is on floor."
"We all talk about growth, and that is the only way that many of the peripheral economies can climb out of the abyss that they are already in."
"Yes, it is a balancing act, but we have a situation where the health of our financial institutions is improving day by day but SMEs still remain in intensive care."
"(IT) Mr President, demographic trends recorded in recent years lead us to consider the need to implement a strategy for fresh cohesion and coherence in the pensions field, to promote solidarity between generations and between people, while helping to ensure a safe and adequate income after retirement."
"I agree with the rapporteur when she notes that there are major differences between pension systems in Europe."
"They have been greatly affected by the severe financial and economic crisis with rising unemployment, declining growth, lower investment returns and growth in public debt."
"Pension funds find it more difficult to ensure adequate pensions and, in some cases, to honour their commitments."
"During the reform of their pension systems, many Member States have made swingeing cuts."
"Financial sustainability is important, but we should also take into account the need to ensure an adequate income."
"Budget sustainability and adequacy of pension systems are not conflicting goals but two sides of the same coin: true sustainability cannot be achieved without an adequate retirement income."
"By virtue of my experience as Minister for Employment in Italy, Mr President, I can confirm that if there is no compliance by the Member States, it will be very difficult for individual States to adapt to this type of legislation."
"(DA) Mr President, not so long ago, the European Court of Justice ruled that Germany must have greater transparency with regard to its occupational pensions and that it must put these pensions out to public tender."
"I had great expectations that this would be a ruling that would have a knock-on effect on other countries in Europe."
"This, unfortunately, did not happen, and the Commission has not been willing to put pressure on other countries that tie their people to certain pensions."
"Therefore, it is also important that the European Parliament has now determined that pension systems shall have an earning capacity for citizens."
"There is to be transparency with regard to costs and returns and we must remove the barriers to mobility across borders."
"All of these are good and sound liberal principles, but if we take this to its logical conclusion, people should also be able to move their pensions from one fund to another if the unemployment or pension fund that they have been assigned to by their trade union or employer does not do its job properly."
"We did not achieve that much this time round, but we have nevertheless taken a step in the right direction today, and I think this is good for the internal market and for citizens' chances of getting a decent return on their pensions."
"(IT) Mr President, given the pressure it exerts on budgets, efficiency in social spending currently plays a key role in the economic systems of Member States."
"This has been illustrated in recent years, when we have seen a rise in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, resulting in worsening budget deficits in many Member States, followed by pension funding problems."
"I welcome the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, which aims to provide new impetus at national and European Union level, helping to create solid pension systems that are adequate in the long term, sustainable and safe."
"However, I take this opportunity to recall that we still lack a common set of criteria, definitions and an in-depth analysis which would thoroughly explain the various pension systems and their capacity to meet the needs of citizens."
"I wonder how we can tackle such a sensitive issue in the absence of such a study."
"I therefore call on the Commission to remedy this shortcoming by taking appropriate action to come up with a typology of pension systems in Member States as well as with a common set of definitions in order to make systems comparable."
"(NL) Mr President, I would just like to make a suggestion."
"I notice that an awful lot of speakers have run way over their allotted speaking time, sometimes by as much as 30 seconds."
"I would ask you to be stricter about ensuring adherence to the set speaking time."
"You can, of course, be strict with me in this respect, as well."
"Having concluded the vote so quickly, I thought I would be more flexible with fellow Members who have run over their allotted time."
"If you ask me to be strict, I will be strict, but always in moderation of course."
"(IT) Mr President, I, on the contrary, appreciate your generosity, because during the discussions we never have an opportunity to go over one minute and this is therefore another chance to speak and debate, on the explanations of vote in this case, which after all go to the root of the reports that we vote on."
"European pension systems are in an increasingly alarming state."
"We must act now to ensure that men and women have equal opportunities, protecting those who decide to retire today and, at the same time, protecting those who are only now taking their first steps in the labour market."
"In Europe, women still earn on average 18% less than men."
"The main effect of this wage disparity is apparent at retirement age: because they have earned less throughout their working lives, women also have lower pensions."
"As a result, women are more affected than men by persistent poverty."
"Especially in times of crisis, we need to include a gender perspective in all policies, adopting national measures that are agreed on and coordinated at European level."
"(PL) Mr President, the purpose of the Green Paper is to gather the views of the Member States on how to achieve the intended goal of adequate, stable and secure pensions, given that the report adopted by the Commission rightly concludes firstly that there is no reason to harmonise pension systems, and secondly that Member States should provide various forms for the development of future pensions, and above all that they should recognise a minimum pension in order to protect people from poverty."
"Thirdly, Member States such as Poland which implemented a difficult pension reform, resulting in a deficit increase and public debt, should not be penalised by the excessive deficit procedure."
"Fourthly, the pension system should encourage longer working lives, which is consistent with the trend in the labour market."
"In my opinion, the conclusions are fully in line with the EU's Europe 2020 economic strategy, and in particular with the employment strategy and the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for this resolution because I believe that the compromise reached with such difficulty within our committee is essentially positive, insofar as it is a tool to remind Member States to ensure that pensions are adequate, sustainable and portable throughout Europe, in the context of a significantly ageing population."
"I would however like to make three criticisms, which I hope the European Commission will implement in the coming White Paper."
"The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems."
"Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age."
"This would, however, be desirable."
"Thirdly, European citizens' right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives."
"(FI) Mr President, it is very important at European level to try to move towards adequate, sustainable and safe pension systems."
"We obviously have to remember that there are 27 different Member States in the EU."
"Their economic circumstances still vary in many respects, and pensions differ greatly in terms of size."
"We basically have to ensure, however, that pension income is adequate in the different Member States."
"I am mainly concerned about the pensions of those young people who work in the different countries, the different Member States of the European Union."
"How can we make sure that pensions can be transferred more satisfactorily from one country to another, and not just from pension fund to pension fund, as there are big problems with those too?"
"I would hope for flexibility in this."
"In this we perhaps need Europeanwide coordination."
"I know that the pensions debate will continue, as recently I read that in 2010, for example, the life expectancy of children born in Finland is 100 years."
"If we consider that 30 years are spent studying and 30 years are spent at work, then they will be on a pension for 40 years."
"We will therefore definitely have to think about systems in a new way, so that this situation can be dealt with in a manner that is sustainable for everyone."
"- (SK) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report, even though the Green Paper drawn up by the European Commission has its shortcomings."
"The 2020 Strategy presents a dream future to us."
"The Green Paper launches a discussion on the actual future, but ignores reality."
"One motif runs through the entire Green Paper: let old people work."
"The authors of the Green Paper do not even try to look for a solution at the point where life begins."
"They use the word 'woman' only six times."
"They use the word 'family' three times and 'child' only once."
"I therefore think that the Commission should draw up its White Paper in a substantially more comprehensive way, emphasise the importance of motherhood and the informal work of women, listen to the Confederation of Families from all over Europe and incorporate a new imperative into all of its policies and strategies: family mainstreaming."
"- (SK) Mr President, the differences between the various Member State pension systems are enormous, which results from the fact that this area belongs within, and should continue to belong within, the direct powers of the Member States."
"Of course, a certain consultancy is essential, in my opinion, because the European Union and the Member States must look for a solution immediately to economic and demographic challenges such as, for example, forecasts that the ratio of inhabitants over 65 to the population of productive age will rise to 53% in 2060."
"At the same time, there are only two workers to every pensioner."
"In this context it is natural that average public expenditure on pensions and expenditure related to ageing will increase, and it will become ever more difficult to provide adequate pensions."
"It is therefore necessary to encourage people to enter the labour market, increasing employment levels and economic growth."
"The importance of the family is also not sufficiently emphasised, as my colleague Mrs Záborská has said."
"Nobody talks about the need to have children to improve our pension system."
"(BG) I voted for this report, because I believe that the development of adequate and sustainable European pension systems is very important, especially when you consider the demographic processes which Europe is undergoing and that we have a continent, which continues to an increasingly ageing population and an increasing number of people will have to be supported on less and less."
"I would also like to say that the changes, which I also support, and which involve the Commission setting up groups of experts to draft projects with which to help the national systems, should not extend their authority too much."
"Pension policy is a policy of the Member States and the Commission must not exceed its authority, even though its advice will be useful in all cases."
"(PL) Mr President, we have adopted an extremely important report on pension systems in Europe."
"We are in fact facing serious demographic challenges."
"The birth rate is very low, life expectancy is increasing, and public spending is growing due to ageing societies."
"Debates on raising the retirement age are being held in many countries."
"The current economic and demographic situation forces us to give serious thought to this issue."
"As I said, life expectancy is increasing."
"We are working under better conditions, which allows us to work for longer."
"Pension systems fall under the competence of the Member States."
"However, the time has come for them to be coordinated at EU level, for example in relation to the functioning of the internal market and the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Expenditure on pensions and medical treatment significantly affects the state of public finances in the individual Member States."
"We need to encourage people to extend their careers by means of improved working conditions and higher wages."
"Mr President, I welcome this report."
"Hopefully it will put the issue of pensions centre stage in EU matters."
"I think the core issue is: how are Member States going to finance adequate pensions for their citizens?"
"What systems will they put in place using some combination of the three pillars to ensure that their pension systems are sustainable?"
"There is a yawning gap between current pension provision and what will be needed to provide pensions at current levels for the next 40 years."
"Indeed, an estimate from a major insurance company states that the gap between what we are currently providing, both public and private, and what will be needed to ensure that pension provision remains at the same level in 40 years' time for the EU 27, is EUR 1.9 trillion per year."
"That is a staggering figure and, while measures such as, perhaps, longer working lives or other initiatives will help to bridge that gap, there is still an enormous fiscal black hole."
"I hope that this debate and the subsequent White Paper from the Commission will ensure that we begin to deal with this matter in a realistic way."
"(GA) Mr President, I was pleased to vote for this report, because I feel that it is more than time for us to discuss this issue in Parliament."
"Without a doubt the pensions problem at this point is a 'bomb ready to explode', and it will be worse in the future."
"But certain practices must be eliminated; for example, in my own country, there will be politicians resigning now who will receive more on pension than if they continued working."
"There is no sense whatever in that."
"In addition, there are people on pension who are getting more on pension than they were getting twenty years ago when they had young children and a large mortgage."
"These issues must be discussed, and in particular a huge reserve must be established to provide pensions in the future."
"Mr President, we now see what is meant by European economic governance, by fiscal federalism."
"Whatever else we say about the leaders of the EU, no-one can fault their lack of ambition."
"We see here their sheer hunger for power."
"Awesome."
"Inexorable."
"Rude and incontinent."
"Not only are we talking about tax harmonisation, about a European debt union, about automatic fiscal transfers, but we are also talking about the harmonisation of pensions."
"We are talking about the harmonisation of public sector salaries."
"We are talking about the full machinery of single EU economic governance."
"I am sure you can spot the logical flaw here."
"This is being done as a result of the failure of monetary union."
"European monetary union has not worked, so let us have European economic and fiscal union."
"Closer integration has failed to deliver, so let us have more integration."
"In the process, what we are doing is condemning the peoples of several of the Member States to preventable poverty and preventable emigration, in order to sustain our own conceit."
"Mr President, it is quite clear that across the political spectrum we all want adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems."
"If we confined ourselves to the idea of making sure that a worker in one State can move to another Member State and take their pension with them, that might be a valid idea to pursue."
"We should, however, be careful about the different structures of pension systems in different Member States."
"Some are more private-oriented and some are very much State-funded."
"As we move towards more harmonised European pension systems, the concern I hear from my constituents is whether they will have to bail out underfunded or badly managed State pension funds in other countries, just as we have had to bail out badly managed countries and their national debt."
"We talk about sustainable pensions, yet at the same time we bring about policies in this place such as the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, which will reduce the returns on savings and investments for tomorrow's pensioners."
"We must make sure we have a consistent message."
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report and would like to emphasise two points."
"Firstly, when we see that in some countries in Europe too many pensions are being paid out too early, but these countries are getting into difficulties and the others are having to bail them out, that is unfair."
"This unfairness cannot, of course, be refinanced via the EU."
"We need European coordination in this regard."
"The second point that I am very pleased with in this report is the fact that it makes it very clear, according to the principle of subsidiarity, that the Member States themselves are responsible for pension provision."
"That is indeed the case."
"I therefore consider this report to be a step in the right direction in that, on the one hand, we in Europe are recognising that our citizens want more coordination in the social sphere because they feel unfairly treated and, on the other, we are making it clear where the main responsibility lies, namely with the Member States."
"This report represents a step in this direction."
"We will do everything possible to ensure that the White Paper continues to push ahead with this."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this proposal, though I want to remind everyone that pension policy, like social policy, is a national matter and the power of decision must also remain national."
"Nevertheless, European cooperation is needed in cases where people who have been working in other EU countries and who then possibly return to their country of origin receive their pension from those countries where they have been working."
"Today that is difficult and there are flaws in the system."
"This is something that the Member States of the European Union should put right."
"If there is free movement of labour, pensions must also always move from one country to another."
"(ET) I am very glad that we have dealt with this report and that we are adopting it today."
"I voted for it as well."
"I am glad that this report does not infringe on Member States, but that it takes into account the principle of subsidiarity: it provides guidelines rather than mandatory rules."
"It is clear that the aim of the report is to give a new momentum to the consolidation of the pension system while keeping its sustainability in mind."
"The report provides Member States with new ideas for dealing with their own pension systems in order to make them more satisfactory."
"Several points in the report have been tackled positively, including mobility and transferability, retirement age, the framework for pension systems, and their relevance to the 2020 Strategy."
"Another positive point is that the report stipulates the reviewal of European Union legislation."
"I also supported the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisory Office, because the economic crisis has shown us that there is a need for an institution such as this."
"(IT) Mr President, I visited Croatia several times in the early 1990s, during the war, precisely in order to take humanitarian aid, and this is one of the reasons why I care about Croatia's entry into the European Union."
"Croatia has done a lot: it has reformed the judiciary and public administration, it has combated corruption and organised crime, and it has protected minority rights."
"I am convinced that Croatia's accession will encourage the other Western Balkan countries to launch and implement new democratic and transparent reforms, and also an excellent neighbourhood policy."
"However, there is still much to do in memory of the extensive ethnic cleansing campaign conducted against the Italian population between 1945 and 1948 by the militias of the Croatian authorities of the former Yugoslav communist regime."
"During that campaign, more than 20 000 innocent victims were slaughtered."
"On 10 February, the Day of Remembrance, Italy commemorates the Foibe Massacres and the Istrian and Dalmatian exiles in order not only to remember those who were brutally killed, but also to reaffirm the rights of those exiled, starting with rights to property confiscated during those years, and the right of repatriation."
"(RO) Mr President, I would like to return here to points I raised in some of the amendments tabled along with Bernd Posselt, which successfully passed through the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"First of all, I would like to repeat the hope that the accession negotiations with Croatia will be concluded in the first half of 2011, as announced in the Hungarian Presidency's programme."
"From this perspective, it would be a symbolic act because it would take place 20 years after the declaration of independence from the former Yugoslav Republic."
"On the other hand, concluding the negotiations in this manner would send out a very strong signal to the other candidate countries in the Balkans at a time when, as we are aware, the Union's power of attraction seems to be waning."
"Finally, I would like to highlight the Croatian authorities' determination to combat corruption and organised crime."
"This is an indication, as we have noticed on other occasions too, that corruption is not fatal if political will exists."
"(NL) Mr President, I have voted against this report, despite the fact that I am in favour of Croatia joining the European Union."
"My problem with this report is that, even though it reads like one long list of the current corruption problems in Croatia, we still seem to be insisting that the negotiations be concluded in the next few months."
"We should actually be learning from our past mistakes."
"In 2007, we admitted Romania and Bulgaria, even though we knew that they had not met the conditions and that corruption was a major problem."
"Knowing, as we do, that there are still so many major problems, I think that it is totally inappropriate and unacceptable that we should now be pinned down to a specific date."
"(PL) Mr President, unlike Mr Claeys I gladly voted in favour of this report on enlargement and the conclusion of negotiations with Croatia."
"This is a key objective of the Hungarian Presidency, which will also be a great success for Croatia and send out an important message to the other countries in the region hoping to join the European Union."
"The few chapters that are left until negotiations can be concluded should be closed before the middle of the year."
"The most important factor here is the political will demonstrated by Croatia, which has declared its determination to implement all the provisions and criteria for membership."
"This political will also relates to the resolution of difficult relations with its neighbours."
"All of the countries that have recently become EU members know that final negotiations are the toughest, because they include many provisions that apply to large social groups."
"The example of the shipyards in Croatia is also a good example of this."
"I wish Croatia much determination, and I would be very glad if the Treaty of Accession could be signed during the Polish Presidency."
"(FR) Mr President, Croatia is one of those states which should have joined the European Union a long time ago."
"I voted for this report and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Füle for having voiced the central concern of European integration policy: reciprocal loyalty."
"Nevertheless, I regret that the section on freedom of religion was not examined in sufficient depth."
"Croatia's accession to the European Union does not signify the abandonment of the Croatian people's long-standing traditions."
"Religion is one of these and I would stress that, in future, respect must also be shown for aspect's relating to the Croatian people's freedom of religion."
"This too is an example of reciprocal loyalty and richness of diversity, which should, in theory, characterise the European Union."
"- (SK) Mr President, the accession talks with Croatia are entering the final phase."
"Over the past year, Croatia has shown the will to continue with the necessary reforms, particularly with the adoption of substantial amendments and supplements to the constitution, but also with the harmonisation of legislation with the Community acquis, and I would like the Hungarian Presidency now to complete the accession talks with Croatia."
"I applaud the significant progress achieved in the area of public administration, the economy and the judiciary, and I am pleased that Croatia is actively cooperating over the prosecution of war criminals."
"On the other hand, widespread corruption remains a significant social and economic problem, which it is perhaps also necessary to resolve with the assistance of the EU, so that this negative feature is not then transferred into European structures, and I believe that in the popular vote, in the referendum in Croatia, the citizens will confirm the decision of the Croatian state to become a new Member State of the EU."
"(PL) Mr President, the integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union guarantees that the region will be stabilised and that its development will be accelerated."
"The country farthest along in its efforts is Croatia."
"Its progress in many areas is encouraging, including in the fight against corruption, yet at the same time further efforts are needed, including with regard to the independence of the judiciary and greater efficiency of the latter, the public administration reforms and competition policy."
"We are encouraging Croatia to persist in its actions to defend the rights of minorities and to support returning refugees."
"One of the problems which must be resolved by Croatia is improved cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"It should also adopt and accelerate the restructuring and privatisation plan for the shipyards which are experiencing difficulties."
"The biggest challenge, however, may prove to be the scepticism of Croatian society towards accession to the EU."
"I am pleased with the active role played by Croatia in regional cooperation and in improved cooperation with neighbouring countries, and with its efforts towards reconciliation in the region."
"Mr President, I look forward to the accession of Croatia to the European Union, particularly as an Irish MEP."
"Croatia and Ireland are very similar in terms of population - 4.5 million - and will have the exact same number of MEPs - 12."
"Also, at a time when many Eurosceptics are talking about the implosion and the disintegration of the European Union, it is rather paradoxical that countries are queuing up to join the European Union - Croatia being a case in point."
"They are not joining willy-nilly: they are joining as a result of a very rigorous accession process and Croatia has made much progress in that regard."
"Granted, there are problems, particularly regarding the judiciary, but I am sure in due course these matters will be dealt with."
"Of course, no country is without its faults."
"As Our Lord himself said: 'Let he who is without sin cast the first stone'."
"I look forward to Croatia joining the European Union and think it will be a very good member."
"Mr President, the history of Croatia is in some ways the story of a series of political unions contracted by a ruling elite without the consent of the people: first the union with Hungary, then that with the Habsburg monarchy, then the short-lived Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and then of course the Yugoslav Federation."
"So it is progress of a kind that at least the ordinary people of Croatia will have the final word over EU accession."
"Under the current constitutional arrangements, a referendum must be held within 30 days of the contraction of the accession treaty."
"I think there are real losses potentially to Croatia."
"It is a country with an educated and industrious workforce that could do extremely well pricing itself into the market and exploiting the advantages of relatively cheap exports; but I am a democrat, and of course, if the people of Croatia vote in favour of EU accession, if that is their considered will, then I will support their bid when it comes before this Chamber."
"I just raise the question of why some of the existing Member States should not also consult their people on the issue of continued membership."
"On a major constitutional issue of this sort, it seems quite proper that the existing politicians should not be allowed to make permanent derogations of sovereignty without first asking the permission of those they represent."
"Our parliamentarians are not the owners of our freedoms."
"They are their temporary and contingent custodians and, if they want to alienate power from Westminster, they should have the courtesy to ask our permission."
"Mr President, when I discuss the issue of enlargement with my constituents, many of them raise concerns about some of the previous enlargements."
"They worry about certain Member States that were let in which, they feel, had not addressed issues such as corruption and property rights."
"I get many letters from constituents from Member States who joined many years ago, in particular the rights of property holders in Spain, as many of my constituents see their property rights undermined and often lose their life savings."
"I get similar letters from people in Cyprus and from property-owners in Bulgaria."
"Leaving that aside, let us look at the picture in Croatia at the moment."
"The issues that people write to me about quite often are those of press freedom, corruption and property rights."
"It is important that we do not just brush these under the carpet and say 'do not worry about it; it will all be sorted out in due course'."
"These countries and new Member States which apply for membership of the EU need to reassure us over these concerns so that they are not problems we inherit when the EU enlarges and they do not cause problems for the citizens of existing EU Member States."
"Mr President, I have spent some considerable time in Croatia and also taken pains to follow developments there."
"Croatia is a country which is characterised by endemic bribery, corruption, crony capitalism and unexplained wealth amongst the political classes."
"It lacks the basic infrastructure of a free society."
"The rule of law, the rights of property and enforceable contracts are all seriously challenged in Croatia."
"The judicial system is completely log-jammed, so the citizens and companies operating in Croatia cannot effectively appeal for justice."
"The Croatian media are subject to censorship and intimidation."
"If this country, Croatia, is considered a suitable country for joining the European Union, then heaven help all of us."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) In light of the alarming increase in falsified medicines, I am voting for this report."
"The compromise reached in the series of trialogues during the Belgian Presidency demonstrated the importance of harmonising safety issues, especially as regards non-prescription medicines, and the conditions surrounding the removal and replacement of medicines by packagers, which will thus lead to increased transparency in the sector."
"The implementation of penalties has also enhanced these measures, which are considered vital in the fight against falsified medicines in legal supply networks."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution, in which the European Parliament expresses its position on the directive on the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified."
"We must take into account the concern expressed by EU citizens over the quality and safety of the medicinal products they are consuming. All the more so given that experts are observing alarming tendencies: a sharp increase in seizures of falsified medicines by customs (an increase of up to 384% since 2005); a trend towards the falsification of life-saving medicines, which can have fatal consequences; counterfeit medicines are increasingly being found in legal supply chains."
"EU citizens must be very careful when purchasing medicines online, because here the chances of acquiring falsified medicines increases by up to 50%."
"Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they expect them to be."
"The EU must therefore react swiftly and constructively to the dangerous tendencies mentioned."
"This directive is a first step towards ensuring that only high quality medicines are distributed in the EU."
"To achieve this objective I feel that it is very important to establish strict controls and determine responsibility at all levels of manufacturing, distribution and sales."
"Then EU citizens will feel safe when using genuinely high quality medicines."
"I support the statement by Mrs Grossetête, who regretted that, 'we are not as demanding about medicines as we are about food'."
"Figures released by the WHO and also quoted in European studies are alarming."
"Falsifying of medicines is steadily increasing: in 2008 alone, 34 million falsified medicines were seized in the EU, and that is without mentioning the online market for these products, in which it is estimated that 50-90% of the medicinal products available are falsified."
"We are talking about traffic not only in anabolic steroids, stimulants, diuretics and hormones, but also in medicines used to treat a number of dangerous illnesses, which in this case are sold freely and at a lower price, even though they require a prescription."
"I believe that strict regulation to protect public health is essential not only in the legal pharmaceutical supply chain, through the implementation of devices to detect tampering with packages and to track active ingredients in order to establish the source, or through inspections of third-country production sites, but also on the Internet."
"Provisions should also be laid down for online sales, including the introduction of an EU certification logo, a centralised database at national level listing all authorised retailers and severe penalties for traffickers in illegal products."
"Falsified medicines are a global danger."
"Representatives of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warn that falsified products are far from containing the active ingredients mentioned in the package leaflet."
"On the contrary, they are based on substances which are highly toxic for the body."
"I think that European citizens should be informed at both European and national level about the risks posed to their health by products ordered from various uncontrolled websites or from the illegal supply chain, given that the Internet is one of the main routes by which falsified medicines enter the EU market."
"I support the new legislative proposal because it will update the regulations in force and introduce safety features which will guarantee the identification, authentication and traceability of medicines from the factory to the consumer."
"This is the reason why I voted for this report."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this important document."
"The report presented by the Commission notes that seizures of falsified medicines are increasing, and that life-saving medicines intended to treat cancer and heart disease are being falsified."
"Falsified medicines are also increasingly finding their way into the licensed distribution chain."
"This poses a major threat to the health of EU citizens."
"Falsifying of medicinal products must be viewed as a criminal act that denies patients the necessary medical treatment and is harmful to their health, sometimes even leading to their death."
"Therefore the objective of the directive should be the protection of public health, ensuring a high level of quality control of the import of medicinal products, since this is one of the key entry doors of falsified medicines to the European market."
"Furthermore, it is crucial to create an inspections system and an efficient falsification detection system."
"I believe that it is essential to properly regulate and control the sale of medicines on the Internet, because this is one of the main routes for falsified medicinal products to enter the European market."
"I voted for this report as European citizens are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality and safety of medicines."
"Patients must be absolutely certain that the medicines they are taking are actually the medicines they expect to take."
"The use of falsified medicines may cause the treatment to fail and jeopardise lives."
"I think, as the rapporteur also does, that falsifying medicines is a criminal act which deprives patients of the medical treatment they require and harms their health, even resulting in death in some cases."
"For this reason, the directive's first and most important objective should be to protect public health against falsified medicines."
"The level of public awareness also needs to be raised about the risks of buying medicines via the Internet."
"We must guarantee patients that they can recognise websites which comply with the relevant legislation."
"A directive intended to combat the falsification of medicines without targeting the Internet, which is the largest distribution channel, cannot be justified to the public."
"Now that population ageing is the long-term demographic trend throughout our European continent, it is certain that expenditure on medicines will increase further in our countries."
"While, on the one hand, we must gauge the impact of this and reflect on consumption, it is also essential to fight against the increasing falsification of medicines."
"Leaving aside the detrimental financial impact on European research, this is an urgent public health issue for Europe today."
"The European Parliament was right to take things in hand."
"The report in question on the prevention of the entry into the supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified highlights an important element of concern for the European public, namely the quality and safety of the medicines they use."
"Therefore, I welcome the provisions that will make it possible to combat the phenomenon of falsified medicines and which represent a necessary step towards responding to this rising public health threat and ensuring patients' safety."
"After some six months of negotiations, the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council is certainly an improvement on the existing regulatory system."
"More specifically, it regulates the sale of medicines over the Internet, which is one of the main channels through which falsified medicines enter the EU market."
"In fact, in order to operate, online pharmacies in Member States must obtain special permits to supply products to the public over the Internet."
"Lastly, because I believe that the falsification of medicines should not be viewed as a minor offence - we need only think of the implications of falsifying life-saving drugs - but rather as criminal activity that endangers human lives, I fully support the strengthening of sanctions."
"Health is the most important asset in everyone's life."
"The commercial availability of a variety of falsified medicines, especially life-saving medicines, has therefore rightly aroused the fears of citizens."
"The vast and steadily growing number of counterfeit products seized in the EU every year may be reason for concern."
"It is therefore necessary for us to respond decisively to this phenomenon, which is nothing other than organised criminal activity."
"Patients must be absolutely sure that the medicines they take are authentic."
"This is why I support the rapporteur's position that protection against counterfeit drugs should be the overriding aim of the directive, from which we must not be diverted."
"I fully agree too with the proposal to include the online distribution of drugs in the directive."
"In such cases patients are mainly reliant on themselves, and their medical knowledge does not necessarily enable them to identify a fake product."
"The rules must be clear when it comes to such an important issue as health."
"We should eliminate any risks."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because we must take into account a concern which is getting higher and higher on the agenda of the European citizens: the quality and safety of the medicinal products they are consuming."
"There is data indicating a sharp increase in seizures of falsified medicines by customs."
"For instance, 2.7 million medicinal products were confiscated at EU custom borders in 2006 and 2.5 million in 2007, hence seizures of medicines are up 384% compared to 2005."
"The report observes a trend from the falsification of 'lifestyle' medicines to life-saving medicines, including medicines to treat cancer and heart disease, psychiatric disorders and infections."
"Treatment with such falsified medicines can have fatal consequences."
"Furthermore, there is a trend towards targeting the classical supply chain."
"Besides the Internet, the licensed distribution chain is increasingly targeted."
"Out of the 13 Member States that had data, seven reported incidences of counterfeit medicinal products in the legal supply chain."
"Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they expect them to be."
"The use of falsified medicines can result in therapeutic failure and can put lives at risk."
"I therefore believe that the protection of public health against falsified medicines should be the main focus of the directive."
"This focus should not be troubled by other additional objectives."
"The counterfeiting of medicines has become a profitable business, with minimal risk of accountability before the law."
"This situation is highlighted by the fact that, in 2008 alone, the customs authorities announced that more than 34 million counterfeit medicinal products were confiscated in Europe."
"Admittedly, the EU has not yet reached the situation of other geographical areas where up to 30% of the medicines available on the market are counterfeit."
"However, the EU must not allow this situation to be reached."
"It is currently estimated that 1% of medicinal products sold are counterfeit, but there are warnings indicating that this proportion is on the rise."
"The new safety regulations adopted by Parliament, the penalties imposed on the manufacturers of counterfeit medicines and the control system between manufacturers and consumers are intended to halt the growth of the pharmaceutical black market in the EU."
"Therefore, the introduction of new, mandatory safety regulations governing the trading of medicinal products, including those sold via the Internet, is a welcome step."
"Selling counterfeit medicines is a criminal activity with serious repercussions which can affect a huge number of consumers who very often choose the easy route of the Internet to order medicines which they would otherwise not be able to access without a medical recommendation."
"The number of falsified medicinal products is rising sharply in all European countries."
"This is confirmed by recent findings indicating that 1.5 million falsified boxes are sold each year in Europe by the legal pharmaceutical supply chain."
"New estimates also suggest a worrying increase in this phenomenon, which also includes online medicine sales and, even more seriously, increasingly involves novel 'life-saving' drugs."
"A new European strategy must therefore be implemented as soon as possible so as to combat this phenomenon and to better protect public health and European consumers."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report, because I think it has the merit of having achieved a good compromise, the main aim of which is to protect patients so that they do not take falsified medicines."
"We must act as a matter of urgency in response to the alarming increase in medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source."
"These products normally contain low-quality or falsified substances, representing a serious threat to public health, and also leading to a loss of patient trust in the legal supply chain."
"The verification requirements pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to should be stepped up in order to avoid these risks."
"Safety features for medicines should also be harmonised within the EU, and should enable each individual pack to be identified and its authenticity verified."
"They should also identify any falsified products, while ensuring the functioning of the internal market for medicines."
"The risk-assessment process should take account of criteria such as the cost of medicines and the history of falsified medicines in the EU and in third countries, as well as the effects these falsified products have on public health, in terms of the specific nature of the products in question and of the severity of the conditions they are intended to treat."
"The safety features should enable the verification of every pack of medicine that is supplied, regardless of the method of supply used, including those available via distance-selling channels."
"The marketing of falsified medicinal products has increased public health risks over recent years."
"There are worrying data that, apart from the Internet, more and more falsified medicinal products are entering the legal supply chain."
"I voted in favour of the Matias report because:"
"1."
"It puts patient protection at the heart of the legislative proposal, by adopting measures to provide access to a high standard of safe and appropriate treatment and information."
"2."
"It includes and regulates online sales of medicinal products, which were missing from the Commission proposal, despite the fact that over 50% of medicinal products purchased online are falsified."
"3."
"It establishes safety features for prescription and non-prescription (black-listed) medicinal products, in the aim of preventing falsified medicinal products from entering the legal supply chain."
"4."
"It demands full traceability of medicinal products and, at the same time, establishes an early warning system in all the Member States, so that medicinal products which are suspected of being dangerous can be withdrawn."
"5."
"It sees falsification of medicinal products as an organised criminal activity and imposes strict penalties on the offenders."
"6."
"Exports of medicinal products from the EU to third countries must satisfy the same safety criteria as those which apply to imports."
"The falsification of medicines is an organised crime that endangers peoples' lives just like narcotics trafficking."
"Nevertheless, this type of crime is neither regulated in the same way nor subject to the same level of penalties as narcotics-related crimes."
"Illegally producing medicines by copying, or quite simply omitting, their active ingredients does not require large-scale facilities or investment."
"It is easy to make a large profit."
"Estimated figures have revealed that proceeds from the sale of falsified medicines in 2010 exceeded EUR 50.6 million, which therefore represents a 95% increase as compared to the estimated figures five years ago."
"This increase is largely due to the lack of detailed legislation in some countries because of either a lack of resources or the unwillingness to implement it, and to the fact that the level of penalty set out does not have a truly deterrent effect."
"I support the compromise reached by the rapporteur: it is balanced and its primary objective is to protect patients."
"This is a step in the right direction, even though it excludes important issues such as, for example, the fact that generic medicines and non-prescription medicines are not covered by the implementation of safety features."
"in writing. - (RO) Given the ever-growing risks to patients from counterfeit medicines, I think that interim measures to strengthen patient safety need to be introduced urgently."
"These measures must stipulate that manufacturing authorisation holders who remove or cover up overt safety features applied on a voluntary basis by manufacturers be held strictly liable in the event of counterfeits entering the supply chain as a result of their actions."
"I voted in favour of this report, as it aims to combat at EU level falsified medicines within the legal supply chain without hampering the functioning of the internal market in medicines."
"It aims to do so, for example, by introducing obligations for operators in the distribution chain, by prohibiting those operators situated between the original manufacturer and the final operator in the distribution chain (generally the pharmacist) or the end user (doctor/patient) from manipulating (that is removing, modifying or covering) the safety features on the packaging, and by establishing stricter criteria governing the importation of active pharmaceutical ingredients from third countries and product inspections."
"in writing. - The quality of medicinal products is crucial to ensure safety, and to give peace of mind to consumers."
"It is clear that there is a rising threat to the health of our constituents as a result of these products flooding the market, especially with falsifications becoming more sophisticated year on year."
"This is a public health crisis on a global scale."
"It is currently estimated that perhaps 15% of the global medicine supply is counterfeit, while it is estimated that in some developing countries over 30% of medicines on sale may be counterfeit."
"The public needs to be 100% sure that the products they consume are safe and fit for purpose."
"The use of falsified medicines can have a serious detrimental impact on a patient's health, in some cases leading to death."
"It is clear that a comprehensive strategy on tackling this issue is vital, both at national and international level, in order to ensure that high standards of public health and safety are maintained."
"I voted in favour of the report on falsified medicinal products, which includes measures for combatting the alarming rise in falsified medicinal products in the EU, such as safety features for verifying the authenticity of the product throughout the supply chain, with a view to patient safety and protecting public health."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has decided to enforce these safety features not only on the conventional supply chain but also on sales via the Internet, which is the main gateway for falsified products."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament advocates the need for controls on medicines entering and leaving the EU and plans to implement heavy penalties, as these crimes are endangering lives."
"I believe that consumer safety is a matter of vital importance, particularly when the consumers involved are also patients who are seeking a cure from the medicines they take, or at least a significant improvement in their health."
"Consumer safety is of even greater importance when it aims to safeguard the authenticity of medicinal products sold on the open market, whether through traditional channels or over the Internet."
"For this very reason, I consider it vital that very clear regulations be adopted on the falsification of medicinal products, as this is a growing phenomenon throughout Europe and the rest of the world which has devastating effects on consumer confidence, on companies and, even more importantly, on the health of those who take these falsified medicines."
"I therefore support this report and would congratulate Mrs Matias on the work she has carried out and on all the compromises that she has negotiated."
"in writing. - (PT) The clandestine trade in medicinal products has already been compared with the illegal trade in weapons of war and drug trafficking."
"It is a scourge that affects millions of people around the world, and which is a nightmare for those whose duty it is to look after public health: someone who is ill, often with chronic or terminal diseases could take something that is harmless and has no effect, or even take something that could even be harmful."
"We know that there are increasing amounts of counterfeit or falsified medicinal products in circulation, with the figures running into the millions."
"It is essential that we fight organised crime and cross-border traffickers and put an end to parallel marketing circuits, for example on the Internet."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of tamper-evident packaging and the creation of an early warning system."
"I welcome the adoption of this directive of Parliament and the Council which, by tracking the entire product cycle, will prevent falsified and/or counterfeit medicinal products from being brought into the European Union and will reinforce the protection of public health by improving the quality and safety of the medicinal products consumed."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, my compatriot, Mrs Matias, on the work she has done."
"in writing. - (PT) This is a problem with serious effects on public health and on the economies of the Member States."
"The falsification of medicinal products and the alarming quantities entering the legal supply chain are worrying issues that need to be duly addressed and combated."
"It should not be forgotten that medicinal products are only falsified and sold illegally because there are economic reasons that encourage this phenomenon, as the existence of generic medicinal products at prices that people can afford makes falsification less profitable."
"The report tackles the relevant issue of sales via the Internet, which is part of the legal supply chain."
"It refers to the importance of raising public awareness to the risks associated with purchasing medicinal products in this manner."
"We would highlight the importance of strengthening cooperation and coordination between competent national authorities, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other international bodies, with a view to exchanging information, enabling increased knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon and, in this way, improving the fight."
"It should be remembered that such cooperation must also work in other areas, such as pharmacovigilance."
"Greater transparency is demanded from existing European structures, such as the EMA, with regard to the studies they carry out and their operations."
"We believe that the compromise reached is a positive step in the essential fight against this problem."
"The quality and safety of the medical products being sold to the people of Ireland is a matter of great concern."
"I welcome this proposal, which aims to curb falsified medical products."
"This is an important and necessary measure."
"We voted for the Matias report on falsified medicines."
"This is indeed a public health and safety issue in a Europe without borders where the worst counterfeit or simply poor-quality rubbish can circulate freely."
"However, there is no guarantee that, in matters of health, medicine or pharmacovigilance, the European Union is best placed to resolve any problems that may arise."
"It may even be the cause of them, for example with the 2004 Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products, coupled with the 2006 Regulation on health claims."
"The former includes the requirement for products to be registered with the European Medicines Agency, a procedure so complex and so costly that only 200 herbal medicinal products had been registered by the end of 2010."
"The other gives the European Food Safety Authority the power to authorise or not health claims for food supplements, including plants, an authorisation which it gives so rarely and refuses on such arbitrary grounds that it has even upset the Commission."
"The upshot is that European legislation will end up favouring chemical medicines and pharmaceutical laboratories."
"Is there a desire to eradicate the natural medicines sector?"
"Who or what will benefit from this?"
"Not necessarily the health of the people of Europe."
"Falsified medicines now account for 10% of pharmaceutical products sold worldwide, and Europe is by no means safe from this scourge, which is, moreover, developing in a worrying fashion."
"I am therefore pleased that this text has been approved by Parliament, since we MEPs have fought to improve the European Commission's initial proposal in which the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industries took precedence over the health and safety of the European people."
"Thus this new text also takes account of online sales of medicines, which are to be better regulated and controlled, for the good of all."
"I agree with the Matias report's assertion that patients must have absolute certainty as to the quality of the medicines they take."
"From studies it is clear that the use of falsified medicines is so dangerous for patients that it puts lives at risk: it is therefore right to consider falsification to be a criminal act warranting the adoption of a strong stance by the European Union."
"Hence my support for the points contained in the report, namely: that there should be clear definitions relating not only to the scope, but also to the different actors in the supply chain, in order to clarify their roles and responsibilities; that sanctions should be equivalent to those applied for illegal acts involving narcotics; and that there should be enhanced transparency and regulation of medicine sales on the Internet, thereby enabling consumers to distinguish between illegal operators and online pharmacies."
"Today, more than ever, active collaboration between different national and international agencies is emerging as a key factor in a more effective system to combat pharmaceutical falsification."
"Such a system can ensure appropriate monitoring not only of pharmaceutical falsification within the European Union but also of falsified medicines exported to third countries, the numbers of which continue to increase."
"The guiding principle should be patient welfare in all cases."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report because we must take into account a concern which is getting higher and higher on the agenda of European citizens: the quality and safety of the medicinal products they are consuming."
"It is estimated that 1% of medicinal products currently sold to the European public through the legal supply chain are fake."
"In other parts of the world more than 30% of the medicines on sale can be fake."
"More and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit."
"It is well known that the Internet represents one of the main routes for falsified medicinal products to enter the European market."
"Medicinal products purchased over the Internet from sites that conceal their actual physical address are estimated to be falsified in more than 50 % of cases."
"People looking for cheaper medicines on the Internet are often hooked in by fraudsters selling counterfeit medicines with ingredients that pose a health risk."
"A lot of fake medicine is getting into the legal supply chain during repackaging."
"For too long we have lacked a proper response to dishonest repackagers and fraudsters rampant in the vastness of the Internet, while an ever increasing number of people buying medicines from untrustworthy websites have begun to put their health or even their lives at risk."
"I am pleased that penalties for counterfeiters have been set, along with measures to ensure a more stringent review."
"Registered pharmacies in countries where the sale of medicines over the Internet is permitted must obtain a special licence; their websites must carry the European logo and be included in the European database."
"Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they need to take."
"The protection of public health against falsified medicines should be the main focus."
"in writing. - (DE) I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council were able to agree on a compromise with regard to the problem of falsified medicinal products."
"This is particularly important because the falsification of medicinal products has now become a very serious problem, which has widened to include life-saving preparations."
"With the measures that have been adopted we have taken an important step in the right direction, without excessive bureaucracy."
"First and foremost, new safety features are to be applied to the packaging and the monitoring of distribution channels is to be improved."
"In this way, we will achieve greater safety for patients - which, in view of the extent of the falsification of medicinal products, was urgently needed - without imposing excessive burdens on the parties involved."
"We take medicines to relieve pain, to alleviate the symptoms of diseases or to save our lives."
"It happens frequently that we spend significant sums on them, which in many instances account for the majority of our income."
"This is why dishonest people, devoid of moral principles, counterfeit medicinal products."
"Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that a patient dies as a result of taking these medicines."
"It is therefore necessary to step up precautions with regard to imports of drugs from third countries, to limit the sale of medicines over the Internet to a minimum, to initiate a campaign to raise patients' awareness of the risks of taking non-certified counterfeit medicines and a campaign that ensures that those buying medicines are aware that counterfeit medicinal products are in circulation."
"I agree with the rapporteur that copyright protection is not a priority here."
"The most important aspect is human health and life, and it is our duty to do everything in our power to protect them."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the directive on combating falsified medicines."
"In light of the number of counterfeit medicines confiscated in the European Union (more than 34 million counterfeit pills were confiscated in 2008), it is high time for the European Union to set up an effective traceability system to guarantee the origin and the quality of medicines available in the European Union."
"This is all the more necessary given that counterfeit medicines pose a real risk to European's health in view of the substances - toxic substances at times - that they may contain."
"The new measures introduced, that is, electronic serial numbers on the packaging of prescription medicines allowing them to be traced from the factory to the patient; limitation on handling during repackaging stages; and strengthening of inspections of manufacturers and wholesalers, represent a concrete step forward that will guarantee the people and patients of Europe a greater level of safety."
"Finally, I should like to point to the progress made in this text in relation to online medicine sales."
"Given that an estimated 50% of medicines purchased on the Internet are counterfeit, this text establishes a common logo to allow for the identification of legal online pharmacies."
"Nonetheless, it is up to the people of Europe to exercise vigilance when making purchases of this nature online."
"in writing. - (RO) Falsified medicinal products pose a real threat to the entire pharmaceutical system in Europe since, apart from the danger patients are exposed to by taking such products, this results in a decline in the general public's confidence in the quality of the medicinal products available in pharmacies."
"The number of falsified medicinal products is rising extremely rapidly in the EU."
"They may contain inferior or falsified ingredients, or they may not contain any at all or their doses may be incorrect."
"Although the scale of this problem is still relatively minor in Europe, unlike in other regions, I voted for this report as I think that there are a number of factors indicating the need for measures to be adopted promptly at EU level."
"The new directive will include penalties imposed on the manufacturers of counterfeit medicines, enhanced safety regulations and a verification system whose aim is to prevent dangerous medicinal products reaching the European market."
"One encouraging aspect is that the European Parliament has successfully added to the European Commission's proposal the regulation of the sale of these products via the Internet, which is the main channel for introducing counterfeit medicines into the EU market."
"In today's vote I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Matias on falsified medicinal products."
"I believe that the document adopted today will reduce the growing problem of counterfeit medicines and introduce a well-functioning system for monitoring the European market, from the manufacturer to the patient."
"I am convinced that coordination between the various national and international bodies is necessary, and we are taking a step forward towards strengthening this cooperation by approving the report."
"I believe that the problem of counterfeit medicines in Europe is a serious one and the European Parliament, by adopting the report, is sending out a clear message to the Commission that only effective cooperation and the effective enforcement of sanctions will make it possible to reduce this practice. Thank you."
"in writing. - Counterfeit medicines are already widespread in the developing world where 20-30% of medicines on the market are fake."
"They are now being found increasingly in the EU."
"Around 1% of medicines sold in Europe are estimated counterfeit."
"This new agreement, which I welcome, will introduce mandatory safety features, such as seals and serial numbers for prescription medicines."
"This will allow for their traceability."
"Generics will not be included in the requirements unless a certain product is at exceptional risk of being counterfeited."
"The draft report does a good job of continuing the work carried out in the previous parliamentary term."
"The Commission proposal avoids giving specific definitions, despite the many recommendations."
"This kind of approach may lead to incomplete or unenforceable protection for patients who are consumers of medicinal products."
"That is why I welcome Amendment 120, which makes the Commission's proposal much less ambiguous."
"Particularly useful is the definition of a 'falsified medicinal product'."
"The proposed text regarding 'supply chains' is also excellent, and if approved would strengthen the right of patients to protection."
"I consider the implementation of Recital 5c of Amendment 120, enabling the enforcement and monitoring of compliance with EU rules, to be imperative."
"The amendment brings EU regulations into line with the findings of the Court of Justice."
"In this context, the proposed text also allows Member States to take their own action in support of greater consumer protection."
"Parliament's amendments do not call for the safety systems to be extended to over-the-counter medicines."
"Nevertheless, our fellow citizens purchase larger numbers of these medicines."
"Their health is therefore at risk."
"Nor do they call for the obligation for the European Medicines Agency to exercise total transparency with regard to its research and to the collusion between its officials and the pharmaceutical companies."
"This, however, is necessary."
"The scandalous case of benfluorex, known by the name of Mediator in France, is proof positive of this."
"However, the amendments tabled are along the right lines, particularly those concerning the public authentication of Internet sites and sanctions."
"I am therefore voting for this report."
"Since this is a very serious problem that puts public health in the EU at risk, I believe the implementation of new rules is key to protecting patients from falsified medicinal products."
"That is why, on 23 April 2010, I asked the European Commission a question about a joint operation involving the 27 Member States, called 'Medi-Fake', which at the time had confiscated 34 million counterfeit tablets in only two months."
"For this reason, I have always supported severe measures to combat this situation, as a way of closing down a trade that represents EUR 45 billion of profit to some criminal networks."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"in writing. - (ES) I have voted in favour of the legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source, as I consider that it positively strengthens the measures against counterfeit medicines and their distribution and, therefore, improves the protection of citizens."
"Furthermore, I think it is very positive that Parliament's position reinforces the transparency and the right to information as a means to prevent this illegal activity."
"I consider it important that it focuses on the improvement of preventative measures in regard to the supply of counterfeit medicines through the Internet."
"I support stepping up the legal fight against the distribution of those medicines via the Internet since the majority of cases of counterfeit medicines entering the European market occur in this way."
"I have voted in favour of the text as the amendments considerably improve the text put forward by the Commission as they strengthen control measures, increase transparency, improve access to information and, therefore, enable improved protection for citizens."
"President Jacques Chirac said that the most intolerable inequality is inequality in health."
"That is why I voted in favour of this report, which focuses on health and therefore the protection of consumers."
"Falsified medicinal products are a scourge that has long been ignored."
"While developing countries are an obvious target, because the cost of legal medicines is often beyond the reach of the majority and the controls are scarcely effective if not indeed non-existent, we are also seeing more and more falsified medicines entering the EU, particularly via the Internet."
"This is a growing threat to public health and to safety in general, and it exists throughout the world."
"The EU must remain vigilant and energetically pursue a purposeful policy against this unacceptable corruption."
"At present, it is difficult to put a figure on its economic implications, as production has become more industrialised."
"This is a moral and ethical problem that undermines the credibility and efficacy of health systems."
"For this reason, the fight against falsified medicines should appeal to the conscience of political leaders around the world."
"in writing. - I completely support the report of Marisa Matias."
"However, I consider the measures featured in the report to be insufficient."
"It is necessary to work out and make obligatory for all EU Member States a package of measures covering responsibility for distribution, assistance, production and realisation of counterfeit medicines."
"Measures should include forfeiture of licence from suppliers and distributors of counterfeit medicine, maximum fines and criminal responsibility for all people related to illegal activity in the area of medicine trading."
"The responsibility of the guilty should be no less than if they were drug dealers."
"Only in that way we can stop the distribution of counterfeit products and eradicate the black market in medicines."
"in writing. - (DE) People's health is the greatest asset of our society and we should use appropriate means to promote and maintain it."
"The increased occurrence of falsified medicinal products is exposing more and more patients, including in Europe, to incalculable risks that could even result in them paying with their lives."
"However, I have voted against the report because the proposed measures, particularly the import controls, do not, in my opinion, go far enough."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this resolution because the counterfeiting of medicinal products is a significant problem throughout the EU, and we therefore need to take radical measures to ensure that counterfeit medicines, which could have adverse effects on human health or even life, do not enter the market."
"We must ensure that only safe and effective medicines reach consumers, and we must stop criminal gangs profiting from counterfeit medicines."
"We must make every effort to ensure that a strict labelling system for prescription medicines is in force in the EU, including safety labels that establish the manufacturer and supplier."
"I feel that there should be harsher penalties for medicine counterfeiters, and the control mechanism must operate effectively across the whole of the EU, including every link in the medicine supply chain."
"Particular attention and safety measures must be devoted to the sale of medicines on the Internet, establishing strict licensing, monitoring and control systems."
"Every Member State must take all the measures necessary to ensure the effective functioning of a system that warns the public about dangerous counterfeit or low quality medicines and even creates opportunities to remove such medicines from the market."
"in writing. - (PT) This report is based on a Commission proposal aimed at preventing the introduction of falsified medicinal products to the supply chain, drawing attention to an issue that is of increasing concern to Europeans: the quality and safety of the medicinal products that they use."
"We should highlight the positive effect of this proposal, which promotes debate on a crucial subject, with the ultimate aim of combating falsified medicinal products."
"In fact, the falsification of medicinal products is a crime that deprives the patients of the medical treatment that they need and damages their health, possibly even causing death."
"The main objective of the directive, as the rapporteur rightly points out, should be the protection of public health."
"This objective must be reflected in the directive's legal basis."
"It also seems essential to me to safeguard the distribution network for medicinal products, establishing clear and precise definitions, not only with regard to the scope of the directive's application, but also with regard to the roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved in the supply chain: retailers, distributors, brokers."
"I voted in favour, as I believe it is essential to promote a legislative measure on this, in order to deal with this growing threat to health and to improve patient safety."
"in writing. - There is an alarming increase in the EU of medicinal products which are falsified with regard to their identity, history or source."
"The directive introduces obligatory safety features for all prescriptive medicinal products and a rapid alert system; harmonised safety features to verify authenticity and identify individual packs, providing tampering evidence for medicinal products subject to prescription (possible exclusion of certain products following a risk assessment); no safety features for medicinal products not subject to prescription, unless a risk assessment demonstrates the risk of falsification and consequently a threat to public health; traceability: there will be a unique identifier for the safety features (e.g. a serialisation number) which allows the authenticity of the product and individual packs to be verified throughout the supply chain up to pharmacy level; in addition, Member States have to set up systems to prevent suspected medicinal products from reaching patients;"
"Internet sales: conditions for the supply of medicinal products to the public are determined by Member States; increased transparency as regards wholesale distributors; penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions must be applied."
"After branded products and cigarettes, counterfeiting has spread to the medicine market, and the seven million medicinal products seized each year account for around 5% of all counterfeits."
"The challenge for the European authorities, judicial as well as customs, is enormous: they have to trace the sources and curb this trafficking, which is endangering millions of lives worldwide."
"I therefore welcome the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council to establish a common legal framework in the 27 Member States to limit the risk of falsified medicines."
"Of the main advances, I would mention: the principle of cascading accountability covering all actors in the chain - manufacturing authorisation holders, wholesale distributors, brokers, and so on; the compulsory use of a security device (serial number or seal) on the packaging of prescription medicines; the introduction of stricter rules on inspections carried out in cooperation with the European Medicines Agency; and the drafting of a list of entities authorised to sell products remotely."
"To conclude, this is an important piece of legislation."
"However, more international cooperation and cyber controls are needed to eradicate falsified Viagra, slimming products, dermatological creams, and so on, which are available at the click of a mouse."
"I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mrs Matias."
"Falsified medicinal products are 'silent killers', even if they have no effect, because they contain toxic substances that can damage or even kill those who take them."
"The absence of a framework law encourages falsification, which is an organised crime."
"We have seen disproportionate growth of this criminal activity, with a 400% increase in seizures of falsified medicinal products since 2005."
"It is estimated that 1% of the medicinal products currently on sale to the European public through the legal supply chain are falsified and that this number is increasing."
"In other parts of the world, more than 30% of the medicines on sale may have been falsified."
"In addition, increasing numbers of innovative and life-saving drugs are falsified."
"We have therefore approved today a new law to prevent the entry of falsified medicines into the legal supply chain and to protect patient safety."
"The legislation also covers Internet sales and introduces new safety devices and traceability measures, as well as penalties for counterfeiters, to prevent the sale of falsified medicines to European Union citizens."
"in writing. - To be able to better safeguard the distribution network for medicinal products it is crucial to have clear definitions not only of the scope, but also of the different actors in the supply chain."
"What is a falsified medicinal product?"
"What is an active ingredient or an excipient?"
"The Commission proposal does not provide the required clarity."
"The same applies for the definitions of the different actors in the chain of supply, clarifying their roles and responsibilities."
"It is essential to make a distinction between those actors who are already formally recognized - and which role is considered liable - and those who are outside that category, although being relevant to the liability of the distribution chain."
"Therefore it is important to make the distinction between traders and brokers, as well as to clarify their roles and responsibilities."
"The same applies for other actors, such as transporters or parallel traders."
"The directive should prevent confusion and should not allow any room for 'grey' areas."
"It should clearly identify which actors are able to operate in this domain and under which conditions."
"Clearer definitions will result in simpler implementation."
"in writing. - The opportunities for selling falsified medicinal products have increased rapidly in recent years."
"The ever-increasing risk of these medicines entering the supply chain means there is an urgent need to update the legislation."
"In particular, regulation of sales on the Internet is notoriously difficult and can only be tackled effectively at international level."
"This issue was not addressed in the Commission's proposal, and the work of the ENVI committee has therefore substantially improved it by adding important safeguards for consumers who purchase medicines online."
"But the nature of the Internet means that we cannot eliminate the risk."
"Consumer awareness of this risk needs to be improved, and so I welcome the inclusion of awareness-raising campaigns for the public which has been agreed as part of the compromise."
"The Commission is in a unique position to coordinate education campaigns for the public and must ensure that the Member States fulfil their obligations in this regard."
"in writing. - (NL) There has been an alarming increase in counterfeit medicines in the EU."
"They may contain inferior quality, counterfeit or inaccurately measured substances, whether active or not, or they may contain no active substances at all, and thus pose a serious danger to the patient."
"For industry, the direct and indirect social costs of taking no action on this certainly amount to more than EUR 10 billion."
"Together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament, I support this agreement."
"It brings existing rules up to date and introduces safety features which ensure the identification, authentication and traceability of the product, whilst regulating the sale of medicines on the Internet."
"That is one of the main routes by which counterfeit drugs end up on the European market."
"It is estimated that more than 50% of medicines purchased over the Internet on sites which do not specify their actual physical address are counterfeit."
"We therefore have to distinguish between legitimate mail order or Internet pharmacies and the illegal distribution chain, which includes uncontrolled Internet purchases."
"A legitimate mail order pharmacy must be connected to a legally registered pharmacy and we have to make sure that any legitimate mail order pharmacy complies with all the legal requirements which apply to pharmacies in the Member State where it is legally established."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report which aims to prevent falsified medicinal products from entering the legal supply chain by increasing harmonisation, improving traceability and by ensuring that penalties are dissuasive and effective."
"Patient safety has to be the priority when dealing with medications."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report because it provides new bases for combating falsified medicinal products."
"There has been a gradual progression from, firstly, the sorts of medicinal products that are susceptible to falsification to later include other medicines in secure packaging."
"The marketing of medicinal products is prevented by the procedure of enquiry and readability."
"Increased protection is provided for consumers."
"The costs for the industry are manageable."
"in writing. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, the amount of falsified medicines entering the EU is growing at a terrific rate."
"This is a particular worry for countries like Lithuania, which forms part of the EU's eastern border."
"Eastern Europe is the main route of the trade in falsified medicines worth billions."
"This is a major problem - the Commission puts the number of boxes of falsified medicines sold within the legal supply chain each year in Europe at 1.5 million."
"Even more alarming is the fact that volumes are increasing by up to 20%."
"Falsified medicines are silent killers."
"The people distributing them are dangerous criminals and should be viewed as such."
"Penalties for counterfeiting medicine should be the same as for drug trafficking."
"This will require improved coordination between various national and international institutions."
"We must clamp down on the sale of falsified medicines online, because the Internet is one of the main routes for falsified medicinal products to enter the European market."
"According to the World Health Organisation, 50% of the medicines sold online are falsified."
"I believe that one of our priorities should be to draw the public's attention to the risks involved in buying medicines online."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the legislative motion for a resolution of the European Parliament on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the prevention of the entry into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source."
"There can be no doubt that the appearance of falsified medicines in official distribution channels represents a threat to the entire European pharmaceutical system, by undermining the trust of citizens in the quality of drugs purchased in pharmacies or other legal outlets."
"In my opinion, the most disturbing aspect is the change in the risk profile."
"To date, counterfeit products have mainly come under the heading of 'life-style' drugs, whereas there is currently a dramatic increase in the number of counterfeit life-saving medicines."
"It is therefore important to establish a clear and unambiguous definition of a 'falsified medicinal product'. but also to define all the entities in the distribution chain, such as sellers and agents who must operate on the basis of permits and abide by the rules of good manufacturing practices, as do the manufacturers and distributors."
"In view of the above, I consider that it is necessary and a matter of priority to support any measures aimed at minimising this problem."
"in writing. - (PT) I only voted for this motion for a resolution because of the Commission's strong commitment to improving the finance schemes currently being used to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have greater access to capital to fund their growth and innovation policies."
"One thing that is relevant in the current context of the economic crisis is the removal of the 'red tape' effect in the current EU support schemes."
"Despite agreeing with the measures proposed in this resolution, I would draw the Commission's attention to the need to make progress with a more ambitious measure, the 'Small Business Act', for the post-2013 programming period."
"It should be remembered that in the current situation it is more important than ever to have strong institutional and financial support for SMEs, as they are the backbone of the European economy and will only manage to grow with adequate and sustainable finance istruments."
"I voted in favour of this important motion for a resolution on practical aspects regarding the revision of EU instruments to support SME finance in the next programming period."
"The 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment."
"However, the limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth, particularly faced with the current financial and economic crisis."
"I therefore agree with the resolution's call for a significant increase in funding for innovative financial instruments under the EU budget to cater for the financing needs of SMEs, and in light of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"However, it should be noted that the current EU financial regulations on the use of European funds and programmes are unduly complicated, and the expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding."
"I therefore agree with the call for the Commission to propose simplified and less costly regulations and guidelines, especially for programmes intended to support low-volume SME finance."
"Last October, the European Commission presented a policy paper entitled 'An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era', which contains a number of specific initiatives intended to give a strong impetus to European industrial policy."
"SMEs are, as Commissioner Tajani described them in Parliament yesterday, the 'lifeblood' of economic development."
"One job in four depends on the industrial sector, as do our global competitiveness, innovation and research."
"Commitment and coordination between European and national institutions, banks and SMEs are required if we are to bring down bureaucratic barriers and simplify rules."
"Many forward strides have been made in recent months with the adoption of the Late Payment Directive, the protection of trademarks and products, the opportunities for the development of the green economy and new policies focused on tourism, but much more remains to be done."
"Many companies in the EU are dependent on EU funding and incentives, which is why access to credit must be guaranteed and improved."
"This is in fact a priority objective that I hope will be thoroughly addressed in the review of the Small Business Act, which will be presented on 23 February in Rome by Commissioner Tajani himself."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs."
"They make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation."
"The limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their growth, and the continuing financial and economic crisis has restricted their access to funding even further."
"The banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums."
"I believe that the availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes are crucial to ensuring this sector's viability, growth and potential to create jobs."
"Much attention must be paid to European Investment Bank SME loans, as EUR 15 billion was allocated to these in 2008, but research shows that only a small proportion of this money reached SMEs, because the banks administering loans in the Member States tightened bank credits."
"I believe that the European Commission must take the necessary measures to make sure that allocated funding reaches SMEs, ensuring the viability and growth of this very important sector."
"I am impressed by the number of SMEs in the European Union, 23 million, and by the number of jobs they provide - 100 million. These figures clearly highlight that we need to strengthen the scheme for financing this sector."
"However the European financing scheme is both diverse and complicated."
"I agree with the initiators of this motion for a resolution that the scheme needs to be as coherent as possible during the 2014-2020 financing period."
"I support the initiators' idea of asking the Commission to encourage Member States to carry out the necessary reforms."
"These SMEs encounter each other on the single market, but receive different levels of support in their national environment."
"I also believe in the benefit of a point of single contact for all EU financial instruments intended for SMEs as a solution for balancing national support systems with European systems."
"The employment crisis is more than sufficient grounds for adopting a text in which the appeal to apply the principle of subsidiarity to the area of pensions finally recognises the fact that the governments must be the main players in the rebuilding of social Europe."
"Only a brave decision in favour of grass-roots democracy, based on employment reforms that make work more attractive and on payslip federalism that takes account of the different costs of living in each region of Europe - against which both wages and pensions would be readjusted - would constitute a real change of direction towards renewal."
"I would point out the central role of SMEs in all of this."
"There are large numbers of them in Europe, which means that they create jobs and sustainability."
"Lowering the cost of work by reducing taxes, and giving our small enterprises the chance to carry on working and investing in the region are essential moves to ensure equalisation of contributions for the older generations and a future of certainty and quality of life for the new ones."
"in writing. - (LT) It should be noted that a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will continue to depend mainly on credits and loans when it comes to external financing."
"We need to draw attention to the fact that an increasingly capital- and risk-sensitive banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums, both requirements resulting in insufficient financing and missed business and employment opportunities in this very large sector of the economy."
"Given this, I believe that the availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes are crucial to exploiting the growth and job potential offered by SMEs."
"There is a need therefore to leverage existing programmes at national and EU levels."
"It is very important to continue to implement guarantee instruments in the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), the Risk-Sharing and Financing Facility under the Seventh Framework Programme and the Structural Funds (JEREMIE)."
"Their proper implementation is currently being hindered by overly complex administrative procedures, therefore the Commission should make it easier to use the Structural Funds in connection with SME finance instruments, particularly to finance revolving funds for guarantee schemes, whilst avoiding the creation of structures which duplicate existing schemes."
"Given the fact that many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) depend on credit and loans for external funding, there is a need to create credit and loan guarantee schemes, and to boost the role of the European Investment Bank in this area."
"The Commission should also push for the removal of barriers to the development of European venture capital and bond markets, and should expand risk-sharing facilities for investments in equity."
"There is a related need to increase awareness of the risks of many national taxation and support systems, which provide strong incentives for debt financing and disincentives for equity financing."
"I think that the complexity of EU financial regulations and guidelines for European financial instruments is a serious problem, in particular when European funds and programmes are used to support individual enterprises through the provision of relatively small amounts of funding."
"The expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding."
"The fragmented nature of programmes supporting SMEs is also problematic."
"The Commission should establish greater coherence between the CIP, FP7 and JEREMIE programmes and create a one-stop shop where SMEs would be able to obtain clear and comprehensive information about how to make use of these instruments."
"in writing. - (PT) The 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU play a crucial role in economic growth, social cohesion and job creation."
"I find the limited access that SMEs have to finance regrettable, and this is aggravated by the current financial and economic crisis."
"It is crucial that credit lines and guarantee schemes be available, so that the potential for growth and employment offered by SMEs may be explored."
"I welcome the creation of 'Progress', a new EU micro-finance facility for jobs."
"I support the implementation of the guarantee instruments within the scope of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, the Risk-Sharing and Financing Facility under the Seventh Framework Programme and the Structural Funds, and the Joint Action to Support Micro-Finance Institutions in Europe initiative."
"However, I call on the Commission to make using the Structural Funds easier and more flexible with regard to SME finance schemes."
"I also call for increased funding for innovative financial instruments in the EU budget, for the development of simplified, less costly regulations and guidelines."
"in writing. - (RO) I think that the European Commission's specific strategies, measures and action plans for European SMEs need to be improved."
"I support the creation of a new European instrument for providing micro-finance for employment and for improving the regulations and SMEs' access to the single market and financing."
"As the providers of some 100 million jobs in Europe, SMEs are the backbone of the European economy."
"However, only 2% of them have access to EU funding."
"That is why I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament calling in particular for special attention to be paid to SME finance in the next EU programming period (2014-2020), through the use of innovative financial instruments."
"I welcome the clear message sent to the Commission and the Council by Parliament: it calls on them to remove the administrative obstacles that are particularly difficult for small businesses to overcome and which prevent them from gaining access to EU funding and support programmes."
"in writing. - Small and medium-size enterprises will play a vital role in reinvigorating economies across Europe that are currently witnessing economic contraction or, at best, slight economic growth."
"In my constituency of Northern Ireland, 98% of all companies can be classified as SMEs."
"It is essential that SMEs are given as much support as possible to play their part in the economic recovery, yet what do they currently face?"
"They face a squeeze from banks when it comes to existing credit and the future credit that is necessary to their existence."
"The EU must therefore look at ways of encouraging banks to lend whilst ensuring that the mechanisms put in place by the EU to support SMEs are accessible."
"The current programmes must be streamlined and simplified, making application and access easier."
"Already burdened by huge amounts of EU red tape, many SMEs with limited manpower simply do not have the capacity or time to go through the current application processes."
"Some are not even designed with those who are in real need in mind."
"The programmes in place have the potential to help, but that help must be easier to obtain."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution as I advocate changing the way that small and medium-sized enterprises access European finance, which constitutes an important means for their creation and growth, bearing in mind the effects of the current financial and economic crisis, which has exacerbated the problem of these companies' access to public and private finance."
"There are approximately 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union."
"Their importance to national economies and their growth potential for the labour market is undeniable."
"Portugal is an example of this: approximately 300 000 SMEs represent more than 99% of the total number of companies, and these are directly responsible for more than 2 million jobs and have a combined turnover of some EUR 170 billion."
"As a result of the recent economic crisis, the financing capacity of these SMEs, which was already limited, became significantly worse, specifically because of even more restrictive credit conditions imposed by the banking sector."
"The functioning of SME finance schemes therefore becomes all the more essential, specifically through a greater Union budget allocation for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme of the Structural Funds and the Seventh Framework Programme."
"It is also important to progressively correct market failures and remove administrative barriers."
"The right measures should be taken at the right time so that the national economies of the Member States can achieve their potential for growth and contribute to the growth of the labour market; this will enable the Member States to develop, which will result in social cohesion."
"in writing. - (PT) This European Parliament motion for a resolution deals with practical aspects regarding the revision of EU instruments to support finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the next programming period."
"The number of small companies has been increasing significantly in Europe in recent years."
"They already represent 99% of the total, are responsible for approximately 100 million jobs, and make a crucial contribution to economic growth and social cohesion."
"Despite this situation, it has been very hard for them to access finance, and this has worsened with the current financial crisis, during which the banking sector has introduced tough requirements for accessing their finance mechanisms."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of this resolution, and I hope that there will be a significant strengthening of SME finance schemes and a simplification of administrative procedures, specifically by reducing the number of programmes, and by making national and EU programmes complement each other better."
"in writing. - (PT) This motion for a resolution is very contradictory given that, although it contains some positive references to the measures needed to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it ascribes legitimacy to and calls for the same type of policies that form the basis of the problems currently affecting SMEs, specifically the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), the liberalisation of the financial markets and so-called free competition."
"This only serves to protect the economic and financial interest groups that charge high prices to make ever greater profits, whether by issuing credit or through the prices of energy and other commodities."
"Right now, what is needed is an effective change in Union policy."
"The time is right to abandon the SGP and its irrational criteria, and replace it with a genuine pact for employment and social progress that incentivises small-scale investments; that gives micro-enterprises the opportunity to grow and, especially, to support groups - for example, young entrepreneurs - that are having problems finding borrowing opportunities for their business ideas; and that promotes employment with rights and improved living conditions, so that the population's purchasing power increases."
"I believe that this motion for a resolution constitutes in some respects an overdue action for an economic sector - that of small and medium-sized enterprises - which plays a significant role in the EU economy."
"A review of support tools is also appropriate in the context of an economic crisis that has had a particularly virulent effect on SMEs, as eloquently documented by the loss of 3 250 000 jobs between 2009 and 2010 alone (more than a third of the new jobs that this sector had created)."
"In this context, I consider it important to stress the cooperation between the European Commission and the European Bank, giving particular support to investments that are able to maximise the effectiveness of SME finance programmes."
"In particular, it is necessary to ensure the continuity of credit through action on liquidity and capital requirements and new initiatives in three strategic areas to boost the competitiveness of companies in a phase that is still difficult but certainly more development-oriented: internationalisation, innovation and growth in size."
"With its directive against late payment by public authorities, Europe has already sent out an important signal to support SMEs, and it is right to continue in this direction if it wishes to stimulate economic growth in Europe."
"in writing. - SMEs form an essential part of the backbone of the European economy and are the main drivers for job creation, economic growth, social cohesion and innovation in Europe."
"The participation and active role of SMEs are imperative for the advancement of the competitiveness of the single market."
"Following the financial crisis, it has become evident that the European financial markets are currently unable to provide SMEs with adequate finance mechanisms."
"Innovative and growth-oriented small businesses need to raise equity capital from external sources, because they either do not have their own financial resources or cannot access bank credit facilities."
"A more business-conducive environment for micro and craft enterprises should be supported through the promotion of high-quality support services, better legal and fiscal measures, and social protection for new entrepreneurs."
"More adequate and sustainable financial instruments should guarantee that SMEs have better access to capital."
"The Commission should redouble its efforts to remove red tape from existing EU support schemes and facilitate cross-border banking, by removing all existing obstacles to the usage of competing clearing and settlement systems and by applying common rules on trading."
"The Commission should conduct a comparative analysis of what is actually being made available to SMEs in the equity investment market and what their actual needs are."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which account for around 99% of all businesses in the EU and provide over 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment."
"However, the limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth, and the current financial and economic crisis has exacerbated this problem."
"The banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums, both requirements resulting in insufficient financing and missed business and employment opportunities in this particularly large sector of the economy."
"The availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes are crucial to exploiting the growth and job potential offered by SMEs."
"I agree that we must make every effort to ensure that existing financing facilities are effectively implemented both at national and EU levels, simplifying administrative procedures and making it easier to use the Structural Funds."
"in writing. - I have voted in favour of this resolution, as it highlights one of the crucial problems we are currently facing."
"The crisis in the financial sector has led to more collateral and higher-risk premiums, which means it has become much more difficult to get start-up credits and other financial resources."
"We cannot afford to have SMEs suffering from greater burdens and higher administrative costs."
"We cannot afford to have SMEs falling bankrupt because of bureaucracy and because of stricter rules in the financial sector."
"SMEs are the driving force of our economies - they should not be punished for mismanagement in the financial sector."
"It is important that we pass such resolutions frequently enough to remind ourselves, the Commission and the Member States of our obligations to ensure a sustainable economy."
"This is only possible with sustainable SMEs."
"in writing. - (DE) Support for small and medium-sized enterprises will safeguard numerous jobs and strengthen the innovation potential of the European economy."
"It is therefore absolutely right to ensure the reasonable provision of loan capital for these enterprises, as only then can they make the necessary investments."
"However, the increase in venture capital called for by the European Parliament is to be rejected on principle."
"Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit, Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets."
"With a motto of 'locusts for everyone', the motion for a resolution calls in places for private equity firms to make it easier to do business with them."
"This would turn smaller enterprises in particular into the pawns of investors to an even greater extent than they are now."
"These investors are very often on the look-out for absurdly high two-figure profits, which they can usually only achieve by carving up the acquired enterprises and selling them off bit by bit."
"Small and medium-sized European companies make a major contribution to economic growth in the European Union."
"There are 23 million SMEs, which corresponds to 99% of European companies."
"These numbers alone explain why we wish to and must protect these companies, which are the true driving force behind our economy."
"We have tried to send clear messages to the Commission with the motion for a resolution voted on today: these companies must not be abandoned."
"For these reasons, my vote in favour is part of our call for an increase in funding for SMEs, of our demand for less red tape and an adjustment to the standards required to obtain funding so that SMEs can really benefit from it, and also of our call for more funds for research."
"The economic crisis that has afflicted Europe in recent years must be overcome, and we can only hope to revitalise our economy by supporting these companies."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution which strongly supports the continued implementation of guarantee instruments in the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), the Risk-Sharing and Financing Facility under FP7 and the Structural Funds (JEREMIE), with the aim of enhancing SME lending, and under the JASMINE initiative to support micro-finance institutions; points out that their proper implementation is currently being hindered by overly complex administrative procedures; asks the Commission to make it easier to use the Structural Funds in connection with SME finance instruments, particularly to finance revolving funds for guarantee schemes, whilst avoiding the creation of structures which duplicate existing schemes, e.g. at national level."
"In the EU we have 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), equivalent to 99% of all companies and more than 100 million jobs."
"These make a crucial contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, provide an important source of innovation, and are vital for maintaining and expanding employment."
"However, they lack choice when it comes to accessing finance and this is a major obstacle to their creation and growth."
"The current financial and economic crisis is exacerbating the problem."
"In the light of the Europe 2020 Strategy, a significant increase in financing for innovative financial instruments in the EU budget is therefore crucial, in order to satisfy SMEs' financial requirements."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises make a fundamental contribution to growth and social cohesion and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment."
"However, SMEs' limited ability to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth, and the current financial crisis has exacerbated this problem."
"Banks are increasingly reluctant to finance riskier business projects, innovative products or business transfers."
"We therefore need to strengthen the functioning of SME finance schemes, support the continued implementation of guarantee instruments and increase funding for innovative financial instruments."
"Enterprises must have better access to equity-based financial instruments."
"The complexity of financial regulations and administrative burdens also restrict the development of SMEs, and it is therefore important to remove any administrative barriers and propose simplified and less costly regulations and guidelines."
"in writing. - This is the most useful resolution for the whole period from 2009 to 2011."
"I very much hope that the authors of the resolution will move forward and consider questions regarding the alleviation of the tax burden on small and medium-sized enterprises, will make available credit financing at reduced rates and improve communication between EU funding structures and SMEs, and finally monitor the situation in outlying regions of the EU, e.g. Latgale (Latvia)."
"The government is conducting the well-planned and calculated liquidation of SMEs in Latgale by closing access to information about stabilisation funds, and by increasing taxes and the number of controlling and repressively fiscal bodies."
"All this leads to the elimination of the tax base, and as a result Latvia is on the edge of bankruptcy today."
"in writing. - (DE) Small and medium-sized enterprises provide 100 million jobs in the EU."
"Following the crisis, however, these enterprises are increasingly faced with the problem of financing, as most of them are externally financed."
"Banks now only offer them credit under the strict conditions of a subsidised loan."
"It would be good to be able to provide solutions in this regard that involve as little bureaucracy as possible and that would meet the requirements of both sides."
"I voted in favour of the report, as SMEs should, in my view, be supported financially in order to keep the economy stable."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this draft motion for a resolution, because small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion, job creation and innovation."
"It is very important to establish effective instruments to support SME finance, paying particular attention to mezzanine financial instruments in the next programming period, which would remove obstacles to financing and would promote the creation and growth of new innovative enterprises, providing greater access to European venture capital and bond markets, while at the same time removing the barriers to the development of these markets."
"I agree with the proposal aiming to create better conditions for start-ups and innovative enterprises to have access to private equity."
"We must make every effort to ensure that existing financing facilities are effectively implemented both at national and EU levels, simplifying administrative procedures and making it easier to use the Structural Funds."
"It is very important for the Member States to implement fundamental reforms in SME taxation and support systems."
"There also needs to be increased funding from the EU budget for innovative financial instruments, with more funding being allocated to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme."
"Furthermore, administrative obstacles must be reduced for SMEs, streamlining management in connection with innovative financial instruments, coordinating SME financing programmes and creating a one-stop shop."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution to support SME finance during the next programming period."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises and family businesses form the backbone of most European economies."
"They are the workshops which produce innovative ideas and original products."
"They are also the undertakings that have always driven economic growth."
"In Greece in particular, this category of undertaking, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of business activity in Greece, is in need of support in the current recession."
"The European Parliament wishes to make clear in this motion for a resolution that the new generation of EU programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises must be predicated on the new situation in Europe, on facilitating access to borrowing by small and medium-sized enterprises and on creating flexible financing mechanisms, such as micro-finance."
"This motion for a resolution on the practical aspects of the revision of EU instruments to support finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the next programming period is essential in the current situation."
"In fact, the limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth."
"The current financial and economic crisis has exacerbated the problem of SMEs' access to finance."
"If we consider that SMEs contribute to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation; are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in increasing employment, we can understand the importance of the proposed amendments to this legal framework, which aim to improve the functioning of the SME finance schemes."
"For the above reasons, I voted for this resolution."
"in writing. - The European Parliament notes that a large number of SMEs will continue to depend mainly on credits and loans when it comes to external financing; it is concerned that an increasingly capital- and risk- sensitive banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums, both requirements resulting in insufficient financing and missed business and employment opportunities in this very large sector of the economy; it regards, therefore, the availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes as crucial to exploiting the growth and job potential offered by SMEs; it sees a need to leverage existing programmes at national and EU level and it endorses the important role played by EIB SME loans."
"I voted in favour of this text because I believe it can go some way to helping the more than 23 million European small and medium-sized enterprises, which make a crucial contribution to economic growth and social cohesion within the European Union through the 100 million jobs they provide."
"All too often in recent years, banks have demanded ever greater guarantees from SMEs needing capital to expand or revitalise their businesses."
"For this reason it is necessary to significantly increase the financial instruments that can help such businesses, and to encourage the implementation of instruments that allow, for example, risk sharing between the various stakeholders."
"The complexity of European Union financial regulations, moreover, often involves an enormous expenditure of time and money on red tape alone."
"Now we have agreed on the guidelines, it is up to Member States to adopt ad hoc measures to revitalise and support the specific situation of their own SMEs, fuelling growth in a sector that by itself represents over 90% of all enterprises in the Union and constitutes the very lifeblood of our economy."
"in writing. - (ET) Today I voted for the motion for a resolution supporting the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"I believe that the situation of SMEs and the use of the European Union's resources need to be made more effective so as to ensure that the liquidity crisis that occurred during the financial crisis, which had an impact on SMEs in particular, will not be repeated."
"Both in Estonia and in the European Union as a whole, SMEs constitute 99% of all businesses, which is why it is important that this particular majority should have access to financial backing, especially during difficult crisis years."
"I sincerely hope that both the European Union and SMEs will bring the European economy to a new ascent, and that in the future, we will be better prepared to face any new crisis."
"in writing. - (HU) I voted in favour of Amendment 6 of the proposal."
"I believe that start-ups and innovative enterprises must be supported in order to give them better access to equity-based financial instruments."
"The Commission should place stronger emphasis on programmes and financial instruments scheduled for the upcoming period, and on supporting these instruments with risk-sharing funds and facilities."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an essential element of economic growth and job creation in the European Union (EU): they account for more than 100 million jobs, and play a crucial role in contributing to social cohesion."
"However, these companies' access to financial credit and loans is limited, and the economic crisis has been exacerbating this situation, already made very complicated because of administrative burdens."
"I view an attempt to improve the way that SME finance systems work as broadly positive."
"I believe that such an attempt must include increasing the role of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in the loans scheme, as well as implementing the instruments that already exist within the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (Jeremie) programme and the Joint Action to Support Microfinance Institutions in Europe (Jasmine) programme."
"I also advocate simplifying SMEs' access to the Structural Funds, particularly as regards guarantee schemes, so as to prevent their duplication."
"It will also be advisable to consider new and effective financial instruments for the next multiannual financial framework, for example joint instruments with the EIB."
"in writing. - (LT) Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our society and the engine of our economy."
"Both in Lithuania and the EU SMEs account for 99% of all businesses."
"SMEs create more than 70% of jobs for Lithuanians."
"SMEs make a fundamental contribution to implementing the objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon, which promote innovations, competitiveness, social cohesion and job creation."
"It is therefore important to create an environment in which this can develop."
"SMEs, as well as start-ups and innovative enterprises must be given better access to the EU's financial instruments."
"The availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes is crucial to exploiting the growth and job potential offered by SMEs."
"Currently many investment plans risk not being implemented due to uncertainties and a lack of funding."
"It is therefore important for banks to upgrade liquidity provision and support investment in the real economy."
"It is also important to support equity markets for start-ups and innovative enterprises."
"We must try harder to remove administrative obstacles."
"This will require progressive management and economy linked to innovative financial instruments."
"in writing. - Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) constitute around 99% of all businesses within the European Union, contributing greatly to the European economy through innovation, economic growth and the creation of over 100 million jobs."
"My vote in favour of this report reflects the importance of enabling SMEs to function in a manner not over-complicated by regulations, but one which encourages efficiency, flexibility and investment."
"I recognise that advances have been made to ease the financial and administrative burden on SMEs, such as the 2010 establishment of the SMEs finance forum, but urge the Commission to do more in order to create a more competitive and accessible economy for the SMEs which are so vital to the success of Europe's economy."
"Incentives must encourage the necessary reforms to financial systems in Member States, investment must be made to nurture innovation in SMEs and administrative systems must work for, not against, these enterprises helping to create a more stable, more varied European economy."
"I welcome the results of today's vote."
"It is planned that approximately 70% of EU funds for entrepreneurs will be disbursed using the loan funds."
"Non-repayable grants will be reserved primarily for high-risk projects, which find it difficult to obtain loans."
"According to the experts, assistance provided in the form of a preferential loan or guarantee is better in the long term than non-reimbursable aid."
"Entrepreneurs benefit less from preferential loans."
"However, many more companies can benefit from these loans, and the money lending system, once supplied with money, should theoretically work indefinitely."
"I therefore subscribe to the idea that after 2014, 70-80% of support for entrepreneurs should be disbursed in the form of loans and guarantees, and the rest in non-repayable grants."
"The latter would be reserved for supporting innovative high-risk projects, or in other words those which would find it difficult to qualify for a loan."
"The future of the European public's pensions is one of the key challenges for the future of Europe and I acknowledge the difficulties that the Member States' pension systems are encountering."
"Nevertheless, I disagree that the only way to solve the problem is by paying more, working more and receiving less during retirement."
"I would also stress that it is the Member States that are mainly responsible for pensions."
"However, the European Union can add value by providing coordination between the various schemes and by sharing best practices, since it also has competence in the area of pension portability and supervising institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORP Directive)."
"I am only voting for this report because of the compromise based on more than 450 amendments, which include some of the main concerns regarding the White Paper."
"I would also caution that a decent and sustainable pensions system can only be achieved by combating an economy with jobs that are precarious, low paid and of a poor quality."
"Financed pensions must be based on solidarity and this must be taken into account in EU regulations."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this very important resolution on European pension systems."
"Europe is ageing and due to the worsening of the demographic situation and the declining birth rate, the number of people of retirement age is constantly rising."
"The importance of social security and pension funds is therefore undoubtedly increasing, particularly given the current economic crisis."
"People have to feel safe in their old age, and this can only be achieved with stable, well functioning pension systems."
"There are currently 100 different pension systems in the European Union."
"Due to major differences across the Member States, EU citizens feel unequal."
"People who have worked hard all their lives, particularly in the new EU Member States, receive different sized pensions compared to citizens in the old EU Member States."
"This makes them feel like second-class citizens."
"Undoubtedly, the regulation of pension systems is a Member State issue, but it is clear that there needs to be more European Union coordination in this area."
"The EU must care for those who need help most: the disabled, the unemployed and people of retirement age."
"In the interests of the welfare of its citizens and through the Member States, the European Union must try to level out pension systems."
"This would undoubtedly contribute to improving people's living standards and the EU's economic growth."
"In the European Union the number of pensioners is rising due to the increase in life expectancy."
"Pension systems come under Member States' remit, with different rules about the retirement age and the money spent on social security."
"The financial crisis has led to a rise in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, as well as to an increase in budget deficits and to problems relating to the funding of pensions."
"This has highlighted the fragility of certain financing schemes."
"The predominance of temporary jobs has reduced the level of contributions to pension systems, thereby adversely affecting their stability."
"The European Parliament's report and the European Commission's Green Paper seek to maintain pension systems which are adapted to citizens' needs without questioning the states' authority and suggesting that a single model would suit all."
"I think that solidarity between states and generations is an important factor in EU policies' success."
"There is coordination at EU level of aspects of the pension systems relating to the operation of the internal market, such as compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU 2020 Strategy."
"I voted for this report which encourages the efforts of Member States to meet the expectations of their citizens in terms of an adequate, sustainable and safe pension system."
"in writing. - (GA) The European population is ageing and it will not be long now until the age group '55 years old or older' will be the largest age group in the EU."
"Although there are four people of working age for every person over 65 at present, the ratio will be half that by the year 2050."
"I voted in favour of this timely report."
"Although it is the responsibility of the individual Member States to decide pension matters, the EU and the Member States must work together to develop a definite, sustainable and financially viable system."
"The workforce of today is especially mobile; therefore it is imperative that pensions can be transferred from one Member State to another."
"The pension systems must be brought up to date so that they are flexible, transparent and accessible."
"Information must be provided regarding the options available and the various aspects of different pension types."
"I support what is in the report about placing more emphasis on financial education and about encouraging awareness of saving for a pension."
"in writing. - (LT) The European Union faces enormous challenges, one of the most important of these being population ageing."
"Due to changing demographic trends, life expectancy is increasing, and older people remain healthy and active and participate in society for longer."
"At the same time due to the low birth rate, the number of people of working age will fall and therefore the Member States' social security systems will face great difficulties."
"The financial crisis has led to a growth in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, and has demonstrated the fragility of certain pension fund systems."
"There are rising budget deficits in many Member States and problems in the financing of pensions."
"Some private pension funds were also no longer able to meet their obligations, and therefore in future it is very important to properly regulate the activities and monitoring of such funds."
"I agreed with this report and believe that it is necessary to provide new incentives at national and EU levels to create strong, sustainable and safe European pension systems."
"The issue of the sustainability of social security systems has become an unavoidable subject on Europe's political agenda."
"Increased life expectancy, an ageing population, weak economic growth and increased unemployment are factors that have been contributed to an imbalance in social security systems."
"The current situation makes it necessary to take decisions that ensure the sustainability of social security regimes."
"I am voting for this report because it advocates the need to build a system together that is sustainable, safe, and that provides adequate pensions at Member State level."
"It recognises that freedom of movement in Europe is not confined to first-pillar provision, but that mobility is indispensable for an effective and efficient labour market."
"It advocates the creation of a European pensions platform involving representatives of EU institutions, social partners and relevant stakeholders, in order to exchange information about best practices and help to prepare policy initiatives, all in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"It calls on the European Commission to consider setting up a special task force on pensions."
"I voted for this report and concur with the rapporteur, who mentions in a clear and well-argued manner not only the need for intergenerational solidarity, but also the major differences between national pension systems in Europe."
"I agree that coordination is required at EU level, with the best arguments for this provided to us by the effects of the crisis, which we hope we have emerged from."
"The impact of public expenditure in a Member State is easy to pass on even to another Member State, whereas pension funds are part of the financial markets."
"I welcome the idea of a flexible labour market for pensioners, in view of the demographic changes we are going through and the obvious trend for extending working life."
"I agree with the idea that not only each Member State but also the Union as a whole must adapt their policies to the concept of active ageing."
"in writing. - (NL) The sustainability of our pension systems is a problem which has been passed around like a hot potato in Europe for far too long."
"The percentage of people who are retired is rising."
"In an effort to keep pensions at a sustainable level, the Member States have no choice but to reform their pension systems."
"This is directly linked to the sustainability of public finances and the rules for a healthy eurozone, the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I wholeheartedly support rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten when she highlights the importance of pension build-up via the employer (what is known as the second pillar) and individual pension build-up (the third pillar)."
"Unfortunately, we can no longer assume that the state pension (the first pillar) will be enough to sustain the level of lifestyle which workers have worked to achieve."
"The aspect of subsidiarity requires further elaboration."
"At the eurozone level, we need agreements by which Member States will guarantee that the reform of their pension systems will translate into sustainable public finances."
"Which choices are made as part of that process should, in my view, remain a matter for Member States alone."
"Questions such as women's participation in the labour market should be a matter for their social and labour market policy."
"Where people voluntarily choose part-time work, in order to better combine work, family and caring responsibilities, this should not be discouraged by Europe."
"Although Member States remain fully responsible for the choice and organisation of their pension systems, the fact remains that European economies have become interdependent and that economic governance discussions also focus on the viability and sustainability of pension systems."
"Therefore the EU has a coordinating role to play."
"The rapporteur has gone to great lengths to obtain a compromise; this text contained some good points, not least the idea that pension systems should guarantee all citizens a decent standard of living, that diversity should be respected, that inequalities between men and women are unacceptable and unjustifiable, that a life course approach should be taken and that older workers should be rehabilitated."
"However, at the same time, by trying too hard to compromise, we have arrived at a text that is unclear in places and too open to interpretation."
"In addition, there are still certain ideas that I cannot subscribe to, such as calling upon the Member States to improve citizens' access to private savings schemes and encouraging work by older people through fiscal and social security exemption measures."
"For these reasons I abstained from the final vote."
"Demographic development, that is, the inverted population pyramid that we can expect in due course, and longer life expectancy, which means that older people remain in work and participate in society for longer, make it necessary to consider social welfare systems."
"The financial and economic crisis, combined with demographic changes, has had an impact on pension systems."
"Because of higher unemployment, slower growth, smaller returns on investments and larger public deficits, it is more difficult for pension systems to provide adequate pensions."
"In particular, young people with a high level of education are entering the labour market later, and so they do not work long enough to claim a pension when they reach the legal retirement age."
"It should also be borne in mind that inadequate pensions may lead to a decline in consumption and, because of reduced demand, to economic instability in a country."
"As a result, I feel that steps really must be taken to redefine the future of young and old, thus contributing to secure and adequate income provision after retirement, while the need to give fresh impetus to the responsibilities of Member States, the two sides of industry and Europe must also be kept in mind."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because given the rapid ageing of Europe's populations, it is necessary to devote particular attention to the age of retirement, to ensuring the security of pension saving funds and strengthening common minimum pension standards, in order to guarantee normal living conditions for all of Europe's older people."
"Although setting the retirement age and the size of pensions is the responsibility of the Member States themselves, the European Parliament and the Commission are proposing measures that would help to overcome the threats to pension systems."
"Furthermore, a certain amount of coordination of the reforms of national pension systems is unavoidable as we establish the internal market and implement the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"It is unfortunate that the Commission's Green Paper scarcely pays any attention to gender equality."
"Women have atypical contracts more often than men, or take precarious jobs, and therefore they earn less on average."
"Furthermore, women interrupt their careers more often due to motherhood and to care for children and elderly or disabled family members, and they therefore lose insurance guarantees and ultimately receive smaller pensions."
"It should be recognised that there is no such thing as a perfect pension system."
"Economic and financial capabilities vary across the Member States, therefore more attention needs to be paid to the means of improving pension systems, such as timing the start of working life, 'flexible' assessment of retirement age, better reconciliation of work and family life, and the general criteria for setting a minimum pension."
"Public pay-as-you-go systems operating in some Member States are facing big increases in costs, which means growing pressure on solidarity and a heavier burden for the younger generation."
"The year 2060 may seem far away, but this does not change the predictions at all: an increasingly ageing population, a low birth rate, and therefore huge pressure on budgets."
"Each of the Member States is obviously directly responsible for establishing their own pension systems."
"Indeed, this power is irrefutable and there is no suggestion that a single model would suit all."
"However, it is important to call for adequate, sustainable and safe pensions at a time when Europe will be facing a demographic disaster in a few decades, the early signs of which have already started to show."
"Raising the pension age is one of the relevant solutions when discussing the fact that states are no longer going to have a working population of sufficient size to pay for the pensions of those who have left the labour market."
"Indeed, a gradual increase in the retirement age is a natural solution in these circumstances, which is supported by the fact that life expectancy is much higher than 40 years ago."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on bringing such a relevant and sensitive subject to the attention of Parliament."
"It is true that the financial and economic crisis and demographic change, with the increase in life expectancy, have prompted all Member States to strengthen their pension policies."
"These measures therefore prompt a drive to modernise and coordinate national policies on the adjustment of pension systems, sustainability, balance between the duration of working life and pensions, greater transparency of pension systems and protection of solvency."
"I agree, in particular, with the attention paid by the rapporteur to female workers, who are often discriminated against with regard to male workers where pensions are concerned."
"I also agree with the need to prolong workers' careers through a modern employment policy and improvement of working conditions, and I agree with the need to make pension systems and the information provided to citizens more transparent."
"I am very concerned, however, about the serious impact that the measures called for in this document may have on the Member States' coffers, many of which are already under great pressure as a result of the tough economic crisis."
"I welcome the adoption by the European Parliament of this report inviting the EU Member States to establish adequate, sustainable and safe pension systems."
"It reaffirms the main aim of pensions: to guarantee social cohesion in a spirit of equity between generations."
"In a context of demographic change and economic crisis, pensions must remain a fundamental part of our social pact."
"Nevertheless, I wish to make it clear that each Member State is free to organise its own pension system and that the European Union is there to simply facilitate coordination between the States."
"The economic and financial crisis has greatly added to the demographic challenge facing the EU, and has led to a growth in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion."
"The goal of a 75% employment rate laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy should help secure the sustainability of pension systems, as it is linked with higher levels of employment, greater productivity and economic growth."
"The holistic approach adopted by the Green Paper intends to impart fresh impetus, both at national and EU level, with the objective of establishing pension systems that are robust, suitable for the long-term, sustainable and safe."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of the main sources of employment in the EU and make a significant contribution to the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems in Member States."
"I call for the development of sectoral, intersectoral and/or territorial funds to increase affiliation of workers in SMEs to pension systems."
"I voted against the report on the Green Paper on European pension systems."
"The report clearly promotes the harmonised, anti-social policies of the European Union and the reduction of social rights to the lowest common liberal denominator."
"The text makes provision for an increase in the retirement age of European workers and for retirement ages to be linked to life expectancy."
"European workers, having paid to rescue the banks and been subjected to exhausting austerity measures, are again being forced to pay for the consequences of the crisis, a crisis which they did not cause, by working longer years for a smaller pension."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left moved an alternative resolution, which was, unfortunately, not accepted, against the Green Paper on pensions and highlighted the potential for improving pensions and retirement ages for the benefit of the workers."
"This can be done without increasing the age limit, through increased labour rights, especially for young people, better pay and, at the same time, higher taxation on financial capital and financial transactions."
"Although the responsibility for paying pensions falls to the Member States, it is, nonetheless, important for there to be coordination at European level on certain issues."
"I am aware of the disparities between pension systems in Europe."
"However, there is a clear need for a strategy to be created that increases cohesion and coherence on pensions, with full respect for the subsidiarity and solidarity principles."
"This strategy must take into consideration the current economic and demographic situation, but also the completion of the internal market."
"We must therefore not forget that freedom of movement within Europe is a fundamental right of European citizens, which entails the mobility of individuals and namely of workers who must be able to benefit from an effective and efficient labour market, as well as from the guarantee that they will have access to a sustainable, secure and adequate income after retirement."
"It is also important to provide the public with adequate and continuous information about their rights regarding the pension system, especially as regards systems relating to cross-border activities and mobility."
"I voted for the resolution for which I was appointed rapporteur on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I find the final text of the resolution balanced, emphasising both the importance of the public pension pillar and the need for a proper second pillar in all Member States."
"An idea which I tried to suggest was to define a minimum EU-level pension, which will guarantee a secure, decent income for European citizens."
"Unfortunately, it did not receive sufficient positive feedback from among my fellow Members."
"However, I hope that in future the Commission will come up with this kind of proposal."
"in writing. - (RO) I feel it is beneficial that the Europe 2020 Strategy supports an active, focused labour market policy, which will help increase the employment rate of older workers, women, members of minority groups and the long-term unemployed."
"By achieving this objective, I believe that Europe will see an increase in the number of people in work and, by extension, economic growth, which will have a positive impact on the viability of pension systems at EU level."
"in writing. - (NL) I today voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report on pensions."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on this report, I have had the opportunity to work constructively with the rapporteur."
"The IMCO opinion has largely been reproduced in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report."
"I believe that the report is measured and balanced and that at its heart is the notion that, for Member States, pensions should be subject to subsidiarity."
"This will ensure adequate protection of the Dutch pillar system."
"However, what I absolutely cannot support are elements in the report which appear to call for binding European agreements on Member States' pension systems."
"That is at odds with everything the Belgian Socialist Party stands for."
"I voted in favour of the proposed text because pensions are one of the fundamental institutions of the system of worker's rights and duties."
"They are essential for the continuation of a decent standard of living for the people concerned and for their whole families, especially when it comes to receiving adequate support so as to attain a decent standard of personal and family life."
"By setting this threshold as a long-term goal, it is obvious that sustainable pension systems are necessary to offer certain minimum prospects to workers."
"While I respect the principle of bottom-up subsidiarity, with primary authority and responsibility for adequacy and opportunity for reform lying with the Member States, there is a need for convergence of pension systems in Europe, so as to ensure full and genuine freedom of movement for workers and enterprises and also full and mutual recognition and parity of the various pension systems within the Member States."
"Indeed, while I acknowledge the differences in the cost of living and in wage levels between Member States, there is a need to establish long-term convergence both internally within each Member State and within the EU as a whole, so as to promote a decent and adequate level of life expectancy."
"I voted for this report because I think that pension systems throughout the whole European Union are already facing major sustainability problems, which are likely to get even worse in the future, thereby requiring a rethink."
"However, the review done by each Member State must be carried out in compliance with the fundamental scope of providing a decent income at a reasonable cost for elderly people after they have contributed for a lifetime."
"Reducing pension levels below the subsistence limit, which has been done in some Member States, is inhumane and must be avoided."
"The most glaring example of exploitation is Romania, where the current government has decided that all pensions should be cut drastically and taxed, along with a levy for health care insurance."
"Under the guise of subsidiarity, the Romanian Government probably wants to create an ingenious pension system by making pensioners physically disappear through depriving them of minimum financial resources and medical assistance."
"I think that one of the EU's goals in this area must be to curb the excesses of governments in certain Member States against pensioners."
"I voted for this report because I advocate the need for the EU and the Member States to coordinate their various policies on pensions in a more effective way, and to guarantee the adequacy, safety and sustainability of pension systems for women and men."
"It is essential to separate pension entitlements according to gender, and to set specific criteria to be used in calculating women's pensions in such a way as to guarantee the economic independence of both men and women."
"With regard to paragraph 6, we Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote in favour of the removal of the reference to the inclusion of direct pension liabilities in public debt and deficit calculations."
"The reason for this is that we feel there a risk that a link like this between pension liabilities and debt deficit calculations could, in the short term, have a number of undesirable and disproportionate consequences in certain Member States."
"However, in the longer term, we believe that each Member State should establish procedures that will result in public pension liabilities being accurately reflected in relevant debt and deficit forecasts."
"Increased average life expectancy and the inversion of the population pyramid in Europe present significant challenges for a society that is ageing, and will have to ensure adequate living conditions for its older people and a role that, in many cases, can and should be active."
"However, faced with the real threat of the collapse in traditional pension systems, the Member States must, bravely and head-on, adopt the necessary measures to save their social security systems, which do not just involve raising the retirement age."
"However, emphasis must be placed immediately on modernisation, with the possibility of mixed models."
"This will ensure that those entering the system now can freely choose which model they want to protect them in their old age."
"The current crisis has highlighted a problem which, it became apparent, was serious: the bankruptcy of the social security systems."
"In truth, the proximity of the reversal of the age pyramid - as a result of demographic changes caused by the population's increased longevity - is threatening the financial sustainability of the pension schemes."
"On the one hand, the number of unemployed is increasing; on the other, more funds are being expended on pension payments."
"Moreover, young people are entering the labour market increasingly later, and so are not taking part in the contributory system."
"Since we do not want 'old age' to become synonymous with poverty, we must create a guaranteed minimum pension that grants quality of life to the elderly."
"Such a measure will help to eradicate poverty and enable older people to live in dignity."
"All these problems are reflected in the European Commission's Green Paper on pensions."
"What is now needed is a series of policies coordinated at EU level."
"I therefore express my full agreement with this report's conclusions, and welcome the initiatives aimed at intergenerational solidarity that will allow all pensioners a sustainable and dignified income."
"We find it regrettable that the alternative motion for a resolution that we tabled has not been adopted."
"The majority of the Members of the European Parliament, including those of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, therefore took the side of the antisocial policies that the Commission and Council are implementing, so legitimising the neoliberal path that they are following and wish to develop."
"In doing so, they have forgotten the workers in various European Union countries who have been struggling against the rise in the legal retirement age, fighting to safeguard a caring and universal social security system; a system that values the smaller pensions, and respects the elderly, enabling them to live in dignity, whilst contributing to the eradication of poverty."
"As the alternative resolution that we tabled says, it is possible to improve pensions without increasing the legal retirement age, provided that there are more jobs with rights, particularly for young people, better salaries and more taxation of financial transactions."
"For example, recent studies show that a general tax of 0.1% on financial transactions in European Union Member States could provide an increase in annual revenue of around 2.1% of gross domestic product, or almost EUR 262 billion."
"There are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU at present."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises comprise 99% of all EU enterprises, and are responsible for 100 million jobs in the Union."
"It is very clear that the issue of the cost and unavailability of credit is the biggest problem for the small and medium-sized enterprises sector at present."
"Many viable enterprises still have difficulty accessing credit at a reasonable rate from the banks."
"Considering the amount of support received by the banking sector from the Irish taxpayer, this is incredible and unacceptable."
"Other costs such as rents, utility bills and local charges also hamper the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in the present difficult times."
"I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report on adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems."
"The report is full of good intentions, but just like the Commission's Green Paper, it leaves us with doubts about the true political goals of this debate."
"I cannot help but think that the latter's fundamental aim is to prepare public opinion for the gradual privatisation of pension schemes."
"After seeing the losses recorded by private pension funds in Europe and the United States during the financial crisis, I prefer to stick with the intergenerational solidarity of pay-as-you-go schemes."
"Despite the constant references to the principle of subsidiarity, it is very much a case here of laying the foundations for the harmonisation of pension systems in the European Union, if not in terms of the level of pensions, then at least in terms of their structure."
"How can we believe, in your ultraliberal and internationalist Europe, that such harmonisation can be anything other than an encouragement to take out individual insurance with private companies?"
"A potential market of hundreds of billions of euros."
"At the same time, pensions paid under the first pillar - public, compulsory and pay-as-you-go pensions - will be whittled away as a result of the Stability and Growth Pact, and tomorrow as a result of Mrs Merkel's pact."
"The occupational pension funds that one would like to see developed are still pension funds, and we know what part they played in the global financial meltdown."
"We also know what they are good for during a financial crisis: ruining savers."
"One cannot but worry about the pathetic prudential regulations to which they are subject, even in Europe."
"The social security system as a whole, and the pension system in particular, is the responsibility of the Member States alone."
"The problem that needs to be resolved is not just financial, it is demographic, too."
"The European Union, which has a serious responsibility where these matters are concerned, is by no means the appropriate level at which to address them."
"With regard to the report on pension systems in Europe, this is a very sensitive subject."
"Although some truly positive elements can be found in this text, it would be totally unacceptable for the mechanism of old-age insurance to be considered through the prism of budgetary constraints, with capital-based pensions encouraged as a result."
"Being in favour of intergenerational solidarity, I could not vote in favour of a report that would be liable to promote the development of capital-based pension systems."
"I abstained during the vote on this text."
"It contains many very positive points, but unfortunately it also contains certain ideas to which I am opposed."
"Removing the obstacles to workers' mobility by making pensions portable, respecting the diversity of national pension systems, reducing gender inequalities and the unacceptable gaps that exist between men and women with regard to employment and retirement provision, including older workers in the labour market, providing greater redundancy protection for older workers, and so on, are all recommendations that are made in this report and which I very much welcome."
"Nevertheless, other points have led me to abstain."
"They include, for example, the fact that the report calls for private savings schemes to be encouraged."
"in writing. - (DE) Demographic change towards an increasingly older society in conjunction with the setbacks in the areas of economic growth, state finances and the financial markets caused by the economic and financial crisis make it necessary to adapt our practices with regard to pensions."
"This adaptation is in keeping with the completion of the European internal market and the Europe 2020 goals for employment and the long-term sustainability of public finances."
"However, I welcome this proposal above all because it provides for more efficient pension provision that is to be both sustainable and safe."
"I am firmly convinced that pension provision should not only enable older EU citizens to live in dignity, but it should also be a reward for their working life as a whole."
"If we want the European citizens of tomorrow to be motivated in their work and to be open to cross-border activities, it is important, even today, to offer them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pension provision, harmonised at European level."
"Nonetheless, the responsibility for pension provision remains with the Member States, meaning that pension systems primarily fall within the competence of the Member States and therefore the only thing that should be provided by Europe is coordinated guidance for Member States."
"In this regard, the principle of solidarity between the generations and that of national solidarity ought to be taken into consideration in particular."
"In addition, with regard to subsidiarity, all pension systems should remain 'exportable' for citizens."
"in writing. - (FR) Although this text has positive aspects, particularly the importance given to promoting employment to ensure the sustainability of pensions systems or the position of the social partners, other aspects seemed to me difficult to support, which is why I abstained on this text."
"The deletion of paragraph 24 on the link between life expectancy and the retirement age is, however, a major victory for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, who thus wished to defend the European social model, contrary to what this measure advocated."
"In fact, the life expectancy of certain social categories is diminishing as a result of their working conditions and the difficulties they encounter when trying to access preventive and medical care."
"We have to ensure that all European citizens can live out their retirement with dignity."
"in writing. - Labour MEPs voted in favour of this non-binding report on pensions and the challenges of ageing societies and spending pressures being faced across the EU."
"We welcome the fact that this report explicitly states that there is no 'one size fits all' approach to pension provision across Member States but that the EU can clearly add value in sharing ideas and coordination."
"We voted to remove from paragraph 8 the inclusion of private debt in the sustainability assessment of public finances, as we feel that current market conditions would not be supported by this kind of assessment."
"We also maintain concerns over the issue of applying Solvency II-type capital requirements to pensions as this could potentially drive up costs without adding security for the UK's employer-sponsored occupational pensions."
"The UK's system, including the Pension Protection Funds set up under the Labour Government, provides a high level of protection to pension scheme members and beneficiaries."
"Labour MEPS will continue to work to ensure that people who save with the State, with their employer or privately are given the genuine pension protection they need to feel safe about their retirement."
"in writing. - (LT) Demographic trends, in other words, the inverted population pyramid which we can expect in due course and the longer life expectancy, which we have the good fortune to enjoy, in which context older people remain healthy and active and participate in society for longer, make it necessary to consider a strategy for fresh cohesion and coherence in the field of pensions."
"There are major disparities between pension systems in Europe, and new Member States and their citizens face extra problems because it is so desirable to establish a diversified pension system (with several pillars), in order to spread risks."
"The financial and economic crisis has shown that no pension system is immune to such events but that large budget deficits, high unemployment and very limited scope for increasing the burden of taxation and other levies particularly hit pay-as-you-go systems, and some Member States, such as Lithuania, even had to take drastic measures, that is, reduce pensions, which in my opinion is intolerable and unacceptable."
"The Member States must make every possible effort and preclude such reduction measures, which are painful for the poorest people."
"I abstained on this report, because many of the decisions proposed are socially sensitive and there is also insufficient evaluation of the benefits and risks in the report, particularly when we are talking about increasing the retirement age or Member States losing influence in pension policy."
"in writing. - (DE) I abstained from voting on the European Parliament report on a European pension system."
"Although it is, in principle, to be welcomed that the European Union is considering how it can support the efforts of Member States to provide adequate pensions, pensions policy is, and remains, the task of the relevant Member States, in respect of which the EU should only take action with the utmost sensitivity and with consideration for national circumstances."
"However, the decisions in question are not favourable for the German occupational pension model in particular."
"In my opinion, regulations jeopardising occupational pension systems that have been successfully implemented in many European countries should not be enacted at European level."
"Considerable improvements are still needed in this regard."
"in writing. - (LV) I supported the report on the creation of adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems, since I believe that changes to the existing pensions model are essential to secure its sustainability."
"Currently, European countries run the risk that future generations will not be able to draw pensions capable of providing a decent old age."
"We must admit that at present we are living at the expense of future generations."
"We borrow in order to pay today's pensions."
"This must change."
"The pensions system must be balanced in such a way that current revenues can cover current expenditure."
"Any other solution would mean living beyond our means."
"This can be done in various ways, but we must also admit that we can no longer rely on drawing a pension soon after we reach the age of 60."
"Retirement age must be raised in stages throughout Europe, and it must approach the 70 years of age threshold."
"That is one of the ways to ensure that the social security budget does not become a burden on European countries' economies."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report is based on the Commission Green Paper submitted in July 2010 and on the issues that this Institution has raised for debate with regard to the adequacy and sustainability of European pension systems."
"This paper serves as a precursor to the future White Paper containing a general analysis of the 27 Member States and a projection of the guidelines that the EU is laying down for its members, from which an effective response is expected."
"My reaction upon reading the report was positive, which is why I voted in favour of it."
"This draft is certainly too conservative considering what needs to be done."
"However, we can describe it as a good starting point, since it provides an overview of the pension system enlarged to 27 States."
"The establishment of a European pensions platform could be a perfect opportunity to open a debate between the EU Institutions and social partners concerned."
"The ultimate goal is to adapt pension systems and place them in the context of the demographic and economic variables our world is subject to."
"I voted against this report, as it advocates capital-based pension schemes to the detriment of pay-as-you-go public pension schemes, and increasing the retirement age."
"It also advocates an approach that would create further insecurity for older workers by encouraging 'flexible' pensions, combining work with retirement."
"It was with great satisfaction that I took note of the result of today's vote on Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report on the subject of adequate, stable and secure pension systems in Europe."
"I believe that pensions should be secure and stable, especially nowadays in the context of an ageing European population and the financial crisis."
"Current statistics provide a clear signal that the problem is getting worse and that demographic changes in Europe are unequivocal."
"Experts have shown that at present in the EU four people are working to support one pensioner, but in about 50 years' time there will only be two."
"It is clear therefore that further work on the pension system is needed and further reforms are essential."
"This is why we must strive for increased international activity by the Member States to ensure that the coordination of pension systems will be effective and efficient."
"In addition, in accepting the report, the European Parliament is stating clearly that there can be no room for discrimination on the grounds of age or gender, which is particularly significant in the context of the social debate on equality of men and women in the workplace."
"To work for months on the sustainability of pension systems in Europe, to draw up an ambitious report, to negotiate compromises for hours without wishing to state the obvious, which is that many European Union governments have engaged in reforms of pension systems, giving priority to extending the contribution period, is, for me, an act of the utmost levity."
"The denial of reality is an act of gross negligence."
"The European Parliament is not tackling the core issue, because it is divisive!"
"I disapprove of this way of doing politics: instead of seeking unanimity at all costs, the European Parliament has fundamentally chosen the wrong method."
"It has a duty to explore coherent and courageous courses of action."
"That is what our citizens expect when pension systems, which are the real prizes of the European social model, are in danger."
"I am therefore unable to support a report that has turned into a vain exercise, since it fails to take account of the reality of the situation."
"in writing. - (NL) The delegation of the Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the European Parliament today voted against the initiative report on the Green Paper on European pensions, because it contained several ambiguities and inaccuracies."
"We support a number of improvements, such as the encouragement of a good combination of state and occupational pension schemes in Member States and a European tracking system for increased job mobility, so that every citizen knows what they can expect from their pension and make their own choices."
"However, rising unemployment, problems in the financial markets, high national debt and slow economic growth could lead to difficulties in terms of Member States' pension payment obligations, with repercussions on the Stability and Growth Pact and therefore the stability of the euro."
"In addition, the increasingly ageing population is having a major impact in many Member States, because they do not save as much as the Dutch."
"We therefore need harmonised supervision of pension systems, and some Member States ought to organise their pension systems differently."
"We do not, however, want any tampering whatsoever with the Dutch pension system."
"In order to guard against this, despite voting in favour of a number of good points in the report, we remain against the report as a whole."
"The VVD Group in the European Parliament: Hans van Baalen, Jan Mulder and Toine Manders."
"in writing. - I voted for this Report which makes it clear at the beginning (Paragraph 1) and the end (Paragraph 61) that the main responsibility for pensions rests through the subsidiarity principle with the Member States, the EU contribution being to provide coordination where possible and the sharing of best practice."
"This report irresponsibly advocates increasing the legal age of retirement while hypocritically suggesting that a 'social and civic dialogue' on the subject takes place and that the result is duly taken into account."
"The necessary referendum is, unfortunately, a long way off."
"As expected, it is also an ode to the privatisation of the pay-as-you-go pension system, which we all know to be effective."
"Retirement transformed into a financial product on the internal market of pension funds, with free and fair competition - that is what this report proposes."
"I am voting against, and absolutely condemn, this text."
"The serious problem of demographic trends, in other words, the reversal of the age pyramid which we can expect in due course, as well as longer life expectancy, in which context older people remain healthy and active and participate in society for longer, make it necessary to consider a strategy to increase cohesion and coherence in the field of pensions."
"This new reality makes it necessary to take initiatives which redefine the future of young and old, as well as solidarity between generations and people, thus contributing to a sustainable, secure and adequate income after retirement."
"in writing. - (ES) I have voted against this motion for a resolution as I consider it to be an unacceptable attack on workers' rights, as it advocates an increase in pension contribution years, the raising of the retirement age and the progressive privatisation of the public pension systems."
"I believe that these types of measures are aimed at establishing pension systems that benefit the interests of the financial sector and they do not represent a move towards public pensions systems that are more fair, sustainable, secure and beneficial to European citizens."
"As such, I am opposed to the progressive construction of an anti-social Europe, governed by the markets and financial powers, which have submerged us in this crisis by their ambition and excessive greed, which will be incomprehensibly compensated through the privatisation of public pension systems."
"Furthermore, I consider it unacceptable that the resolution which, while emphasising the importance of granting a relevant role to social dialogue in pension reforms, defends antisocial measures, such as the raising of the retirement age, which have been rejected by the majority of Europeans through massive general strikes."
"According to László Andor, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, the number of retired people will double by 2060 in relation to the active population able to finance pensions."
"It is therefore urgent to give thought to the future of pension systems."
"Although it falls within the competence of the Member States, this issue must not prevent the European Union from assisting Member States in their deliberations in order to guarantee European citizens an adequate, stable and sustainable pension system."
"To be able to have an adequate and appropriate pension in a Member State of the EU is the necessary complement to the principle of the free movement of people."
"The economic and monetary crisis demonstrates the need for an integrated approach, encompassing the demographic and social aspects as well as the economic and financial aspects."
"in writing. - I hope that Parliament will not confine itself simply to producing reports and votes."
"It is necessary to analyse all 27 pension systems in the EU."
"I am confident that violations of the rules on a massive scale will be revealed in this sphere in Latvia, where the Government constantly tries to solve the budget deficit problem at the expense of pensions."
"As a result, pensioners in Latvia have become hostages to the current Government's risk-taking activities."
"In the majority of cases, pensions in Latvia are below the official minimum subsistence level."
"The situation is complicated by the Government's decision to retain payments to the second pension tier."
"This can have very sad consequences."
"I voted in favour in the hope of an independent assessment of the situation in Latvia."
"in writing. - (DE) Within the European Union we are still seeing a considerable decline in prosperity, which will certainly be evident with the loss of the periods of protection for the labour market."
"Every country is having to grapple with the demographic changes and the associated lack of financial viability of its pension systems."
"Private pensions, which were to provide additional support, have not brought the much talked about relief to the pension systems but have instead placed state pensions under even more pressure."
"Against this background, the people in Hungary, for example, have almost been forced to go back to the state system."
"In this regard, the unfulfillable promises of returns by pension funds are also problematic, as revealed during the course of the economic and financial crisis."
"Interference like that at EU level often brings with it a whole series of problems, for example in connection with the compensatory allowance for pensions, which opened the floodgates to abuse."
"The details of pensions are regulated differently in the individual States and they must also remain that way, which is why I strongly reject the report."
"I wanted to express my support for the Oomen-Ruijten report on future pension systems in Europe, since it clearly illustrates a principle on which European actions and initiatives should always be based: the principle of subsidiarity."
"In an effort to respond to a real need, that is, to a new assessment of European pension systems in the wake of changed demographic, economic and social conditions, it has been decided that individual Member States will be given the flexibility to act within the framework of a general European guide."
"The situations and conditions in the various countries are too diverse for us to conceive of drawing up common binding rules, and so the decision to respect the essential principle of subsidiarity was a good one."
"in writing. - (DE) Before long the population pyramid will be turned on its head in the EU: the over 55s will represent the largest proportion of the population, life expectancy will continue to increase, the birth rate will remain low and young people will start their working lives ever later."
"We are all aware of the consequences of this: an overageing population and ever more bottlenecks when it comes to the financing of pensions."
"What we actually need, in particular, is a more family-friendly policy in the Member States - I am thinking for example of the introduction of family tax splitting into income tax law."
"The contribution of families to safeguarding the intergenerational contract should be taken into account in social legislation by means of a gradual reduction in social insurance contributions."
"These aspects are not, or are insufficiently, taken into account in the report."
"However, the much lauded mass immigration is the wrong way to go about safeguarding our pensions."
"At the end of the day, pensions policy should remain within the sphere of competence of the Member States. Therefore, I have voted against this report."
"in writing. - (PL) In today's vote I supported the acceptance of the report on stable and secure pension systems in Europe."
"The issue of pensions in the future is a problem not only in Poland but all over the European Union."
"In the report, the European Parliament confirmed that in matters concerning pensions systems, the Member State is responsible for the organisation of its national pension system."
"However, EU institutions will support the activities of the Member States on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity."
"For me, a very important issue is that attention has been focussed on discrimination against women in the context of pension systems, and we need to overcome this."
"At the same time, current demographic changes which are leading to an ageing population are causing problems in establishing a stable pension."
"The number of pensioners continues to increase, while we have falling numbers of people active on the labour market."
"Another important issue is the problem of young people who are unable to find employment due to the situation on the labour market."
"In this regard it is essential that more people should be employed and should remain employed for as long as possible."
"I voted for Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report because I believe that trying to lay the foundations for a goal as important as that of a common European pension system, while having due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, is a big step towards true socio-political integration."
"The legislative framework is certainly complex, but the European Commission White Paper on pension systems already indicates which way the Union is heading."
"The report specifically aims to establish adequate, sustainable and safe criteria, calling on Member States to debate the subject, to publicise the proposals formulated and to work together to produce a true joint plan through the Open Method of Coordination."
"We are discussing the economic governance package at EU level in order to reform the Stability and Growth Pact and to establish common rules."
"No State can get away from pension reform if it wishes to put its finances in order."
"For this reason, I think it makes sense to have common rules in this area too, because it would make monitoring and implementation of the SGP much easier."
"This report on adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems represents an important step in implementing a coordination policy in the European Union."
"In fact, although this falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States, the pension system is directly linked to the financial market, as well as being one of the areas covered by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is becoming necessary, for demographic reasons of which we are all aware, to consider a strategy that increases cohesion and coherence on pensions."
"We must create initiatives which redefine the future of young and old, and solidarity between generations and people, thus contributing to a sustainable, secure and adequate income after retirement."
"There are marked differences between the various pension schemes in Europe, but it is important to create a common platform by clearly defining the division of responsibilities."
"In this way, it will be possible to create a sustainable and safe system together; a modern system which recognises freedom of movement in Europe, which is based on the assumption that mobility is essential, particularly for the younger generations and, of course, for an effective and efficient labour market."
"For all these reasons, I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (RO) In November 2009 Romania had 5.54 million pensioners and 5.65 million contributors to the public pension system."
"Providing EU citizens with an adequate, sustainable pension, now and in the future, is a priority for the European Union."
"Achieving these objectives in an ageing Europe is a major challenge and Member States must prepare for this by reforming their pension systems."
"Member States must improve the adequacy of pensions by combating gender discrimination on the labour market, especially through a 10% reduction in the pay gap by 2020."
"The public pension system must be strengthened to the detriment of the private system."
"We must not privatise the public pension system simply to ensure the stability of pension funds for current and future pensioners."
"Although the trend at European level is to raise the retirement age, it should be applied flexibly according to the sector and the severity of the working conditions, while also taking into account the number of years' service."
"Active support is required for job creation."
"The quality of work also needs to be improved in order to increase the number of people who will actively contribute to funding their future pensions."
"Making pension systems sustainable is one of the major challenges facing the political class if it wishes to maintain the common good and social peace."
"Although European competences are limited in this regard, it was also important or the European Parliament to give its opinion as a follow-up to the Green Paper issued by the Commission."
"That has been done with the adoption of the very comprehensive Oomen-Ruijten report, which confirms the need to reform pension systems due to the unfavourable trend in the ratio of the number of people aged over 65 to the working population."
"Moreover, the resolution is in line with the recent Eurobarometer survey, showing the wisdom and maturity of European citizens, 73% of whom take the view 'that they will have to work longer or save more for their old age'."
"The predominant idea of prolonging working life beyond the age of 65 has, admittedly, met with mixed reactions among the general public."
"However, this may be a blessing in disguise, as other levers will necessarily have to be activated."
"In the case of my country, Belgium, alone, where the rate of employment among older workers is one of the lowest in the European Union, there is an urgent need to encourage Belgian workers to remain longer in the labour market."
"Today Parliament voted on the report entitled 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems'."
"The Commission, taking account of demographic trends and the effects of the economic and financial crisis, has decided that in order to modernise pension policies it is necessary to take coordinated action on: adjustment of pension systems, sustainability, balance between the duration of working life and duration of pensions, removal of obstacles to mobility, greater transparency of pension systems and protection of solvency."
"In this report we wish to acknowledge and maintain individual responsibilities in order to create a sustainable and safe system that is capable of ensuring an adequate pension at Member State level."
"A modern system that acknowledges, in particular, the new generation's need for mobility and offers solutions not only for the present but also for the near future."
"in writing. - (ES) Despite the fact that the vote has allowed the incorporation of some crucial elements of the social conscience, there remained some unfortunate aspects that led me to abstain in the final vote."
"This is the case, for example, in the part of paragraph 21 where it is asked that Member States improve access for citizens to private saving schemes."
"European pension systems are in an increasingly alarming state."
"We must act now to ensure that men and women have equal opportunities, safeguarding those who decide to retire today and, at the same time, protecting those who are only now taking their first steps in the labour market."
"In Europe, women still earn on average 18% less than men."
"The main effect of this wage disparity is apparent at retirement age: because they have earned less throughout their working lives, women also have lower pensions."
"As a result, women are more affected than men by persistent poverty."
"Especially in times of crisis, we need to include the gender perspective in all policies, adopting national measures that are agreed on and coordinated at European level."
"I voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report, because I think it is a good compromise that can support the dialogue between Member States and European Institutions on the modernisation of pension systems."
"We support the report on the Green Paper 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems', as the European Commission aims to assist Member States without taking away responsibility from individual countries, which must evaluate the connection between life expectancy and the compulsory retirement age."
"It also aims to remove obstacles to cross-border mobility and establish a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority with responsibility for setting up a system of coordination in emergencies and supporting Member States."
"The European Union's 27 Member States have different pension systems."
"However, the inverted population pyramid and the increase in life expectancy require a European strategy to be devised for strengthening the cohesion and coherence of pensions in the European Union."
"I would also like to mention, nevertheless, the inadequacies which are evident in the case of labour mobility between different Member States."
"There are cases where pension rights are not transferred adequately between different European Union Member States."
"In this respect, we must encourage cooperation between Member States."
"On the other hand, we have a moral duty to safeguard our citizens' right to enjoy pensions which provide them with a decent living."
"in writing. - I can support the overall objectives of this report as its fundamental concerns are to create a sustainable approach to pension provision."
"The regulatory exercise which will come about from the Green Paper will, I believe, bring supervisors up to speed with the necessary consistency to maintain a safe and sustainable pension system."
"However, given the current diversity in pension systems in Member States as well as in scope and depth of pension provision, it is important that the Commission follows through on Parliament's wish not to impose capital standards akin to insurance or banking standards."
"It is my belief that pensions can and should be treated separately for their own capital adequacy requirements."
"This all said, the need for a truly European approach is paramount, given the way in which demographic trends will force future generations into sustaining expensive schemes, overloaded, with past generations facing potential poverty."
"in writing. - Mr President, there is much to like in this report."
"However, I cannot, on balance, support it."
"It is right that we in this house should have concern for the pension provisions of our Member State governments, and it is right that we should share best practice."
"However, I was simply unable to support the report as a whole because I simply disagree that the EU should have anything beyond an information-sharing role for pensions."
"The best authorities to deal with pensions, and indeed all social matters, are the national or local authorities, not us."
"This initiative report calls for too much centralised control, which I am simply unconvinced will either work or add value."
"in writing. - (NL) The problem of our increasingly ageing population is hitting us hard and the crisis is prompting Member States to make cuts."
"However, we should not allow the ageing population problem to lure us into a new European debt crisis."
"The Member States that are making savings should not go about it unthinkingly."
"The resolution emphasises that the first pillar of the pension system is the main one."
"This implies a healthy and balanced national budget."
"Moreover, it goes without saying that a steady income is a safeguard against poverty."
"I am also pleased with the recognition of pension rights for women and a greater emphasis on gender equality, along with the recognition that discrimination against older people in the labour market should not be allowed."
"The resolution also pays due attention to the transferability of accrued pension entitlements."
"No one these days works for the same company, or even in their own country, for their whole life."
"It is fundamental, in a united Europe, that citizens are able to transfer such entitlements."
"The European Parliament is therefore asking the European Commission to better coordinate the transferability of pensions at a European level."
"in writing. - (RO) The report drafted by Ria Oomen-Ruijten on the Green Paper entitled 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems' makes an important contribution to the debate on the future of European pension systems."
"I think that Member States need to draft provisions for ensuring adequate pensions for their citizens."
"We encourage Member States to set up the most adequate pension system to guarantee a decent standard of living for everyone, with particular attention being focused on the most vulnerable groups in society."
"I voted for point 24, which calls on Member States to encourage older people to continue working through fiscal and social security exemptions."
"I also voted to encourage and facilitate combining work with retirement and to put in place dissuasive measures so that companies find it harder to make older people redundant."
"I voted against raising the retirement age because I think that people who pass a certain age, but who will and can work, should be encouraged and not forced to work, especially at a time when the unemployment rate in the EU-27 is 10%, and 20% among young people."
"The European Commission's Green Paper on European pension systems adopted today under the report by the alliance of the political representatives of capital in the European Parliament (social democrats, conservatives and liberals) is an anti-grassroots monster."
"It is intended to form the basic element of the new anti-grassroots EU Competitiveness Pact designed to demolish European social security systems and replace them with private, individualised insurance, a new cash cow being milked at the workers' expense for the benefit of capital."
"In practice, public spending on social security, pensions and welfare is being abolished."
"The three pillar system reduces the State pension to a poorhouse benefit, thereby throwing the gates wide open to the so-called third pillar of private insurance."
"There are calls for an increase in the retirement age, depending on life expectancy; in other words, work to the grave."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the EU's abortive anti-labour paper on European pension systems."
"Faced with these developments, we would point out that the workers urgently need to rise up en masse and stop these new anti-insurance measures and the new savage attack being organised by capital and the bourgeois governments in the new EU Competitiveness Pact."
"in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of the Oomen-Ruijten report on the Green Paper on pension systems."
"The results of the negotiations are appropriate in the opinion of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and provide the appropriate basis for the subsequent White Paper."
"What is important going forward is retention of the German occupational pensions, the length of service and protection against the risk of bankruptcy for existing commitments."
"Under no circumstances must occupational pensions be transferred to a compulsory European system."
"in writing. - (LT) I am pleased that the rapporteur recognises that there are significant gaps in the pension systems in Europe and the fact that the citizens of some Member States - for instance, Lithuanians - face additional problems."
"Life for pensioners in my country is not the easiest."
"Recently it has become even harder - last year Lithuanian pensioners' monthly pension was reduced by 5%."
"The time has come to stop applying double standards."
"In some European countries, such as Lithuania, the government maintains that the crisis is over and that the economy is gradually beginning to recover."
"However, when we need to take practical measures, our leaders state that they cannot find the required resources to return pensions to their former level."
"Suddenly they declare that the crisis is not yet over."
"In reforming our pension systems financial sustainability is important, but so too is providing an adequate income."
"Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved without ensuring that pensions are adequate."
"Ageing society and financial pressures show that our labour market is changing."
"It is necessary to take this into account when reforming pension systems."
"A balance between flexibility and security on the labour market supports the adaptability of the economy and thus contributes to sustainable, secure and fair pensions."
"in writing. - (NL) Europe and pensions, now that is a sensitive issue."
"Various Member States are considering arrangements to shrink their national debts by tying pension funds to their debts."
"Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have already directly mentioned the centralisation of pensions in their plans for a single, centrally-ruled Europe."
"I am against any regulation of pensions at a European level."
"Pension systems are structured differently in the various Member States."
"They are almost incomparable."
"In addition, the pension systems in the various individual Member States vary considerably, in terms of size, reliability and supervision."
"I do not want to see the robust Dutch pension system suffer because of the chaos in some other Member States."
"What I do find sensible, however, is that Member States should share information about their pension systems with each other and that they should make efforts to address specific problems by that means."
"I refer here, for example, to university researchers who move to other Member States, whose tax authorities then collect additional levies on the pensions they have built up elsewhere."
"An immediate halt should be put to such excesses, but that does not mean that we need to revamp the entire system on a European model."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report urging Member States to ensure pensions are sustainable in light of the challenges of ageing societies and the spending pressures being faced across the EU."
"I welcome that this report recognises that there is no 'one size fits all' approach to pension provision across Member States, but that the EU can clearly add value in sharing ideas and coordination."
"The inclusion of private debt in any assessment of sustainability of public finances should not be included in this report, as current market conditions would not support this kind of assessment."
"Furthermore, applying capital requirements to pensions could potentially drive up costs without adding security for employer-funded occupational pensions."
"This should not be made compulsory where there is an existing protection scheme; for example the UK's Pension Protection Fund, set up by the previous Labour Government, already provides a high level of protection to pension scheme members and beneficiaries."
"I, and my Labour colleagues, will continue to work to ensure that people who save with the State, with their employer or privately are given the genuine pension protection they need to feel safe about their retirement."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, although I feel that the text adopted is overcautious in repeatedly indicating the importance of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I nevertheless believe that this report, pending the imminent publication of the Commission White Paper, can allow the continuation of an effective working relationship between the Member States and EU institutions on the difficult issue of the modernisation of European pension systems."
"I am voting for this motion for a resolution, as I believe that the accession negotiations with Croatia may be concluded in the first half of 2011, provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued."
"To achieve this, during this last stage Croatia will need to mobilise all its efforts to strengthen public administration and the judiciary, to make progress on combating corruption, to ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, to continue with the privatisation process, and to adopt restructuring plans."
"I am also voting for this resolution because it recommends the implementation of an arbitrary border agreement between Croatia and Slovenia, and because of the progress made in resolving other bilateral disputes, such as border issues with Serbia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"Although Croatia still has to conclude negotiations on six political chapters of the acquis communautaire, I believe that the good results achieved in 2010 will serve as a basis for the Croatian authorities to make final efforts to complete the negotiations."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Croatia."
"With this document the European Parliament confirmed that Croatia has made significant progress in the talks on integration into the European Union."
"I agree with the resolution's provision that the accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed in the first half of 2011 provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued resolutely by, in particular, strengthening public administration and the judiciary, continuing to combat corruption, ensuring the sustainability of refugee return, full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the continuation of the privatisation process and the adoption of restructuring plans for the shipyards in difficulty."
"These are very important conditions, and their proper implementation or at least significant progress in the areas mentioned will show Croatia's commitment and willingness to become an EU Member State."
"in writing. - (LT) I agreed with this motion for a resolution, through which the European Parliament supports Croatia's accession to the European Union."
"The accession of Croatia entails both a European and a regional dimension, and would encourage the rest of the countries of the Western Balkans to launch and implement accession-related reforms."
"The accession negotiations with Croatia have progressed significantly, but fundamental reforms in the areas of public administration and the judiciary, corruption, refugee return and so on, have yet to be completed. Croatia must make significant progress in the resolution of bilateral disputes with neighbouring countries, such as the border issues with Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, so as to prevent these disputes from becoming an obstacle to further enlargement of the EU once Croatia has joined."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of adopting the progress report on Croatia because I think that the EU accession process highlights the significant improvement in the situation in this area."
"Indeed, respect for fundamental rights, the situation of refugees and the privatisation of the shipping sector are the most advanced chapters."
"I would also like to welcome at this point the implementation of the peace agreement and everything that this entails."
"Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is crucial to the successful conclusion of the negotiations."
"I hope in the future that the Croatian authorities will allow investigators to have access to the necessary documents."
"One of the issues mentioned in the document is war crime trials."
"Those who have been brought to justice are either not convicted or receive token punishments."
"I wish to stress the importance of administering a fair justice system for any candidate country."
"The legacy of conflict in the 1990s and a lack of respect for minorities' rights are unacceptable from a future Member State."
"Legislative intervention is desired in this area."
"The Hungarian Presidency's intention to complete the negotiations by the end of the first six months in 2011 is commendable and Croatia can potentially cross the finishing line on time."
"Its accession will send out a positive signal in the region, reaffirming the EU's credibility with regard to the conditionality of this process."
"I wish to end by confirming Romania's unreserved support for Croatia's accession to the EU."
"The country report on the progress made by Croatia in 2010 indicates the determination of the government in Zagreb to meet the European Union's accession criteria."
"However, the European Union is confronted with a first-time situation in that the majority of Croatia's citizens do not think that accession to the EU will benefit the country, which is in contrast to the significant wave of optimism seen among the population of the Central and Eastern Europe states which joined in the last two rounds."
"The 2010 country report on Croatia highlights the EU institutions' concern about this situation."
"This is why an appeal has also been made to authorities and civil society to get involved in convincing Croatians that EU membership will have a positive impact on their country."
"I welcome the efforts of the Croatian authorities and their ambition to conclude the accession negotiations this spring."
"Croatia also deserves to be congratulated on the fact that a state ravaged by conflict for so long has managed to make remarkable progress to implement the acquis communitaire."
"Furthermore, any kind of mention about Croatia's accession possibly being deferred can only be treated as a throwaway remark made without too much thought."
"I voted decisively in favour of this report because I believe that Croatia is correctly continuing with its implementation of the reforms necessary for EU membership."
"At an economic level, I think that Croatia is ready to deal with other EU countries."
"In fact, despite the global crisis, it has managed to maintain a certain macroeconomic stability, particularly through the development of service and tourism infrastructures."
"I think the country should be encouraged to take full advantage of its resources, particularly its geographic position as a strategic transport link between Western Europe and the Balkans, between Central Europe, the Adriatic and the Mediterranean."
"Further development of its infrastructure could provide enormous potential to the country."
"With this in mind, its cooperation with the European Union on the implementation of sections of the TEN-T, TEN-E and e-TEN, which also affect Croatian territory and could be developed into a PPP system in full cooperation with the EU, is proving very fruitful."
"The negotiations will close in the first half of 2011, when the accession process will be concluded."
"I am confident that this deadline will be met."
"I would commend Croatia for the substantial progress achieved in attaining the benchmarks needed to conclude the accession negotiations."
"I strongly believe that Croatia's swift accession will contribute to encouraging the rest of the countries in the Western Balkans to implement accession-related reforms."
"I welcome the efforts of the Croatian Government to take a strong stance against all forms of corruption, but call on the Croatian authorities to further strengthen the administrative capacities of anti-corruption bodies and to foster a culture of political accountability."
"I welcome the progress made in the area of women's rights and gender equality, as some 25% of parliamentary seats and almost half of administrative positions in the public sector are held by women, demonstrating the progress towards gender equality."
"However, the percentage of women occupying positions of business leadership remains low and gender wage differences persist."
"I call for further active promotion of the participation of women in economic and political decision-making bodies, and for swift implementation of the Gender Equality Law, including the principle of equal pay."
"in writing. - (DE) We expressly support Croatia's swift accession to the European Union."
"The people of Croatia have great expectations of this membership."
"However, these can only be fulfilled if Croatia is truly ready for accession and all accession criteria are met."
"Croatia has already come further in this process than many current EU Member States had come on accession."
"The Commission's progress report clearly shows, however, that there is still work to be done in some areas."
"This gives reason to hope for a swift conclusion to the accession negotiations - expectations must not be raised by today's decision, however."
"Thoroughness is more important to us than speed and reliable implementation is more important than promises."
"We must not repeat previous mistakes."
"Anything else will not be in the interests of the European Union or Croatia and its people."
"We have therefore abstained from voting today."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Croatia, as I believe that the negotiations on Croatia's accession to the EU will be completed by June 2011, provided that the necessary efforts toward reform continue to be made."
"I am in favour of expansion, provided that candidate countries meet the pre-established criteria."
"The more countries there are in the European project, the better it is for the EU and for its citizens, who will enjoy a single area of peace, freedom, democracy, progress and well-being."
"Croatia has been meeting the accession criteria with undeniable success, and has been making an effort to continue down this path, despite the additional difficulties it faces in the current international situation."
"It is a good example for any country intending to become part of the European Union."
"I cannot fail to notice that the most recent surveys show Croatians to be suspicious of their country's future entry into the Union and critical of the EU's actions."
"Instead of questioning the opinion of the Croatian people, I believe that their doubts merit serious reflection on how the European Union has been run."
"I find it regrettable that, in her motion for a resolution, the rapporteur has chosen to give opinions about issues such as sexual orientation and its constitutional protection, which not only have nothing to do with the real issues in question, but should also be the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"This motion for a resolution is on the 2010 progress report on the process of Croatia's accession to the EU; a commitment by the European Parliament, for which no diplomatic efforts have been spared."
"I welcome the progress made in the accession negotiations, which should be completed by the end of the first half of 2011, as well as all the efforts made by the European Commission towards the other countries of the Western Balkans joining the EU."
"I find it regrettable that the Croatian Parliament and government have not made the desired progress on constitutional amendments, namely as regards decentralisation and reform of public administration, particularly by depoliticising it, combating corruption and freedom of the press."
"I hope that all the problems mentioned in the report will be resolved or, at least reduced, so that accession is quick and can act as a catalyst for membership by neighbouring countries."
"Regarding this report, it is important to point out that the majority of Members of the European Parliament are not happy about the fact that, according to Eurobarometer, the majority of the Croatian population believe that accession to the EU 'would not benefit them'."
"What can be done to counter this perception?"
"The answer, as always, is to increase the propaganda, seeking to manipulate the reality of what the EU is."
"The same old neoliberal dogmas are being wheeled out: the reduction of state intervention in the economy, and the creation of an open and competitive market, by destroying public services, by changing labour relations in capital's favour under the pretext of their 'rigidity', and by doing away with sovereignty and with an independent project for Croatia's development."
"Lastly, the report makes it very clear who the beneficiary of NATO's aggression and the breakup of Yugoslavia was."
"Croatia is in a privileged location: it is a transport corridor of great importance for the import and export markets of the East and Far East."
"It is clear that accession to the EU is not to promote the right to development of Croatia and its people, but above all to benefit the great powers and their economic groups."
"Recently, Croatia has made considerable progress towards EU accession and will probably soon become the twenty-eighth Member State of the EU."
"In 2010, negotiators for the EU and Croatia closed 11 chapters, achieving a total of 28 (from the required 35)."
"Last year's achievement emphatically shows Croatia's determination to continue with its reforms and will soon allow its citizens to benefit from EU membership."
"During the last meeting of EU and Croatian ministers which took place on 22 December 2010 in Brussels, the negotiators closed three important chapters, namely those concerning justice, freedom and security, foreign, security and defence policy, and the environment."
"The closure of these chapters indicates that Croatia's legal system has been strengthened and that progress has been made in several areas simultaneously, such as wider cooperation between Croatia and the international community concerning military missions and civil affairs (""foreign, security and defence policy), and the guarantee of better air and water quality for the population of Croatia (environment)."
"Negotiations on the accession of Croatia to the European Union began in October 2005."
"In spite of some logistical problems, Croatia's accession is strongly supported by EU Member States and many of them expect a rapid progress towards the closure of the seven remaining chapters by the end of 2011."
"I voted for the motion for a resolution."
"Croatia clearly has a place in the European Union."
"However, I will not vote for further membership unless the budget of the Union is substantially increased."
"Further enlargement cannot be achieved without additional funds for the Union."
"My vote on the motion for a resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this Parliament on the progress of Croatia towards membership is a sign of no confidence in the benefits of the European Union which, according to the opinion polls, is shared by the majority of Croatians."
"It is regrettable that the authorities of a country which has become independent and sovereign in the wake of a terrible conflict have not wished to rest until they have placed the country under a foreign yoke, against public opinion."
"I voted against the Treaty of Maastricht."
"I voted against the European Constitution."
"I would have voted against the Treaty of Lisbon if my Government had had the courage to put it to the French people."
"I hope that the Croatians will be consulted directly on the accession of their country to the Union and that their will, unlike that of the French, the Irish and the Dutch, will be respected."
"To vote in favour of a resolution which regrets that the fate of minorities practicing this or that sexual deviance is not a central preoccupation, which advocates intensive propaganda to reverse negative opinion polls, which encourages the same economic errors as those committed in our countries, was really not possible."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the progress made by Croatia, which confirms the efforts made by the latter with regard to its forthcoming accession to the European Union."
"Indeed, Croatia's membership has several advantages, such as consolidating peace and stability in the Balkan region and strengthening the position of the EU in that region."
"The text we have adopted also raises issues that remain problematic and on which Croatia must continue to work, such as combating corruption, which remains one of the major scourges in the country, and giving support to returnees, which is still inadequate."
"I hope that Croatia will continue further along this positive route."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the 2010 Progress report on Croatia, because with this document the European Parliament confirmed the fact that Croatia has made progress in the talks on integration into the European Union."
"Accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed rather quickly, provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued and implemented resolutely."
"It is necessary to continue to strengthen public administration and the judiciary, combat corruption, ensure the sustainability of refugee return, and fully cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and so on."
"Furthermore, the Croatian Government urgently has to address the structural weaknesses of the economy and devote greater attention to regional cooperation, in order to tackle bilateral issues with neighbouring countries."
"Proper implementation or at least significant progress in these areas will demonstrate and strengthen Croatia's willingness and opportunities to become an EU Member State."
"I believe that the accession of Croatia would also encourage the rest of the countries of the Western Balkans to move closer and more quickly towards EU Membership."
"With its motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Croatia, Parliament's aim was to applaud the improvements made by Croatia in several respects, which are bringing the country ever closer to the European Union."
"That country's achievements over the last year deserve to be mentioned, as substantial changes have been made to the Constitution in order to adapt it to the founding charters of the other 27 Member States."
"With regard to the judiciary, efforts have been made to make that power impartial and independent."
"Trials have also been organised for war crimes, and considerable progress has been made on women's rights and gender equality."
"I fully agree with this motion because I strongly believe that Croatia deserves to become a Member State."
"There is no doubt that even more must be done, especially as regards the fight against corruption, but the fact remains that the country is making significant headway in its path to membership of the European Union."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for this report because what we all want is a stable, prosperous neighbourhood."
"Indeed, these aspirations can only be fulfilled by integrating the Western Balkans into the EU and Euro-Atlantic structures."
"Croatia is the state in this region which is at the most advanced stage in the EU integration process, highlighting that it has and wants to use robust mechanisms to combat corruption in the public sector."
"Zagreb has already made progress on this matter through its parliament's approval of a law allowing the confiscation of assets obtained illegally, as well as by the actions taken against senior officials."
"I welcome these measures, but Zagreb needs to demonstrate convincingly that it has left behind its widespread culture of corruption and impunity."
"Croatia can continue to count on Romania's support in the European Union accession process by sharing common experiences regarding both the pre-accession process and the aspects after the country's EU accession."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution in order to acknowledge Croatia's progress towards EU accession and highlight the remaining goals to be achieved for the benefit of its people."
"I voted against Amendments 1 and 4 because they were intended to delete references to government efforts in Croatia to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation and race, which are required for EU accession."
"When the resolution was in the AFET Committee, I contributed amendments concerning the efficiency and predictability of the justice system."
"They called for increased funding for courts to work fast and efficiently, unification of jurisprudence, and timely publication of all judgments."
"Corruption cases have to come to court and not remain at the prosecution/investigation stage, and sentences must have deterrent effects."
"The efficiency of the pre-accession funds spent in the area of justice reform and the combating of corruption must be assessed."
"in writing. - I voted for this report but retain serious doubts about Croatia's suitability for membership."
"Significant progress needs to be made in a number of areas, not least in tackling corruption."
"Croatia's accession to the European Union is a significant incentive for the Balkan countries to pursue their own efforts and reforms with a view to their future accession to the Union."
"Croatia's accession to the Union will extend the area of peace and stability in Europe, and it therefore entails a dual European and regional dimension, which should encourage the Western Balkan countries to achieve greater cohesion at regional level."
"I welcome the positive progress made by Croatia with regard to respect for and protection of minorities, though the country should also take appropriate measures to ensure greater protection of the Roma minority and its participation in civil society."
"The Roma are still discriminated against and do not have adequate representation in Croatian central and local political authorities."
"Synergies must be developed and implemented at regional level, particularly within the framework of the Danube Strategy, as more social interchange and economic trade would benefit the entire Danube macro-region."
"I refer in particular to cooperation in the areas of transport, the environment and economic development."
"Greater cohesion at regional level will facilitate the future access of the entire Western Balkans region to the European Union."
"It is not surprising that the Eurobarometer has indicated that the Croatians think that the European Union is not beneficial to them, as that is indeed the case."
"I am voting against this motion for a resolution and its antisocial injunctions."
"Negotiations with Croatia on its accession to the EU may be concluded shortly."
"However, the necessary reforms need to be pursued with determination."
"The most important reforms are the strengthening of public administration and the judiciary, combating corruption, supporting the return of refugees, fully cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and restructuring the shipyards."
"We must applaud the enormous progress already made."
"However, at this final stage it is necessary to continue resolutely with the reforms needed to be able to conclude the negotiations regarding EU accession on time."
"The fact that that the majority of Croatian citizens believe that accession to the EU would not benefit the country is worrying, so we need to work to ensure that Croatians see the European project as being theirs as well."
"It is therefore crucial to give the citizens clear and factual information on the implications of Croatia's accession to the EU."
"in writing. - (ES)While I consider the accession of Croatia to the EU to be positive, provided that the Croatian people see it as so, I have not supported this motion for a resolution since they are various points that I reject, above all those related to the EU's economic requirements."
"I think the request that the Croatian authorities adopt measures that define and improve the participation of civil society players in the process of policy formulation and supervising the activities of the public authorities activities is both appropriate and valuable."
"However, I cannot support the resolution given that I am totally against the neoliberal economic focus it contains and the measures that it asks to be implemented in this area."
"Thus, I think it unacceptable that the EU demands that the Croatian Government reduces the redistributive role of the state and public spending and I reject the call to apply 'profitability' as a principal criterion to evaluate the public health and social systems."
"I am delighted with the progress made by Croatia in its accession into the European Union, including the amendment of the Constitution, the reform of the judiciary, freedom of the press, the protection of minorities, and closer cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"I therefore fully support the 2010 progress report on Croatia."
"The prospect of joining the European Union is a powerful incentive for the other countries of the Western Balkans moving towards European integration to carry out the necessary political, economic and legislative reforms, to strengthen stability, and to promote coexistence and reconciliation in the region."
"However, the Croatian authorities still have obstacles to overcome and challenges to address, such as combating corruption, getting the economy back on track, resolving bilateral disputes with neighbouring countries, and very low employment."
"It is therefore necessary to urge Croatia to press ahead with the necessary reforms so as to meet the final criteria and to complete the negotiations."
"in writing. - (DE) By supporting the motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on Croatia I would like to express my support for the swift acceptance of this country into the EU."
"It is not only culturally and historically rooted in Central Europe, it also meets the accession criteria."
"Although work still needs to be done in many areas, such as the fight against corruption, in light of the prosecution of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader, there is no lack of positive will."
"Croatia also seems to be prepared to deal with its past, as evidenced, for example, by the support for returning war refugees."
"This has also been described in detail in the resolution."
"However, by supporting several amendments, I have also expressed my rejection of the politically correct language of the resolution."
"In several paragraphs it is absolutely intolerable."
"However, so as not to block the Croatian people's path to the EU and to demonstrate our good will, I finally voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (DE) Among the candidate countries, Croatia is the country that has made the greatest amount of progress."
"Thus, Croatia has proven its readiness to join the EU many times, for example with the settlement of the fishing dispute."
"Progress has also been recorded with regard to the fight against corruption, as can be seen by the arrest of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader."
"When it comes to addressing the issue of war crimes, Croatia seems to be moving away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees."
"The motion for a resolution contains a few superfluous, overly politically correct platitudes, for example with regard to the protection of transsexuals in paragraph 5."
"However, the report is, by and large, acceptable."
"It refers to the progress that has been made and seeks a swift accession process."
"That is to be welcomed, as, from a cultural and historical point of view, Croatia is firmly rooted in Central Europe."
"I therefore voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"Croatia is one of those countries which are drawing nearer to accession to the European Union."
"During the last few years, Croatia has shown great initiative and has made progress in many areas, from the judiciary, to human rights."
"Progress in these areas has given me great satisfaction, as a year ago I called on the Croatian Government to increase its efforts in amending its legislation in exactly these areas."
"Croatia is currently struggling with the same problems as the majority of previous and current candidates for accession to the European Union, namely corruption, settling historical differences with neighbouring countries, and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"Solving problems of this type requires a huge effort not only from the authorities, but also from society. One cannot change the situation of sexual or ethnic minorities without exerting some influence on the citizens' outlook."
"However, as the example of new Member States has shown, belonging to the European Union gradually helps to foster acceptance of persons of foreign descent or differing sexual orientation."
"The message that the European Union is ready to accept a new member into its community should be conveyed to Croatia."
"I hope this will happen soon."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, because Croatia has made huge progress in attaining the criteria necessary for the conclusion of the accession negotiations."
"Furthermore, it should be taken into account that the accession of Croatia would also encourage the rest of the countries of the Western Balkans to move towards EU Membership more quickly."
"I welcome the Croatian Government's efforts to combat various forms of corruption and the reforms of the public administration, and the judiciary being implemented."
"However, in order to properly implement the principles of the rule of law and gain citizens' confidence in the judiciary, the number of unresolved cases must be significantly reduced and the length of court procedures shortened."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that war crimes trials are unbiased and impartial."
"I agree with the proposal that greater attention must be paid to the safety of the Danube power plants due to be built."
"Furthermore, the Croatian Government urgently has to address the structural weaknesses of the economy and devote greater attention to regional cooperation, in order to tackle bilateral issues with neighbouring countries."
"I believe that negotiations with Croatia should only be completed once all the necessary reforms and other obligations have been implemented and without setting a specific time limit."
"The Balkans region is crucial to the future geopolitical configuration of the European Union and, in this regard, Croatia is the country that has made the greatest progress in the accession process."
"Europe could make a real difference in that region by acting as a real driving force through economic and political reforms."
"That is why I voted for the motion for a resolution, given the policy of integration and expansion toward the democracy and market economy of south-west Europe."
"It is my opinion that disrupting and/or impeding enlargement to embrace the Balkans will certainly not save the fate of the European economy."
"It is important, then, to see Croatia as a nation that will help the entire Union to open its doors to other countries in the region."
"It will thus play a strategic role as a forerunner of this new process of integration and development."
"Croatia's path to accession of the European Union has progressed significantly; progress has been noted particularly in attaining the benchmarks set in the negotiating chapters."
"It should be stressed that, according to Eurobarometer, the majority of the Croatian population believed very recently that accession to the EU would not benefit them."
"It is important to give consideration to whether or not the Croatian people want to join the EU and to allow them a free choice."
"The expansion of the European project is desirable, and beneficial to the creation of a single area of peace, freedom, democracy, progress and well-being."
"However, it is crucial that this project is and continues to be based solely and fundamentally on the will of the people."
"Croatia's accession is important in geopolitical terms in order to encourage the rest of the countries of the Western Balkans to launch and resolutely implement reforms related to accession to the European project."
"Following these benchmarks, I voted for this resolution."
"in writing. - (RO) I welcome the progress made by Croatia in fulfilling the criteria required to conclude the accession negotiations."
"However, the Croatian Government needs to improve the coordination of central administrative institutions responsible for environmental management, in particular those for spatial planning, as well as waste, water and air quality management, in order to be able to preserve sufficiently a unique environment and maintain a high level of biodiversity."
"I think that the region's economic development could be accelerated through close cooperation between Croatia and the other countries as part of the Strategy for the Danube Region, using various forms of cooperation in the field of transport, the environment and economic development within the Danube macro-region."
"I abstained from this vote."
"I am not opposed in principle to any country's entry to a Union that I do not wish to see as a club closed to countries that respect minimum values of democracy and human rights, and whose people freely choose accession."
"However, I cannot accept the pressures being applied to Croatia to speed up processes of privatising public companies."
"Nor can I accept the Commission's political interference in the internal decision-making process by supporting organisations that advocate accession in a country where, as the latest Eurobarometer shows, the majority of citizens believe that it would not be beneficial; this is not surprising if we consider the antisocial nature of current EU policy."
"Accession negotiations with Croatia can be completed in the first half of 2011 provided that the necessary reforms continue to be pursued resolutely by, in particular, continuing to combat corruption, ensuring refugee return, restructuring shipyards, as well as reforming the Constitution and the judiciary."
"Regarding corruption, although I acknowledge the commitment of the Croatian Government, which is evident for example in the trials involving two former ministers and a former prime minister, this is nevertheless a phenomenon that continues to be a serious and widespread problem."
"Judicial system reforms must also continue, notably by continuing the prosecution of war crimes and improving witness protection programmes."
"The biggest challenge, however, could be that of explaining the benefits of EU membership to a somewhat sceptical population."
"Indeed, a recent Eurobarometer survey indicated that the majority of Croatian citizens believe that EU membership would not benefit the country, which is a concern."
"I therefore call on the government and civil society to work to ensure that the Croatians see the European project as being theirs as well."
"EU membership will in any case be subject to a referendum."
"in writing. - With this resolution, the European Parliament commends Croatia for the substantial progress achieved in attaining the benchmarks necessary for the conclusion of the accession negotiations; it asks Croatia to pursue resolutely the necessary reforms in order to be able to attain the final benchmarks and to conclude the negotiations; and it calls on the Commission to use all its capacities to support Croatia's efforts to attain the benchmarks."
"I voted in favour of this report because it sheds light on Croatia's progress in terms of completing the procedures for accession to the European Union."
"If Zagreb continues on the path of reform as it has done in recent years, there is a very good chance that negotiations will already be completed by June."
"Now, however, the greatest challenge seems to be to convince local people that EU membership will bring real benefits to their country, since a recent official Eurobarometer poll seems to suggest that they believe otherwise."
"In view of the fact that membership will still be subject to a referendum, we must work to ensure that the Croatians see the major European project as belonging to their history and their future."
"in writing. - (NL) By June 2011, candidate country Croatia will have completed its negotiations for accession to the European Union."
"I am pleased with the progress of the negotiations, but I want to see action before then."
"I do not want us to regret Croatia's accession later: let Bulgaria's and Romania's accession be a hard lesson to us."
"On paper, combating corruption is clearly one of the priorities of the Croatian Government, but we have seen very few corruption cases actually come to court."
"The vast majority of cases remain stuck at the investigation stage."
"This is remarkably often the case where senior officials are under investigation."
"I want to see Zagreb take action."
"After all, Croatia will receive some EUR 4 billion euros after it joins the EU."
"We must be able to trust the Croatian politicians who will be responsible for spending that money."
"We must learn from our experience with Bulgaria and Romania."
"These countries joined the EU too quickly and, as a result, European money has found its way into all the wrong kinds of pockets."
"Thus, as long as the fight against corruption remains stuck at the current level, we will be unable to complete the negotiation process with Croatia: it is as simple as that."
"in writing. - The ECR Group is very much in favour of EU enlargement."
"We believe it is one of the more successful aspects of EU policy, provided it is carried out according to rigorous criteria and that lessons are learned from other recent accessions."
"For this reason, we voted in favour of this resolution."
"However, we believe there are serious issues which still need to be resolved before Croatia accedes to the EU."
"Corruption and judicial reform have not been properly addressed."
"We are also concerned about media freedom, the prevalence of organised crime and the massive backlog of court cases."
"Furthermore, there are still unresolved border issues with Croatia's neighbours and we do not wish to see these imported into the EU."
"We do not wish to see Croatia then blocking the aspirations of other candidates."
"We already suffer from examples of this elsewhere."
"in writing. - (DE) The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs is a very balanced one."
"It mentions all of the remaining weak areas that are currently preventing the closure of the last remaining open negotiating chapter."
"In its recommendations to the Croatian authorities, the report is mindful of sustainability, including with regard to the reforms of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, the guaranteed independence of which will be the key to Croatia's future democratic development."
"Moreover, the report does not forget to make the important point that the good work of the Croatian Government must continue with the same level of ambition after accession to the EU."
"Recent months have shown that Croatia's efforts to accede to the European Union as quickly as possible have had tangible results."
"Reforms which began in previous years have contributed significantly to the development of many areas of life."
"It is particularly heartening to see increased cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague and also progress achieved in the field of women's rights and protection of ethnic minorities."
"Regional initiatives, such as an understanding between Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia for a joint railway undertaking are indications of a desire for peaceful cooperation, and contribute to increased economic development in the Balkans."
"European Union Member States should continue to support Croatia's reform programme, paying particular attention to its most pressing problems, namely corruption, high levels of unemployment and the difficult situation the fragmented agricultural sector finds itself in."
"I hope that, in accordance with assurances from the Hungarian Presidency, we will complete negotiations with Croatia in June, and that in the second half of 2011 during the Polish Presidency, Croatia will become a Member State of the European Union."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Signature of acts adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure"
"Colleagues, we shall start with the signing of the Lex Citizens' initiative."
"Dear Minister Martonyi, President-in-Office, dear Chairs, rapporteurs, today we are considering legal matters: the very important signing into law of a very important piece of European legislation."
"It is important because we are giving another check to balance the powers of our institutions."
"This regulation on the European Citizens' initiative, which has been adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, aims at providing our citizens with the same political initiative that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy."
"One million signatures are needed - only 0.2% of our citizens - to invite the European Commission to act in matters that concern them directly."
"It allows them to be heard."
"I will indeed establish a direct link between the citizens and the Union's institutions, bridging the gap between them, between all of us in the European Union."
"The European Parliament and the Council worked hard to achieve a rapid adoption of this citizen-friendly regulation at first reading."
"I would like to thank all those who contributed to this success: the various Presidencies - in particular the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies -, the Commission and the Members of this House."
"I would like to give particular thanks to the Chairs of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI), Carlo Casini and Erminia Mazzoni."
"I will ask you to come forward for the signing of the procedure."
"The four rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald Häfner - I hope you are present and we can go through the procedure together - as well as the many other Members involved as shadow rapporteurs."
"You can be proud of the work done for our citizens."
"With the Council we shall now sign this act into law but, before that, I will ask our guest, who will often be present in the European Parliament this half-year, Minister Martonyi, to say a few words."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, in this unique and solemn moment, I recall the early days of the European Convention when we were discussing how what used to be called the 'democratic deficit of the European integration process' could be eliminated, or at least reduced."
"There was a common goal which we all shared, and that was to enhance the democratic functioning of the European Union."
"One way of doing that has just been found, and that is to foster the participation of the citizens themselves in the democratic life of the Union."
"That is how, and that is why, the right of the citizens' initiative was included in the Treaty, and now citizens can approach the European Commission directly and invite it to submit a proposal for a legislative act of the European Union."
"I firmly believe that this is a milestone on the path towards more democracy in the Union."
"It is also the first element of direct democracy."
"It establishes direct contact and dialogue between the institutions and citizens and encourages cross-border direct dialogue and cooperation."
"It also encourages a sense of ownership: Europe is not them - Europe is us, and Europe will develop as we shape it ourselves, all of us together."
"Yes, our motto, 'A strong Europe with a human touch' depends upon all of us."
"To achieve these goals and to implement the Treaty, clear, simple and user-friendly rules of procedure had to be established."
"This has now been done and was the result of the good cooperation between all the institutions - the Commission, the Council and first and foremost, the European Parliament."
"I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr Maroš Šefčovič of the Commission; I would like to express my thanks to the Spanish and the Belgian Presidencies, both of them members of our trio; and very special thanks and congratulations also have to be extended to the European Parliament, to all those who were involved in this extremely important job: the chairs of the committees, and also the rapporteurs Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald Häfner, and all the other Members who participated in this extremely important work."
"This is a demonstration of the excellent cooperation and understanding not only between the European institutions, but also among the different political families or groups."
"I can only express my hope that this cooperation and this understanding will have set a model for the future, both for the institutions and for the political groups."
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes"
"Rising food prices (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on rising food prices."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, thank you for inviting the Hungarian Presidency to participate in this debate on rising food prices."
"For a second time in three years, the issue is on the agenda."
"Once again, rising food prices are causing social unrest and political instability in several countries."
"Families in the poorest regions of the world are in difficulty."
"Moreover, the Food and Agriculture Organisation tells us that the outlook is not good, with prices set to rise further this year as a result of adverse climatic conditions."
"This is a pressing issue."
"It was discussed between Agriculture Ministers and WTO Director-General Lamy in Berlin on 22 January 2011, and once again in the Agriculture Council on 24 January this year."
"The reasons for this latest rise in prices are complex and are a mixture of structural and temporary factors."
"On the demand side, we have more people to feed than ever before."
"On the supply side, droughts and floods have played their part in wrecking harvests, input costs have risen and this has all been compounded by financial speculation in the commodity markets."
"So what can the European Union do to address this problem?"
"We need to get our internal policies right, we need to improve global governance in this area and we need to make a real contribution to the most vulnerable."
"Now is not the time for complacency, but we did make some important progress in all three aspects as a result of the last food prices crisis."
"The Council, along with Parliament, is engaged in an intensive debate on the future development of the common agricultural policy."
"This is highly relevant with regard to global food security."
"Recent Council debates put food security at the centre of the discussion, asking the question how best to ensure that agricultural production in the EU will be both economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the future."
"Let me also say that we have read with great interest Parliament's resolution on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, based on the report by the honourable Member, Daciana Sârbu."
"There are ongoing discussions in the Council concerning the Commission's Communication of 18 November 2010 on the future of the CAP, and the Hungarian Presidency plans to adopt Council conclusions at the Council meeting of 17 March."
"We hope that the discussions concerning the legislative proposals scheduled to come out in the second semester of 2011 will lead to concrete progress."
"We have made important progress towards a more coordinated and long-term international response to world food security."
"We are a long way from reaching the Millennium Development Goal to halve the world's hungry people by 2015."
"Hunger and food insecurity remain a reality for a billion people, but one of the UN's recent achievements, following much work by the EU, has been the creation of the global partnership for agriculture, food security and nutrition."
"This is being implemented by the revitalised Committee on World Food Security in the FAO."
"The EU has also been spearheading the renewal and modernisation of the Food Aid Convention in order to better contribute to world food security and to improve the ability of the international community to deliver food assistance to the most vulnerable populations."
"This is the way forward in order to enhance global governance in this area."
"From a food security perspective, I would like to remind you of the Commission's Communication on humanitarian food assistance, adopted at the end of March 2010, and the subsequent Council Conclusions in mid-May 2010, thus outlining a new policy framework for EU humanitarian action to strengthen efforts to tackle food insecurity in humanitarian crises."
"The Commission's Communication on assisting developing countries in addressing food security challenges, also adopted last year, called at the same time for a new common food security policy framework, further strengthening EU leadership in the global food security agenda and improving the effectiveness of EU assistance."
"To this end, the Commission and Member States are jointly developing an implementation plan to translate this policy framework into concrete actions on the ground."
"Let me also mention the EU's EUR 1 billion food facility, which was agreed by Parliament and the Council."
"We are in the third year of operation of this instrument which helps farmers in the developing world to increase agricultural production capacity."
"This is a tangible sign of our determination to bring real assistance to the most vulnerable."
"Decisions are about to commence on the future orientation of the EU development policy based on the Green Paper on EU development policy in support of inclusive growth and sustainable development."
"With the Green Paper process, the Commission takes the initiative of attributing priority to economic growth generation, agriculture and food security in development cooperation in order to achieve inclusive and sustainable development in developing countries on the grounds of pro-poor solutions."
"Given the rising food prices and rapid population growth, enhancing developing countries' own food production capacities is of paramount importance."
"We also welcome the new impetus given by the G20 Seoul summit to the WTO Doha development agenda."
"The EU would give full backing to a deal which would make a significant contribution to providing stability by getting rid of export subsidies and prohibiting export restrictions."
"The latter only serve to exacerbate price volatility and have exactly the opposite effect of the one desired."
"Let me now come back to the issue of financial speculation."
"The extent to which it contributes to price volatility is unclear, but there is a good reason to enhance transparency on the commodity markets."
"The French Presidency of the G20 has identified this as a priority for the coming year."
"The Hungarian Presidency of the EU is ready to work shoulder to shoulder with the French Presidency of the G20 to achieve concrete results."
"The Hungarian Presidency is fully committed to working with you towards a first reading agreement on the Commission proposal on over-the-counter derivatives."
"The world's poor and hungry deserve an adequate and lasting response to their worries about rising food prices."
"The European Union has been at the forefront in efforts to tackle the issue since the first crisis three years ago, but more needs to be done."
"The Council remains fully committed to a collective and coherent response, both at EU and international level."
"I am sure we can count on your support in all our efforts."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the Commission on rising food prices."
"It was at my request that this issue was debated at the Agriculture Council of 24 January."
"I therefore also welcome the opportunity given to me to have this dialogue with the European Parliament on a subject of such vital importance."
"On this point, I would like to address two topics, which I think are interconnected: firstly, the situation on the world's agricultural markets, where prices have been rising for several weeks, and, secondly, the G20 process on issues of food security and the volatility of agricultural prices."
"Let us begin with the situation on the world's agricultural markets."
"Different reports produced by several international institutions, including that of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on rising agricultural and food prices have once again placed the world on alert."
"Are we in the process of reliving the same rise in prices as in 2007-2008?"
"Although prices, particularly grain prices, have risen sharply since the summer, and also more recently, we do not seem to have reached the price levels of 2008."
"The situation around the world as regards common wheat is tight, but there is not a problem with market supply."
"Current harvests in the southern hemisphere are larger than expected."
"Nonetheless, to facilitate the end of the marketing years for the European Union market, we are thinking of suspending customs duties for imports under the tariff quotas for common wheat of low and average quality and for feed barley in the belief that this is one of the measures that could help to ease the market a little at European level."
"It should be noted that the forecasts for global common wheat stocks at the end of the 2010-2011 marketing year are higher than in 2007."
"As for sugar, the prices are once again at record highs with, for white sugar, a price close to EUR 625 per tonne in mid-January."
"The increase in prices follows two years of a global deficit resulting from low production."
"The production of the current marketing year was recently revised downwards in certain countries, including Australia."
"However, according to the latest forecasts, the world sugar balance should be in balance for the period 2010-2011."
"However, there is a lesson to be drawn from all this."
"While markets may be tight, there has certainly been an over-reaction at the level of prices given what the physical fundamentals tell us."
"Food security and the underlying issue of the volatility of agricultural prices are clearly global issues, which must be dealt with at a global level, and I am glad that the issue of food security and volatility is one of the priorities set by the G20 in Seoul."
"This is a major challenge for the Commission as a whole."
"As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development I have already, and repeatedly, expressed my commitment in this area, in Berlin at the end of January for example, with my counterparts in the various countries involved in the G20, but also recently, within the United Nations, with the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, during a recent visit to New York."
"Let us also remember that the issue of food security is clearly stated as being one of the challenges of the common agricultural policy (CAP) in the Commission Communication on 'The CAP towards 2020'."
"It is a crucial issue both for the European Union and the world's poorest countries, which is why I am working closely with Commissioner Piebalgs on these issues in order to also adapt the EU's development policy to this issue of food security better."
"Today I would like to share with you my thoughts on these issues, in particular on four areas: transparency, stocks, volatility management options and the role for trade."
"We hear that volatility is aggravated by a lack of transparency both for the physical markets and derivatives markets."
"For the agricultural markets there are sources of data on production, consumption, trade and stocks."
"International organisations, national services and specialised organisations, such as the International Grains Council, produce detailed data on this subject."
"That said, certain data can be improved, especially data concerning stocks, on which there is a lack of information, in particular on the worldwide distribution of stocks."
"The G20 leaders meeting in Seoul also asked the competent international organisations to improve information on stocks and production forecasts."
"Improving the relevance of these data is a prerequisite for improving the transparency of the markets."
"We also need to examine the issue of a forum for discussion at a global level among key market makers, both exporters and importers, so that crises are not simply noted when they occur."
"That is why these three issues are linked: we must first have the information, then be able to process these data, and, finally, have a forum, at international level, where the situation noted can be discussed."
"The Commission has published several communications on the price of agricultural products and foodstuffs."
"In its most recent communication, the Commission launched actions to improve transparency along the entire food chain, and I am cooperating with European Commission Vice-President Antonio Tajani to move this key issue forward."
"Proposals have also been announced to improve the transparency and supervision of products derived from agricultural commodities."
"As volatility increases, it is important that futures markets continue to fulfil their risk hedging and price discovery role."
"We therefore need a balanced and rigorous approach, and I welcome the work carried out by Commissioner Barnier in this area and am fully in favour of his work also covering the specific issue of agricultural raw materials."
"On 2 February the Commission published a new, more global, communication on the commodities market and the financial markets that are derived from it."
"This constitutes a contribution to the discussions conducted within the G20 both on the volatility of commodity prices and on the supervision of derivative markets."
"We want to contribute, together with our G20 partners and more broadly, to more effective regulation of derivative markets in the interest of producers and users alike."
"Therefore, I think that we need to work as a matter of priority in the coming months - until the summer I think - on the following issues: first, the availability and transparency of information relating to private and public stocks as well as to production and consumption; second, the collection, processing and dissemination of this information; the security mechanism for countries facing a situation of food tension; the role and organisation of food aid at international level and in the European Union; the improvement of international governance, for example through mechanisms for institutional dialogue between key countries; the levels of investment in sustainable agricultural production and research not only in the European Union but also in the poorest countries."
"The priority to be assigned to agriculture in development policies is also an issue to be addressed, especially as the Commission is preparing to adapt and reform development policy."
"I think that, in this context, the European Union should have a far greater presence, not only with food aid but, above all, by providing support to countries in the south to enable them to develop their own local production capacities in a sustainable manner."
"In the European Union we need to look more seriously - and I have every intention of doing so - into identifying market mechanisms that would enable us to prevent catastrophes in certain sectors as a result of temporary squeezes on the income levels of producers and input costs."
"I am thinking in particular of livestock breeding."
"Let me turn, finally, to the role of trade."
"We believe that trade can contribute to global food security as it enables available food to be distributed around the world."
"Export restrictions have only strengthened the spiralling increase in prices to the detriment of already fragile countries."
"However, trade policy concerning foodstuffs should be connected to other policies relating to food at the international level if we want a coherent approach on this issue."
"In conclusion, I can assure you that I am closely monitoring trends in food prices and I want to work in the future in consultation with you, here, in Parliament, and with the Council, on this issue, so as to come forward with concrete proposals, first and foremost with the reform of the common agricultural policy, but also with other, more specific, instruments."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, can I thank both the Council and Commission for a very clear statement of their intent on this very crucial issue of rising food prices."
"Those of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are in the Chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight."
"I am delighted that when agriculture suddenly becomes food, we debate this very important issue in the middle of the day when people can hear."
"I think we should remember this."
"(Applause)"
"Let me say very clearly that the disconnect between agriculture and food is part of the problem that we are debating here today."
"The realities of agriculture and the low farm incomes in both Europe and the developing world are central to this debate and, lest we also forget, one of the crucial problems - and the Commission identified it in its position paper - is that rising commodity prices and rising food prices do not translate into higher farm incomes."
"The real problem is that the costs of producing food are rising faster, and this is a treadmill on which farmers cannot continue."
"The challenge for us as policy-makers is how to increase food production in a sustainable way, how to produce more from less, how to manage our stocks and how to deal with the issue of stock dislocation that the Commissioner has identified."
"Global stocks are no longer the key figure; we need to know where the stocks are and to realise that they will not come out of China or India."
"What we need to do - and I think this has started to happen since my report during the last Parliamentary term - is to put agriculture and food centre stage."
"Let me finish by saying this: we need to be cautious as to how we reform our agriculture policy."
"And yes, let me endorse your point about agriculture in the developing world: it has been neglected for far too long."
"It is now high time that our policies assisted that agriculture."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (FR) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I fully agree with the remark that Mairead McGuinness has just made on the fact that there is a fundamental link between the issues of food and agriculture."
"The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe."
"I would first like to make the following observation."
"The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing."
"With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing."
"Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase."
"It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy."
"This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue."
"To do this - what the Commissioner said is important - there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations."
"Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets."
"As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity."
"This leads me to draw two major conclusions."
"Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe's commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors."
"Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally - and Europe is a global player - we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, it is welcome that we are actually discussing agriculture and food issues in the middle of the session on a Wednesday afternoon rather than at midnight."
"I very much welcome that."
"One of the reasons is that the massive volatility that we are witnessing today in food prices has at long last acted as a wake-up call to politicians across Europe."
"Over the last 30 years, we have all become complacent as food prices declined year after year after year in real terms."
"Food has never been cheaper than it has been in the last few years."
"We have come to expect our supermarket shelves to be overloaded and groaning with food 24 hours a day."
"Too much food was thought to be the problem."
"That dominated the debate up until 2007, rather than the problem being too little."
"The recent price spikes are a turning point, a sign that the days of plenty may be drawing to a close."
"Our current agricultural production model has been based on cheap energy, an abundance of land and plentiful supplies of water."
"That model cannot meet the challenges we face in the future."
"A rising population to 9 billion, growing demand from developing countries and the impact of climate change."
"As Professor John Beddington, the UK's Chief Scientific Officer, recently predicted, unless we take action we face a perfect storm of scarce energy supplies, scarcity of water and food shortages."
"We need to act now and build a new agricultural model."
"Europe needs to take the lead and the reform of the common agricultural policy gives us the opportunity to map out a sustainable food production system that can meet that huge demand in world food supplies that is going to be needed in the future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, as in 2008, the price of agricultural raw materials is soaring on world markets."
"We are only at 3% of the 2008 level."
"The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission."
"The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day."
"Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line."
"Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States?"
"Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets."
"This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators."
"The impact is also dramatic for European farmers."
"They are no longer able to feed their animals."
"Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt."
"Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300."
"This is a whole new ball game."
"The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals."
"It would do well, today, to follow its own advice."
"Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions."
"The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions."
"Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price."
"Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices."
"Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, rising food prices can bring governments to their knees."
"We have seen that in recent days."
"I would just like to take us back a little bit."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1989."
"When I came to Europe in 1989, we did not have a food problem."
"We had beef mountains, we had butter mountains, we had milk lakes and we had cereal mountains."
"Now they are all gone and we are not producing enough food fast enough to feed ourselves."
"So where has the food gone and why have we only a small supply?"
"When a drought in any part of the world can actually cause total confusion in the whole market for everyone else, this is not a situation that we can allow to continue."
"We have a situation in the European Union where farmers are leaving the industry hand over fist in every Member State."
"In actual fact, what we are doing is to encourage them to go even faster, and we have no young farmers coming into the industry."
"We must act before it is too late to reverse the trend in rising global food prices."
"This action must be taken sooner rather than later to alleviate the pressure that has been put on ordinary people."
"Shelter for ordinary people can be constructed through a strong common agricultural policy which ensures high-quality food at reasonable prices without negative impacts on the environment."
"A strong pillar of direct payments is vital for the world and to meet food demands."
"Further steps can be taken to solidify this in the future, which is much needed as far as investment and, indeed, research and development is concerned."
"Hopefully we can find a way to do that."
"The problem as I see it is that everyone comes here to these debates and makes all the right statements, says all the right platitudes, but they are not prepared to take the tough decisions necessary to help those most in need."
"I have to say that talking is no longer enough: it is action we need on global stocks and volatility in the market, and until you start to tackle that problem, you will not solve the problem."
"Madam President, as a politician involved in development policy, I always ask myself why it is actually so difficult to learn lessons from past crises and disasters."
"It seems to me that the drama of the hunger riots of 2008 has still made too little impression on the minds and hearts of those with political and economic power and also of those who are unscrupulously speculating on the agricultural commodities markets."
"The number of starving people worldwide has once again risen above a billion, and it is the poorest people in the world who are most affected by the price rises on the food markets."
"They have to spend more than 80% of their money each day on food."
"The global promises of 2009 to provide more than USD 20 billion in agricultural aid to the developing countries, including USD 6 billion via the World Bank, for the fight against hunger have not been honoured."
"So far only USD 925 million has been paid."
"Speculations on the agricultural commodities markets no longer concern foodstuffs but are now almost exclusively concerned with financial market activities and transactions, which have a direct effect on food prices."
"I am therefore pleased that the Commission is now starting to abandon its reticence towards this situation."
"Nevertheless, the speculation in relation to price developments has not become more transparent, nor has it been controlled or restricted."
"However, that is crucial if we are to be able to act effectively here and to bring about changes."
"I therefore call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to give the fight against hunger top priority in all policies, agendas and strategies and also to consider new methods and new approaches, such as food sovereignty, so that ultimately those who work the land have more creative power and influence over the supply of food to their own people in their regions."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, whilst food prices are undoubtedly rising, the situation at the farm gate is very different."
"British farmers producing beef, sheep meat, pig meat and eggs have actually seen a drop in the value of their produce over the last year; poultry meat is unchanged and milk only marginally higher; sugar beet will fall next year."
"These businesses are facing huge cost increases themselves and cannot sustain the status quo for more than a few months."
"Then they will either succeed in claiming higher prices from the retailers or they will cease production."
"Either way, retail food prices can only go higher."
"What is the EU doing about this?"
"Well, it is making it unnecessarily expensive to import non-GM soya beans."
"It is charging farmers a global warming levy on their electricity bills, whilst those same farmers have lost thousands of tons of sugar beet and potatoes in the ground due to very cold weather."
"The EU wants to increase the public subsidy to organic farming rather than allowing this sector to be consumer-led."
"Any switching of conventional production systems to organic will lead to a reduction in food supplies."
"Madam President, the main reasons for food inflation have been rising global commodity prices, soaring energy prices and volatility within the marketplace, and there is no doubt that the consumer is suffering."
"It is, however, the agricultural industry which has been dealing with this for some time, as well as rising feed prices and rising fertiliser prices."
"Profit margins have been reduced and many farmers, especially those in the intensive sectors, face financial ruin."
"I would ask Parliament today to consider the consequences if we did not have support for farmers from the common agricultural policy."
"What would we be paying for food in that financial climate?"
"I would also urge Parliament to consider very strong support for the common agricultural policy in the very important debates that are coming up."
"It is important that we have a policy that will support farmers and ensure adequate food supply at a fair price."
"I would also say that fairness is absolutely essential, and in fairness we need transparency within the food supply chain."
"This will only come, particularly in the United Kingdom, if we have a supermarket ombudsman."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, I will address an issue that has been raised on several occasions and often presented as a single reason: speculation."
"I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required."
"It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials."
"However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility."
"However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature."
"In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner."
"Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility."
"Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities."
"(PT) Madam President, prevention is always better than cure when it comes to disasters."
"There is a real risk of a global food crisis."
"That is not my phrase: it came from the government of one of the founding Member States of the European Union."
"The signs are worrying."
"The prices of some essential food products such as cereals do not stop rising and even hit record levels in January, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation."
"The problem is obviously not European and, as has already been highlighted here today, the contribution of each of the hypothetical causes explaining the phenomenon is very far from being known"
"We know that the Commission is not ignoring the issue, and its communication of 2 February is a document that deserves to be read closely."
"Nonetheless, the specific nature of agricultural production deserves particular attention in the context of the common agricultural policy (CAP), by dedicating proper risk-analysis instruments to development cooperation policy, and by backing food production to the detriment of other forms of international aid."
"I should also like to welcome France's stance in the G20 here, influencing the regulation of the financial markets and the combating of price manipulation, as well as establishing rules that could prevent the sudden interruption of trade flows, as happened with Russia recently, for example."
"Madam President, feeding our population has to be the highest duty of government, and indeed feeding our population is the primary objective of the common agricultural policy."
"Food security is our North Star and this is an EU success story."
"It is worth remembering there have been food riots on every continent but ours over the last year, and we are seeing governments fall on a virtually daily basis, it seems, across the rest of the world, while we have at least been able to provide a degree of a safe haven for our citizens so far."
"So, food security is our priority."
"You would not think it listening to some of the NGOs and lobbyists and, indeed, some of the politicians who have been involved in the debate about the reform of the common agricultural policy going forward."
"Food security must be our focus and must be our priority, and I would disagree on one point with colleagues."
"I do not believe that free trade is the answer."
"I do not believe that global food security is something that we can achieve or should strive for."
"Export bans caused by countries seeking to feed themselves are not, in themselves, unjustifiable, and I would quote the English President of the National Farmers Union, if you would forgive me briefly: 'if we are talking about morality, a country seeking to feed itself is nothing compared to rich countries allowing their agriculture to decline and then expecting the rest of the world to feed them."
"We have a responsibility to lead the world in producing more, not less'."
"(CS) Madam President, if we are to have a genuinely serious discussion about rising food prices, we cannot avoid the issue of how the European Union is itself contributing to this unwelcome trend, however uncomfortable that may be for some."
"All commodities market analysts agree that there are two main factors behind the rise in food commodity prices."
"The first is the large-scale printing of new money in the USA and the European Union in recent months."
"This influx of new money into the markets is pushing the price of food and other commodities upwards."
"It is not speculators that are to blame here, as the report under discussion today asserts, but rather the misguided policies of American, European and other central banks."
"The second factor pushing up food prices is the EU and US policy of forcing consumers to make ever greater use of biofuels."
"The commitments that the EU and the US have assumed in this area have led to a sharp increase in the amount of non-food commodities grown on agricultural land."
"As a result, less and less agricultural land is used for food production, and it is therefore only logical that food prices increase."
"If we want to succeed in lowering global food prices, we must abandon this absurd policy on biofuels."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, all the hungry people in the world, all those who have to pay more to feed themselves or to clothe themselves, expect us to respond with more energy to the greatest calamity afflicting our planet today, that is, the calamity produced by money-grabbing food speculators."
"They are the ones who are driving up food prices to the detriment of farmers and consumers."
"I listened carefully to the impassioned plea by Jean-Paul Gauzès, but he will be aware that, in his region, cereals have been bought this year for the next harvest even before they have been sown."
"Consequently, we are indeed talking about speculation."
"The only way forward is for the European Union to act in several directions."
"Firstly, it must act to stop these financial speculators by setting up a global agricultural and food fund, building up emergency stocks, putting in place mechanisms for stabilising real prices for actual and not virtual production under the auspices of the United Nations Organisation (UNO)."
"Our common agricultural policy must also revert to a system ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Madam President, today in the European Parliament we are discussing the issue of rising food prices."
"This phenomenon, of rising food prices, is felt by consumers in Hungary and other European countries alike."
"Those who do not feel it are farmers and, in particular, smallholders."
"How is this possible?"
"Where does the money go?"
"This puzzle, this mystery is solved, among others, by point (d) of the excellent motion for a resolution submitted by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but the whole motion for a resolution is in itself excellent and I must congratulate them on it."
"It also offers detailed answers and solutions."
"Point (d) draws attention to the phenomenon of speculation."
"It states that there has been an increase in speculation by purely financial institutions, that is, the commodity market speculation of money capital, which is causing an artificial inflation of commodity prices."
"We therefore partially have the solution."
"The money goes to the speculators, and to the purchasers and traders whose hunger for profits often knows no bounds."
"How proud the Hungarian people would be if the Hungarian Presidency treated the resolution of this issue, that of food speculation, as a priority."
"I must ask the attending representative of the Hungarian Presidency whether we can by any chance count on this, and I ask Mr Cioloş, EU Commissioner for Agriculture, what solution he envisages to food-related speculations."
"Madam President, in developed countries the average household spends 10% to 20% of its income on food, whereas in developing countries the figure is generally as high as 80%."
"This underlines the dreadful consequences for those suffering countries."
"We must respond and we must continue responding until they stand on their own feet."
"In December 2008 this Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of my report on the EUR 1 billion food facility to provide financial aid to developing countries in light of soaring food prices at that time."
"The purpose of this facility was to respond to those soaring prices, the causes of which were mainly, though not exclusively, droughts in grain-producing countries and rising oil prices."
"The situation remains extremely volatile, affecting producers and consumers in both the EU and developing countries."
"We must learn how to cooperate with other countries such as Thailand."
"In the region, Thailand is a major producer of food, yet when some of its neighbours like Burma and Vietnam were in poverty and running out of food, we did not accept Thailand's offer to cooperate with us and act as our agent in the region."
"We have to learn how to do that."
"We must ensure a quick transition to stability in North Africa."
"We must ensure that aid is delivered to regions hit by unforeseen natural disasters such as Haiti and Pakistan, and in this regard we must continue to mobilise the reserve for emergency aid, allowing the EU to respond promptly to specific aid needs arising from such events."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first allow to me to express the regret that it took a crisis in Europe to trigger the debate we are having today and the motion for a resolution we will vote on tomorrow."
"Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the 'food riots', Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems."
"We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market."
"There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector."
"With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food."
"Today, Parliament is delivering a clear message."
"It is up to the Commission and the Council to translate it."
"Madam President, by the time I sit down, 16 people will have died of starvation."
"That is about the size of that part of the Chamber over there."
"Every day 36 000 people die of starvation around the world because they do not have enough food to eat."
"The European Union was self-sufficient in food until recently."
"Now it is importing food."
"It is actually taking food away from the poorest people's mouths."
"I am told that the EU is importing from the rest of the world an amount of food that would take about 35 million hectares of land to grow."
"We should be self-sufficient in food, and we should help the developing countries to be self-sufficient in food."
"There is an answer to all this."
"In the 1960s in India, there was a revolution in green agriculture under Professor Borlaug."
"People said that India would starve."
"India did not starve."
"Brazil is now self-sufficient in food."
"We can do it if we have the will."
"(PT) Madam President, three years after the crisis of 2008, the world is on the brink of another food crisis."
"To prevent it, we have to look at its causes and attack them."
"We have to look at the agricultural and trade policies that are destroying small and medium-sized agriculture, that promote models of intensive production for export and that, in this way, threaten food security and sovereignty; as is the case with the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"We have to look at the trend towards increased oil prices and at farmers' high level of dependency on this raw material; this dependency must be reduced."
"We have to look at the enormous power of the agribusiness multinationals that have a monopoly on the key factors of production; at the growing use of fertile soil for purposes other than food production; at the appropriation of land from the local communities that live and work on it."
"Above all, we have to look at and attack the irrationality of an inhuman system that allows speculation on foodstuffs."
"We have to put an immediate stop to the financial instruments that enable speculation: the EU has to accept this or be complicit - as it already is - in its consequences."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, eating and drinking - hardly anything could be more commonplace and self-evident for us."
"However, what we take so much for granted is, for many people, becoming a serious challenge that they are barely able to cope with."
"Food prices have now risen sharply, which has made the situation even worse for many people."
"A package of measures is needed to tackle the multiple causes of the price rise."
"In this regard, it is important to prevent price speculation and to establish stocks."
"In so doing, the dominant position on the market of some food corporations and chain stores must also be examined."
"The developing countries also need greater support from us to develop their agriculture."
"That is the only way we will succeed in providing food for the poorest people and improve their economic situation."
"In order that we may have no misconceptions about this: appropriate prices for agricultural commodities are not the problem."
"On the contrary, they represent the solution to the problem."
"Appropriate prices for agricultural commodities - appropriate, as far as I am concerned, means free of speculation - are, in my opinion, the crucial prerequisite for the establishment of agriculture in the developing countries."
"Adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity."
"Supplying the population with high-quality and affordable food within the European Union, but also worldwide, must therefore be a central concern of European agricultural policy."
"Madam President, for the past 30 years food prices have been both low and stable."
"Now, the United Nations FAO has warned that rising energy costs, growing world population, greater wealth and climate change are about to present huge challenges to the world food system and to the cost of food."
"This will have two important consequences on European governments."
"First, the rising cost of food and energy hits the very poorest families hardest."
"Second, at a time when Europeans most need a period of price stability while the economy recovers, rising food prices will fuel inflation."
"In the short term, the temptation will be to import cheaper food and to expect the food and farming industry to absorb the greater cost."
"Neither route would be wise."
"Over-reliance on imported food would dangerously expose consumers to price volatility, and over-pressuring the farming sector, which already faces steep cost increases and depressed margins, would endanger productive capacity."
"We need to invest in the common agricultural policy."
"Technology will be the key and now is the right time to do this."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in food prices requires two types of response."
"The first concerns the need to plan medium- and long-term actions."
"In this sense, answers must come from the new common agricultural policy, which must ensure food security for European citizens, provide consumers with food at affordable prices and protect farmers' incomes."
"With the new CAP we must give - and this is what we are in fact doing - strong support to farm incomes under the first pillar and support measures for rural development, increasing investment in agriculture and food security."
"The second response is the need to intervene with emergency measures to protect the weakest link in the chain, because when food prices fluctuate, the effects are actually quite strange: when prices rise, producers and farmers do not derive any benefit, but when prices fall, producers see their profits and their already meagre earnings decrease."
"It is clear then that there are problems in the supply chain and a lack of transparency."
"Commissioner, these serious problems in the supply chain include, for example, abuse of dominant purchasing power, unfair contractual practices - including late payments - unilateral changes to contracts, advance payments for access to negotiations and uneven distribution of profit margins along the food supply chain."
"The Commission must propose measures ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social tensions, such as the recent ones in North Africa, are almost always triggered by rising food prices."
"The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand."
"A further - sadly possible - rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income."
"It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy."
"The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies - the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States - have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers' incomes."
"We need, Madam President, a new global food policy capable of coordinating agricultural policies at international level."
"Personally I hope that the forthcoming G20 summit will be an opportunity to actually embark on this new path."
"Madam President, the relentless increase in the price of oil and its consequent upward pressure on fertiliser prices, together with swingeing increases in the price of wheat, maize and other cereals, is creating a crisis in our farm sector, as well as a growing global crisis."
"It is worth remembering that the uprising in Tunisia which set off the domino effect across the entire Middle East began with the self-immolation of a poor street food trader."
"Europe's farmers can make a positive intervention in helping to resolve this crisis if they are provided with the appropriate tools."
"It is time we grasped the opportunities provided by biotechnology to help us meet growing demand for quality food products."
"More than 125 million hectares of GM crops are being grown commercially worldwide by more than 13 million farmers, and yet we do not mention biotechnology in this resolution."
"Wake up and smell the coffee, Europe, before we have food riots on our streets!"
"(EL) Madam President, there are several reasons for the widespread volatility in food prices: extreme weather conditions, limited natural and energy resources and the increase in the world population."
"Another two reasons should also be highlighted: concentrations, by which I mean the oligopoly of the multinationals in the food supply chain, and a lack of transparency and speculation on the commodity markets."
"In the wake of deregulation of the financial markets, futures trading on the commodity exchanges changed from a hedging tool to a tool for speculative transactions."
"The most important exchanges are located outside Europe."
"Following the financial crisis, various hedge funds turned to the commodity exchanges, where financial reserves are now fifteen times higher than actual agricultural stocks, in order to recoup their losses."
"We therefore need an institutional framework limiting their investments in derivative agricultural markets directly linked to the food sector."
"I welcome the initiatives being taken by the French Presidency of the G20 and I firmly believe that maintaining a strong European agricultural sector in order to safeguard food security depends on securing a fair income for farmers and taking effective measures to regulate the market within the framework of the new CAP."
"Madam President, let me make it absolutely clear that I speak on behalf of those in the developing world and not in defence of the common agricultural policy."
"According to the World Bank, over 44 million people have been plunged into dire poverty as a result of rising food prices."
"There are a myriad of contributory factors - fewer smallholdings, deforestation, desertification, lack of access to water and climate change."
"Hence, we need a holistic approach to ensure that we encourage people to take care of their own development needs and to ensure food security at local level."
"We need to reform the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy so that there are no direct or indirect negative impacts on the developing and developed countries."
"We must promote local land ownership and, finally, we must strip away the obscenity of land grab, whereby land is bought and used by foreign investment companies and foreign companies for their own needs."
"There is no defence for this obscenity."
"(PL) Madam President, consumers as well as farmers have every right to ask us politicians what is going on."
"Why is the food market in the situation it is in?"
"Farmers know what profits they make, how much they sell their products for, and they know how much they and other consumers pay for food."
"What can we say to them today?"
"Let us remember 2008 and the situation the food market was in."
"Did we learn from this?"
"My answer is that we did not."
"We are still limiting production."
"To make matters worse, we are paying to reduce production, while previously we paid to increase it."
"This Chamber has heard other comments concerning agriculture."
"Maybe our colleagues should come here today and listen."
"Maybe they would learn something about food security."
"There is a continuing debate about the future of the common agricultural policy post-2013 and once again everyone wants to lower expenditure on the CAP."
"The current situation, this crisis, has occurred to warn us against a disastrous political decision."
"We have a chance to rectify our mistakes."
"We talk about stability."
"We ask why there are no reserves but we are limiting agricultural trends."
"Where are these reserves to come from?"
"Who will pay for them?"
"Commissioner, this situation, this crisis is providing you with exceptionally strong arguments."
"Ladies and gentlemen present in this Chamber, we must convince those remaining of the seriousness of the situation and of the responsibility of this House for the future of the CAP and for feeding our society."
"The problem of food security is becoming a global problem."
"It is good that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Madam President, rising food prices hit the most vulnerable population groups."
"Against a background where, in 2010, the number of undernourished people in the world reached 925 million, providing food security must become a priority for the European Union."
"Extreme natural phenomena are not the only cause of rising food prices, but the volatility of the markets and the subsidy on biogas production also play a role."
"I call on the Commission to create instruments to combat price volatility and excessive speculation, which in turn help exacerbate the global food crisis."
"I must also stress that, in most cases, the rise in food prices does not result either in an increase in farmers' incomes."
"On the contrary, due to the poor operation of the supply chain, the remuneration received by farmers is far from fair."
"I believe that the problem of rising prices helps dismantle the arguments against maintaining a strong common agricultural policy."
"(DE) Madam President, a few days ago one of the largest German newspapers had a picture on the front page of a bread roll with barbed wire around it."
"The article was about the fight for bread."
"I think that there will hardly be a topic that will occupy us as much during this and the forthcoming decades as the question of the availability of food."
"It is therefore good that we are talking about it as the reason for that - namely increasing demand - will not be going away and so prices will also continue to rise."
"We must now give political attention to this whole situation."
"We must consider how we can produce food and make it available."
"Commissioner, the idea of proposing further set-aside areas within the framework of the common agricultural policy by means of screening is the wrong approach."
"We need to make the land that we have productive."
"However, we should not view all of this in too negative a light."
"For years we have complained that food prices are too low."
"If we consider, for example, whether EUR 100 for a tonne of wheat really is an appropriate price then we have to say perhaps not."
"If we consider what proportion of the price of the final product, for instance bread, is represented by the price of the raw materials then I think that the increase in the prices of the raw materials is not the only reason for rising food prices; other factors are also involved."
"Thus, this whole issue is also an opportunity for agriculture to put itself in a better position for the future."
"(DE) Madam President, food prices have reached new record highs."
"The volatility of food prices has increased in recent years for various reasons."
"There is, therefore, great cause for concern."
"Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions and in some countries whole crops have been destroyed."
"In addition, there is increasing speculation on food, the danger of which cannot be overestimated - you only have to look at the financial crisis."
"Moreover, there is increasingly often competition between providing food for the poor and running the cars of the rich."
"We need to find solutions so that farmers have sufficient incentive to produce food and that only areas that are not used for food production are used for the production of the likes of biofuels."
"For me as a Social Democrat it is important that everyone has access to wholesome food at reasonable prices and at the same time that farmers are able to receive a reasonable income for their work."
"(PL) Madam President, let us just say openly that there are powerful trade lobbies active in the European Union in whose interest it is to weaken European agriculture so that greater profits can be made by importing food from all over the world."
"We have heard it said many times in this Parliament that markets should be opened up in order to prevent prices rising."
"We reformed sugar production, opened up the markets, restricted sugar production in Europe and abolished export subsidies."
"What was the result?"
"The result was that sugar prices did not fall, they simply increased."
"This should be a lesson for all of us."
"It is not the way forward."
"I agree with Mr Smith who said that the market is not the answer."
"We really should not bow to the trade lobbyists, but look to guarantee reasonable food prices by better protection of our agriculture, its production potential, and food security."
"Only then will we have sensible prices."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully share the concerns aroused by rising food prices, and I could hardly do otherwise, as this is an issue that is very closely connected to the lives of European citizens and especially of the less well-off classes."
"These increases result in an inability to meet the basic food needs of the populations of all countries in the developing world."
"Faced with this scenario, the developed countries, with the EU Member States among them, cannot remain indifferent."
"In the new common agricultural policy, we must therefore provide instruments that are capable of reducing price volatility, limiting speculation on agricultural commodities and ensuring an adequate level of production within the EU."
"I must therefore stress the fact that we cannot leave land idle at a time when the world population is growing, making it necessary to increase the supply of food."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, I would like to present a statistic, an observation, and three courses of action."
"The statistic is that, whenever food prices increase by 1%, 16 million people around the world are plunged into dire poverty."
"The observation is that, it is impossible to prevent volatility, especially on agricultural markets, extreme volatility is not inevitable and it can be combated, however difficult this may be."
"The three courses of action, which have already been mentioned, are: firstly, to give priority, in development policy, to subsistence farming and regional food markets; secondly, the need for a public regulation policy, including through stock-piling and stock management; thirdly, an outright ban on speculation on basic food products."
"Europe must be there, at the forefront, especially at the level of the G20."
"What I have heard from János Martonyi, Commissioner Cioloş and, in other places, from Commissioner Barnier, is to be welcomed."
"President Sarkozy was very clear and we have great hopes that the French Presidency will be a driving force in this area at the level of the G20."
"(DE) Madam President, market fluctuations are important for the proper functioning of markets in order to create incentives for the buying and selling of goods."
"For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops."
"It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities."
"In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food."
"We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations."
"However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded."
"Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective."
"- (SK) Madam President, the food crisis caused by the exceptionally poor harvest last year has highlighted to us the shortcomings of our agriculture and food policy."
"The current food price increases can be blamed partly on the poor harvest."
"If something is in short supply, the price of that item naturally rises on the market."
"However, the issue is that the shortage of certain agricultural products, Commissioner, may to a large extent be ascribed to the misguided agricultural policy of the European Commission, which has long discriminated against the new Member States and their famers through its subsidy policy."
"Do not be surprised, Commissioner, if farmers who cannot get prices for their products that will at least cover production costs simply do not sow the crop or break up their herds."
"They are waiting patiently until hungry and rightly annoyed citizens direct their anger against those officials in Brussels who have long failed to resolve the general and widely recognised problems of agriculture."
"You know, Commissioner, the shortage of agricultural products in the new Member States is not caused by poor harvests but by the fact that it no longer pays our farmers to produce under your subsidy and pricing policy."
"They are waiting, however."
"When they are given the same subsidies as their counterparts in France, they will definitely start planting crops."
"(DE) Madam President, the provision of daily necessities, and in particular agricultural commodities, must not be left at the mercy of the efforts of speculators to maximise short-term profits."
"The projects announced by the Commission in the new strategy for commodities and raw materials, aimed at securing transparency and stability on the commodities markets, are therefore welcome."
"In view of the forecasts that food production will have to be increased by 70% by 2050 in order to meet demand, particular attention should be paid above all to pillar 3 - recycling and boosting resource efficiency - and proposals should be tabled soon."
"In the area of raw materials diplomacy, I expect the EU to provide developing countries with the expertise to bring about the sustainable and environmentally sound extraction of raw materials."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, an intense debate has been conducted on an issue which clearly causes us concern and which is highlighted when the situation so requires."
"It is, however, a permanent concern of the Commission and the European institutions, since we are lucky enough to have a common agricultural policy, which needs adapting, but which is an important tool in enabling us to manage these issues."
"However, I think that this debate has also shown us that our stability now increasingly depends on international balances and world stability."
"This must be incorporated, even when we talk about our common agricultural policy."
"I think it is also clear that rising food prices is a worrying trend which, in addition to the issue of volatility and the considerable variation in prices, makes the problem we have to solve even worse."
"It is clear that, if there is a need for greater production on the market, there is a need for investment in agriculture."
"However, for farmers to be able to invest, they need, above all else, stable incomes to give them the courage to take this step."
"That is why, in the medium and long term, our common agricultural policy must be conceived with this in mind."
"It must offer a minimum of stability and encourage investment so that our farmers can produce and supply our markets."
"It has also emerged in the course of the debate that it is necessary to ensure that our common agricultural policy and the agricultural policies of developed countries are also in step with the development of agriculture in the southern countries and that our policy to support cooperation and development with the southern countries is in step with the common agricultural policy."
"At the same time, our common agricultural policy must guarantee the sustainable development of agriculture."
"It may be necessary to review the instruments at our disposal for managing these extreme market situations, while allowing the market to play its role without, however, being deprived of the necessary instruments to enable us to act and to avoid being caught unprepared for crisis situations."
"The common agricultural policy still has work to do on this point in the months and years ahead."
"The issue of speculation, and hence of volatility, needs to be addressed, and I am not speaking euphemistically."
"The Commission has already set out proposals, which it intends to follow up, to deal with this situation."
"On this point, therefore, we are not talking simply of wishes but of concrete proposals."
"We must also consider the role that the European Union has to play on the international scene with regard to the food problem."
"This issue cannot be stabilised in the European Union if it is not stable at international level."
"It may also be necessary to review our role in agricultural policy and in development policy and the way in which we address the food issue through different policies: trade policy, development policy, and financial policy."
"Perhaps here too we need concerted action."
"I have also taken account of the need to act in the short term in certain sectors, and I am thinking in particular of the animal sector which, it is clear, is going through a difficult period as a result of strong pressure from all sides, low prices for producers, who are not benefiting from rising prices, and also high prices of inputs."
"I have taken note of this issue."
"I have also noted the various proposals and suggestions that you have put forward."
"As regards the balance of aid between the crop sector and the animal sector, for example, the Member States already have the possibility to act on the decisions taken in 2008 in the health check of the common agricultural policy."
"On the issue of stocks, it is an issue that must be analysed once again and reviewed since, with high prices, it is now impossible to speak of intervention stocks."
"However, it may be necessary to decide what role such stocks can play and how they could influence the proper functioning of the markets."
"I think that these are questions we must ask ourselves before we put forward proposals to this effect."
"Finally, I would like to say to Jaroslav Paška that differences in payment between Member States do not necessarily come from the Commission."
"It is a decision taken by the Council, and by the agriculture ministers."
"The final decision always comes from the regulation proposed by the Commission, but these are regulations of the Council and, now, of the Council and of Parliament."
"I also wish to make clear that no subsidy is given to agricultural production for biofuels in the European Union."
"Therefore, it is not the common agricultural policy that is stimulating the production of biofuels."
"Nor is it the intention of the Commission to set land aside."
"Something quite different is involved but, in any event, land is not going to be set aside in a situation where we actually need to produce."
"These are the various points I wished to add in response to the issues raised."
"I also thank you for this fruitful debate and I hope that today's debate will still be fresh in people's minds in a few months' time when we will discuss the resources to be allocated to the common agricultural policy, a policy that is a basic instrument in addressing food security."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members for this constructive debate."
"I believe that the high level of political attention afforded by Parliament to this issue provides a helping hand to the Presidency to fulfil its agenda with regard to the rising food prices."
"As has also been highlighted in this debate, due to the extent and depth of this issue, it requires multifaceted cooperation and complex solutions across various areas such as agriculture, regulation of financial products and services as well as development policy."
"With respect to biofuel production, I would just like to repeat that the EU is fully aware that the unsustainable production of biofuels can have negative effects, notably mass deforestation and food shortages."
"That is why the EU is committed to stepping up the development of second-generation biofuels made of non-food crops."
"The EU has also abolished the perverse financial incentives for biofuel production at the expense of food production."
"Given the deep structural global roots of the problem, Europe needs to play a leading role in tackling food prices and food security at global level."
"This is already taking place through a number of international organisations and programmes such as FAO and the World Food Programme, as well as through more general forums such as the G20."
"I would just like to add that, on a personal level, this debate has reinforced my long-standing conviction that, to tackle global challenges, such as hunger in the world, volatility of food and raw material prices, turbulence on the financial markets, regulation of financial products and services, there is a need for much more global governance and more global rule-making."
"Europe, based upon its unique experiences with governance and rule-making, does have a very special mission and responsibility here."
"It is for this reason that we believe that Europe and the European Union have to take a leading role in combating all these challenges."
"The Hungarian Presidency is pleased to note that it can count on Parliament to maintain the work being made by the EU, both in terms of policy and of efforts at international level."
"To wind up the debate, six motions for resolutions have been tabled under Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 February 2011."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"Global food security is a crucial issue for the European Union."
"Immediate and sustained action must be taken to guarantee the food security of the citizens of the EU and the planet as a whole."
"It is essential to develop sustainable agriculture in developing countries and to allocate an appropriate share of EU development aid to the agricultural sector."
"The spectacular reduction in the level of development aid allocated to agriculture since the 1980s is regrettable, and it is to be hoped that recognition of this need will reverse this trend."
"The European Commission really must give priority to agriculture in its development aid, particularly aid to allow farmers to gain access to markets and aid to small and medium-sized family farms."
"Humanitarian food aid must respond to the needs, challenges and structural limitations of developing countries, with account being taken of production, distribution and local transport as well as the trading capacities of these countries, in order to help lay the foundations of their long-term food security."
"in writing. - (GA) Security of food supply is a major concern today."
"There are 79 million people in the EU living below the poverty threshold and during the winter of last year food aid was given to 16 million people in the EU."
"Since the cost of food is at a new high level for the seventh month in a row and since the volatility in prices is creating serious problems in the food chain, more people will have difficulty finding wholesome food at a reasonable cost."
"Common agricultural policy (CAP) programmes, like the Programme for Deprived Persons, are of critical importance for providing food."
"Programmes of this kind must be supported and prompt, long-term measures adopted to ensure security of food supply in the EU and throughout the world."
"Currently 30% of the food produced in the world is wasted."
"This is unacceptable, immoral wastage and must be curbed."
"A strong agricultural industry, a strong CAP and a food supply chain in which every effort is made to curb food wastage are essential for tackling the food supply challenge."
"in writing - (PL) I approve of the fact that the European Parliament has focused on rising food prices."
"Unfortunately, these price rises are not a short-term phenomenon, but seem to be developing into a long-term trend."
"This is compounded by a growing demand for food, notably for cereals, poor harvests in recent years and low stocks, and also unfortunately financial operations and a weakening dollar."
"All this is causing chaos on the markets."
"From our point of view the social consequences are more significant."
"The populations of many countries are growing exponentially, and they are permanently malnourished and hungry."
"Their despair creates a source of increasing political tension."
"We cannot observe these events passively."
"We need international cooperation under the auspices of the UN and the European Union."
"Countries that are members of the G-20 should effectively counteract speculation in agricultural products."
"We should look again at the regulation of agricultural markets in Europe so as not to artificially restrict potential growth."
"There should be no speculation in global hunger as the effect of this speculation will be that many innocent people will die of hunger, especially in the poorest nations."
"During the second half of 2010, the wholesale prices of agricultural produce increased by 32%."
"World grain consumption increased to 41 million tonnes between 2005 and 2010 compared to 21 million tonnes between 1990 and 2004."
"According to various analysts, a substantial food crisis in 2011 is a reality; it would take just a single failed crop."
"The biggest exporting countries Russia, Ukraine, China and Mexico have already been forced to import in order to ensure their supply."
"The reasons for the increase in prices are vague, and one can no longer talk about the trends of the agricultural produce market."
"Recent price increases have been dramatic and unpredictable as a result of various speculations."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the growing use of biofuel is increasingly reducing the share of grain used for animal and human consumption."
"This has caused a very tense situation where we need to realise that increasing food prices lead to a growth in inflation, feed protectionism and cause unrest, all of which could lead to social, economic and political instability in Europe as well as globally."
"Europe, as one of the biggest importers of food products, has a great influence on global food prices, but that equally makes it vulnerable to various price shocks."
"I support the endeavours of the European Commission to accept a new legislative package by spring 2011 which would give the Commission greater authority to regulate markets and prevent speculation."
"The European Union must find means to ensure sustainable prices and a sustainable economy."
"A balance needs to be established between security and openness as well as development."
"We must be ready to face a potential crisis."
"The current high prices are a good thing for some people and a bad thing for others."
"For example, they benefit wheat farmers in the EU, but not animal-based food producers."
"They benefit countries with cereals available for export, but they create a deadlock and hunger for the people in developing countries who depend on cereal imports for their food."
"Of course, the final outcome may differ from one area to another and/or from one producer to another."
"That is because, concealed behind each group of winners and losers are problems in the agrofood chain in the EU, the threat of climate change to food security and the deadlocks created by superficial and inconsistent choices in connection with production, trade and development."
"The EU must find realistic and balanced solutions, by evaluating the conditions calmly and seriously, with a sense of its role on the international markets."
"The CAP reform must help in this direction."
"in writing. - (HU) The steep rise in food prices is caused by the simultaneous effect of three factors: the loss of yields caused by natural disasters, the growing demand for food, especially on the part of China and India, and commodity exchange activities, that is, price speculation."
"French President Nicolas Sarkozy raised a very pertinent question a couple of weeks ago: If money markets are regulated, why aren't commodity markets?"
"We must take action against speculation far more effectively at both EU and global level."
"The main cause of the food price shock has been the tremendous fluctuation in supply."
"Only 10-20% of cereals change hands on the global market, and yet a reduction in production can result in a state of panic."
"Based on forecasts of diminishing supplies, importers drive up prices."
"It is not fair towards either the producers or the consumers that internal prices, too, are determined by export prices, since at least 80% of production is used where it has been produced."
"Russia, in its former position as an exporter, and currently as an importer, has been a fundamental influence on the European cereal and oil seed market."
"The supply shock is further exacerbated by speculation on the futures markets, resulting in a food price shock."
"The main problem is therefore not caused by a physical lack of food, but by food prices the poor can no longer afford."
"This results in foodstuffs remaining in storage instead of being sold at equitable prices."
"High prices have a debilitating effect on consumers, in particular those in the poor strata of society."
"We are discussing a problem that is above all a political issue requiring a vision for the future."
"However, much more than short-term remedies, what is needed is the courage to establish a new architecture that reconciles the need to increase food production by 70% in the next 40 years with the increasingly limited natural resources."
"Therefore, what is done or not done in Africa, in Asia, in the Americas or in Europe affects everyone, everywhere, with consequences for availability, for access and for food prices."
"This is severely affecting the poor, as well as producers of meat and milk."
"That is why the response must be global and goes far beyond the field of agricultural policy: it is essential to invoke a set of other policies, without which we will not truly be achieving the necessary solutions."
"At global level, these solutions include advocating food as a right, supporting the countries' abilities to feed themselves, supporting farmers and ensuring their fair access to value in the food chain, limiting financial speculation, protecting access to land, and creating food reserves."
"in writing. - (FI) People's right to adequate nutrition is a human right that has been acknowledged in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights since 1948."
"We should therefore remember that when we discuss the price of food, in fact we are talking about fundamental human rights."
"The reform of the European Union's common agricultural policy is taking place at the same time as a rise in global market prices for food."
"If we are to respond to these changes in a sustainable way, based on human rights, we will need a comprehensive outlook and policy."
"The price of food and food price trends are affected by several critical issues in global agriculture, such as climate change, energy policy, and the availability of natural resources and how efficiently they are used."
"The European Union should be a pioneer for a new way of thinking about agriculture."
"We need a food policy in which whole elements of the entire food production chain are assessed critically and its effects on health and the environment are taken into account."
"A more natural and resourceefficient food policy needs to be supported and guided by means of both economic and policy measures."
"Speculation on food prices should furthermore be restricted."
"Michel Barnier, Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, has proposed new measures to curb speculation on basic commodities in the derivatives market."
"Barnier has the right idea."
"The dramatic fluctuations in the price of food are harming farmers, consumers and even entire national economies."
"Commitments made in the derivatives market must be made more transparent and subject to greater monitoring, and, if necessary, restrictions on trading using the price of food should be introduced."
"The creation of a sustainable food policy is at present one of the most important issues for the European Union."
"According to a statement from the World Bank, food prices have risen by over 15% since October 2010, and the price of grain, for example, has risen at an annual rate of 39%, according to the FAO."
"Not only does an increase in food prices threaten the lowest income groups, but it also reveals much deeper and more serious problems that will pose a major threat in the future."
"Global food production is threatened by a number of factors, such as pests, diseases and natural disasters."
"These factors are currently being exacerbated by extreme weather conditions that are probably due to climate change."
"A good example of this would be the drought and fires in Russia in 2010, or the floods in Pakistan, and more recently in Australia."
"We can expect the problem of rising food prices to get worse in the future."
"It is pointless to discuss the causes of climate change here, because the risks are real and to doubt them is an unacceptable gamble."
"However, food prices are also affected by economic factors, especially abuse of the market system through government manipulation of the US dollar exchange rate and irresponsible speculation in commodity trading."
"Europe must realise that decisions made now will affect the future of the whole food system."
"In the short term, we can focus on minimising food waste, decreasing dependence on imports, reducing or stabilising demand, and establishing regulatory mechanisms on the market in order to prevent speculation."
"In view of current political conflicts, the fact that food prices are at their highest level since records began is a more pressing problem than ever."
"At the end of the day, this is a matter of food supply, and in developing countries it is a question of the essential supply of basic foods."
"The European Union is called on to speed up the progress of the global fight against poverty and hunger - there are around 1.4 billion people suffering extreme poverty."
"Poverty is an issue within European borders, too."
"The only means of guaranteeing food supply in Europe is through the European common agricultural policy."
"The challenges faced by agriculture are huge and they encourage the tendency to produce 'more from less'."
"Higher food prices will not automatically be reflected in higher incomes for farmers; the gap between producer and consumer prices is widening."
"The reality of price management is complex: scarce raw materials, higher production costs, high fuel prices, dependency on harvests, exports and the world market - a dense network of causes that have to be disentangled by means of targeted measures."
"In order to tackle these causes, measures and agreement across all policy areas are urgently needed."
"I call on the Commission to make fundamental progress in strengthening agricultural production in Europe and in the developing countries."
"Speculation on our most vital goods is unethical and we must take stronger action in this regard."
"Food prices have been rising significantly in recent years, not so much because of the laws of supply and demand, but above all because of speculation."
"The fact is that these increases primarily affect poorer people who have to spend more than half their income on food."
"It is unacceptable some should profit from the hunger of others, whether in Europe or in developing countries."
"Citizens have a right to food security, a precondition of which is access to healthy food for all."
"Food shortages have a number of causes: examples include, inter alia, the wrong spatial planning and agricultural support policies, and climate change."
"It is therefore crucial that the EU support farmers in cultivating their land and producing the necessary food products."
"It is unacceptable that consumers should pay a lot and producers earn little, while speculators reap the rewards."
"Climate change must also be an EU priority in the interest of food security."
"in writing. - (LV) The last few months have seen a sharp rise in food prices, as a result of which the number of people living on the margins of poverty has rapidly increased."
"The situation in Europe is not so critical, as our citizens' incomes are incomparably greater than those in developing countries."
"Nevertheless, our voters too are becoming aware of increasing food prices."
"According to World Bank statistics, around 44 million people in developing countries have fallen into poverty since last June, since food prices at the beginning of 2011 have reached the 2008 level, when rising food and oil prices had a significantly adverse effect on poverty throughout the world."
"Of course, the price of oil in the world has an effect on food prices, but we should still remember that in the summer of 2008, oil was standing at USD 140 a barrel, whereas today it costs about USD 100, which means that the rise in prices has been partly caused by speculation."
"In order to avoid such situations in the future, the G20 countries must develop a mechanism to prevent such a price rise and speculation in foodstuffs."
"In order to achieve this, we must have joint working at an international level."
"The problem posed by variable food prices is further proof that we need a powerful common agricultural policy that is fair and provides a level playing field for all European farmers, so that our population can obtain good-quality food of high value at acceptable prices."
"in writing. - (LT) On the subject of food prices, I would like to draw attention to two areas."
"Firstly, as recent experience in my country shows, by manipulating public opinion a little it is very easy to influence rising food prices."
"Due to resellers the price of sugar rose by more than 10% in one day in the whole of Lithuania."
"Therefore we cannot leave everyday foodstuffs to self-regulation."
"They may be considered an investment, the management of which requires specific knowledge that the growers of agricultural products (farmers) do not possess."
"Although the free movement of goods is one of the fundamental principles of the functioning of the EU free market, it is necessary to take more stringent measures both at Member State and EU levels, to restrict speculation in foodstuffs and defend the rights of the weaker half - consumers, small-scale farmers and traders - in relations with large processors and shopping centres."
"The second dimension is the close link between food products and energy sources and the interrelationship between their prices."
"On the one hand, in order to combat gas emissions that are driving climate change, we promote the use of biofuel (and have even set obligatory quotas for its use)."
"On the other hand, the growing on agricultural land of plants intended for biofuel, rather than products intended for food, is precisely the thing that is driving up food prices."
"Thus, although combating climate change is one of our priority objectives, we must find a means of not influencing the prices of foodstuffs, for instance, only land that will never be suitable for growing agricultural products should be used for biofuel."
"The resolution on rising food prices addresses the finding that food prices are steadily increasing."
"It is because of this increase that we are calling for urgent measures to combat price manipulation."
"Climatic phenomena are one particularly noteworthy cause of this increase; in other words, better water and soil management are needed."
"The direct impact on the world's population of an increase in food prices, which could provoke riots and unrest, must also encourage the G20 leaders to come to an agreement on market measures to combat speculation."
"Situation in Egypt (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Egypt."
"Commissioner Füle will take the floor on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, it is my pleasure to be here with you today."
"As you are certainly aware, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission is visiting the southern Mediterranean at the moment and has asked me to address you on her behalf on the events in Egypt."
"The political reality of Egypt changed spectacularly last Friday when President Mubarak stepped down after 30 years in office."
"His departure has opened the way to the possible transformation of Egypt."
"Let me repeat this in front of this House: the European Union salutes the courage of the Egyptian people who have pursued their struggle for democratic change peacefully and with dignity."
"A great responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the Supreme Military Council to guide Egypt towards the democratic future for which its people have striven."
"We have taken good note of the commitments to revise the Constitution, to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, to honour international treaties and obligations and to limit military rule to six months."
"There are already reports on the first steps taken."
"The proposal for a constitutional amendment should be delivered within ten days and submitted to popular vote within two months."
"We will closely watch the steps that are taken and we hope they will pave the way towards democratic, free and fair elections later in the year."
"The European Union responded to the events in Egypt as soon as the public protests escalated."
"We repeatedly called on the Egyptian authorities to ensure an immediate transition and to respond to the democratic ambitions of the people."
"The High Representative contacted directly the Egyptian Vice-President Omar Suleiman when concerns of rising violence or human rights abuses arose."
"The European Union immediately expressed its readiness to lend full support to Egypt's transition process towards democracy."
"The European Council asked the High Representative to develop a package of measures supporting the transformation process in Egypt and Tunisia."
"She was also asked, together with the Commission, to adapt European Union instruments to stimulate the transition and the country's economic and social development."
"We have started work on how we can best support Egypt and we are aiming at the kind of joined-up foreign policy response that the Treaty of Lisbon allows."
"In doing so, we are listening to all voices, including those of the Members of this House."
"You have a crucial contribution to make as democratically elected representatives and also as an arm of the budgetary authority."
"The High Representative and I will also report on this process to the Foreign Affairs Council in a few days' time."
"I would like to add at this point that High Representative Ashton has convened a special session of the Foreign Affairs Council for this Sunday."
"In Egypt, as in Tunisia, the European Union is unequivocally supportive of the transformation process that has started."
"There is, however, an important difference."
"In the case of Tunisia, the political situation has become a little clearer."
"We have managed to establish a dialogue with the transitional government on the needs of the country and the possible European Union response."
"The High Representative has been in close contact throughout with international leaders to discuss the challenges facing the region and to ensure a coordinated and, therefore, strong international response."
"We will first seek to adjust our ongoing programmes to support the aspirations of the Egyptian people for reforms as and when matters clarify."
"The European Union already has a wide portfolio of programmes in place in Egypt and spends close to EUR 150 million a year there."
"For several years, we have been financing projects on democratic reforms, good governance and respect for human rights."
"EUR 40 million were allocated to this objective in 2007-2010 and EUR 50 million are planned for 2011-2013."
"We also have more funds mobilised, in particular for civil society, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"The new situation in Egypt should create the right environment to put these funds to maximum use and push forward the implementation of much more ambitious programmes than was possible in the past."
"Beyond the existing programmes and funds, we intend to listen to the Egyptians and hear where they consider the country needs our support most."
"Their demands, in terms of democracy, social and economic perspectives and free, fair and inclusive elections, must be met."
"The European Union stands ready to support this reform process based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The Egyptian authorities have already approached us with initial requests, including on dealing with suspicions of the misappropriation of public funds."
"We are coordinating with Member States on this and the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to address this issue."
"As and when other requests come, we will do our utmost to be responsive and mobilise our expertise on democratisation, elections, human rights, economic and social reforms, as well as any other issues where Egyptians may see a need."
"However, let me be clear."
"It is not for us to dictate outcomes or impose solutions."
"The future lies firmly in the hands of the people of Egypt."
"I mentioned at the beginning that the High Representative and Vice-President is travelling in the region as we speak."
"She was willing to visit Egypt as part of her trip and she expressed that will to her Egyptian counterparts."
"She has now been invited to Cairo by the Egyptian authorities and will travel there on Monday evening, after the Foreign Affairs Council."
"This will be an opportunity for her to listen to the Egyptians and to assess the priority needs of the country on the road to democracy."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Mubarak has disappeared from the scene and everyone seems to have breathed a sigh of relief."
"Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future."
"However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves."
"The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties."
"The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy."
"Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner."
"We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days."
"Returning to the Commissioner's speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU's image, it appears that things are back on track."
"Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense."
"Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause."
"We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights."
"This could also be extended to the entire EU."
"Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results."
"The EU's image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players."
"However, the EU's appeal remains intact."
"I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, for years the Euro-Atlantic players thought that Islam could not possibly produce democratic behaviour and institutions."
"Therefore, they opted for either supporting authoritarian regimes or mechanically transferring the Western model of democracy to the Arab countries."
"Not only did both strategies fail, but they are responsible for the emergence of Islamic fundamentalists and the alienation of secular parts of the civil society."
"The present events in Egypt prove that Islam need not only be fundamentalist, but that it can also be democratic if we accept that democracy may have a variable geometry, and if we let it grow naturally from its specific soil."
"At the same time, we must admit that the popular uprising was on one hand the result of the evolution of Egyptian elites in the cyber or Internet society, and on the other hand the consequence of the existential hardships brought on by the global economic crisis."
"If the European Union does not immediately and consistently address the need to overcome these hardships, the revolution might move towards anarchy; and from there towards another dictatorship."
"Finally, we must not only applaud the fact that no Israeli flags were burnt during the recent events in Egypt, but also observe that the lack of a long-due solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the origin of the feeling of failure which upset Arab society and fuelled its neurosis."
"Therefore, the European Union should immediately take the initiative in order to use the transformation in Egypt - which today is a mere hope - and turn it into a real opportunity for internal democracy and regional peace."
"In this context, the trips of the High Representative/Vice-President to the region, and her readiness to adapt and upgrade the necessary European instruments to cope with the challenges, are good news."
"Her action must be supported by all of us."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Mr Cohn-Bendit and myself we were very critical of Baroness Ashton two weeks ago, and I see that Mr Severin has adapted his language slightly and is speaking more boldly."
"This intervention was absolutely necessary two weeks ago because the European Union had taken a wishy-washy attitude."
"It is clear that the situation in Egypt demands three things: first of all, the Commission has to come forward with a credible and global plan for Tunisia and for Egypt - how to strengthen civil society, what to do to fight corruption, how to help in building democratic institutions, how to create an independent justice system and how to help economic construction and development."
"These are questions not of millions, Commissioner, but of billions."
"I think you will have to come forward as fast as possible with a global plan."
"Secondly, yesterday our group had a videoconference with Dr Ayman Nour, one of the leading opposition leaders in Egypt, and there are a number of concerns."
"In all this debate in Egypt on the change of the constitution, I can tell you that the secular democratic political parties are not involved for the moment and that is a message to give."
"Secondly, to deal with this in two months and to organise elections in two months is a non-starter, because it means that we will not have normal political parties there participating in this."
"Then there is the whole question of the proportional representation or an individual representation system there."
"I sent a message to High Representative Ashton to ask that, in her contacts on Monday, she raise these three questions that are fundamental for a real democratic society in Egypt in the near future."
"I think that Parliament should back her in these three claims and hope that she expressed these three elements, these three concerns, in her contacts in Egypt."
"Thirdly, Commissioner, this is not the end."
"We see things happening in Bahrain, in Yemen, in Algeria, in Iran, in Libya, in Morocco and in Kuwait."
"What we also need now is a bold message from the High Representative on what is happening in these countries; we should not wait until a number of things have happened."
"On these issues we also need a clear communication from the Commission, and mainly from Baroness Ashton, on what is happening in these countries, expressing our support for the masses in those countries."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that we are, indeed, faced with several issues."
"The first issue, which will not be resolved in two weeks, is that the Commission is wondering what a realpolitik means in a climate that has existed for years in the Mediterranean region and perhaps elsewhere."
"In other words, what kind of relationships can and should the European Union have with these dictatorships and what form should they take."
"For it is all rather extraordinary."
"Today everyone says that Mr Mubarak was a dictator."
"I did not hear that a month ago in the European Parliament."
"He was not a dictator then."
"So if you wish to freeze assets, do not simply freeze the assets of Mr Mubarak's friends, but freeze those of Mr Mubarak and his family, as you did in Mr Ben Ali's case; you did not just freeze the assets of Mr Ben Ali's entourage."
"Secondly, I believe that what we are seeing today in Egypt and Tunisia is a democratic tsunami."
"What did we do when a tsunami claimed scores of victims?"
"We mobilised exceptional funds precisely to help the peoples affected."
"We must now mobilise exceptional funds to help the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt, because the reasons behind the revolt were primarily hunger and poverty, and if this poverty is not alleviated during the democratic transition, there is the danger that some of the protestors will join the ranks, for example, of the fundamentalists and the hardliners."
"We cannot delay."
"I therefore believe that the Commission should offer a substantial package to Tunisia and Egypt and say that democracy is a good thing, because it also brings funding."
"At the same time, I do not think that a trip by Baroness Ashton is sufficient as things stand today."
"There must be a special envoy, because we must continue discussions with the committees."
"For example, in Tunisia and Egypt, the committees re-drafting the constitution do not include members of the opposition parties or women."
"There are only men, even though women took part in the demonstrations."
"We must therefore support this process, and I believe that the Commission should do as it did in the past for the East, and offer its help with any constitutional aspects needed - in other words, it must be present on a political, legal and economic level."
"I have one last point."
"On the subject of this region, you are aware that discussions are currently taking place on the technical upgrading of the association agreements with Israel."
"I do not think that this is the right solution."
"I do not think that this is the right signal to send out."
"Israel must be protected, but the policy of everyone in that region, including the Israeli Government, must be reviewed."
"This is not about calling Israel into question, but rather the policy of its government."
"To gift Israel today with the technical upgrading of the association agreement would send out a bad signal to the entire region."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, during the first thirty years of Israel's existence, Egypt was its implacable foe."
"For the past thirty years, the two countries have, mercifully, been at peace."
"It is hard to overemphasise how important the Camp David accords are to Israel's security."
"Israelis are really afraid that the radical Muslim Brotherhood will indeed fill the vacuum created by the Egyptian revolution."
"It is bad enough that Israel faces the terrorist threat of Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, the fanatics of Hamas launching rockets from Gaza and the existentialist threat from a nuclear-armed Iran."
"However, an Islamist takeover in Egypt would almost certainly result in the revocation of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty and the opening of the Rafah border to Hamas."
"The EU should make our help conditional on preserving the peace treaty, and not countenance supporting any political developments in Egypt that threaten the security of our strategic ally."
"Supporting a democratic Egypt is incredibly important for us, and the economic challenges are massive."
"I fully support the idea of mobilising loan finance from the EIB and EBRD, as suggested by the High Representative yesterday in the Financial Times."
"Our political parties and groups in Europe must also help set up secular, pluralist, democratic sister parties in Egypt to compete freely in elections in six months time, when the military will hopefully leave power."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(HU) Mr President, I cannot help but ask my fellow Member how balanced he thinks the picture he provided about Israel and the situation in the Middle East is, considering that he did not say one word about the gross violations of human rights committed by the state of Israel, including its disgraceful attack on Gaza, the so-called Security Fence, which has nothing to do with security, or all those human rights violations, which have been condemned by the UN and several other organisations and human rights groups."
"Mr President, this debate is about how we helped Egypt."
"Of course, I emphasise the need to also help our strategic ally, Israel."
"I do not need to debate now why Israel is our ally, why it shares our common democratic values, why the security wall has actually reduced terrorist attacks and suicide bombers by over 90%, or why Israel has a free press and has free elections, unlike any of its neighbours."
"That is a debate for another time."
"All I am saying at this stage is that the peace treaty with Israel is essential for regional stability and security and, of course, you must remember that the EU is a very big player within the Quartet."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Füle, the European Union has a very serious problem with its neighbourhood policy, which must be corrected."
"We have shifted from our necessary tutelage over the Mubarak and Ben Ali regimes -a collaborative approach which as I say was necessary- to a situation in which we are now seeking to decry these dictatorships and also seeking to have a degree of tutelage over the revolutionary process for democratic change staged by some sections of civil society."
"The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt have something in common."
"The protesters are very young, the role of political organisations has been negligible -although this has not been the case with trade unions- and both revolutions are demanding a democratic welfare state, with religion completely out of the picture, which is something we should rejoice in."
"However, our neighbourhood policy has been lacking in credibility."
"One cannot play a necessary collaborative role towards two dictatorships one day only to revile them the next day and seek to have tutelage over the Egyptian constitutional reforms, which will shape the future state."
"Mr Füle, we fail to understand why Article 2 of the association agreements has never been implemented."
"Clause 2 has never been implemented."
"Not in Egypt, not in Tunisia, not in Morocco, not in Israel."
"Never."
"This clause is a key element of the association agreements, yet it has never been implemented."
"Its terms are very clear: any countries signing association agreements with the European Union must observe international law and human rights."
"This key clause has never been put into practice, it has never been activated."
"Therefore, we do not share this philosophy whereby free trade takes precedence over human rights in the Mediterranean region."
"This is what needs to be changed, Mr Füle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fall of President Mubarak has paved the way for democracy, but it is also a tremendous opportunity to liberate the Egyptian people."
"The reform of the country's democratic institutions will allow for, amongst other things, further development of the economy and the possibility of spreading prosperity to all members of society, even the weakest."
"Without democracy, economic development will serve only to enrich a few families, as has always been the way in countries that have no social justice."
"European policy must therefore support Egypt as it embarks on reforms and help the Egyptian people to choose their own future unaided."
"On the other hand, we must be clear with the future government of Cairo and emphasise that a new and more generous partnership policy will be conditional upon regional security and peace with Israel."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it is only natural for revolutionary events to be accompanied by a great deal of emotion."
"However, as Europeans standing on the outside, we should guard against such emotion and keep in view the reality of the situation."
"If we now generally rejoice at the bursting out of democracy in Egypt or even in Tunisia, then we are ignoring reality."
"The reality is that we have a military regime in Egypt, which - we hope - is only a transitional regime, and in Tunisia there is a regime that is not in a position to keep thousands or tens of thousands of people from emigrating illegally."
"Europeans must, of course, be the friends of the peoples and the allies of freedom."
"However, with the future in mind we must also act accordingly in relation to regimes and dictatorships that are still firmly in place in other Arab countries."
"I believe that we can only do so if we are under no illusions and if we help these peoples to develop what is needed for democracy: the rule of law, a free market economy and the structures that are required for democracy to even be conceivable."
"(The speaker agreed to take a question under the 'blue-card' procedure (Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure))"
"(DE) Mr Mölzer, do you think it is in good taste for the EU currently to be negotiating with Colonel Gaddafi over the return of refugees when there have been 40 people injured in demonstrations in Libya today?"
"Do you think it is better, together with the dictator, to now force the refugees to return?"
"Do you think that is in good taste?"
"(DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, you heard me say that the EU must take a position with regard to dictators that are still in power and are currently still accepted partners of the European Union, and we should do so before revolutionary changes occur in the countries concerned with regard to human rights, democratisation and the rule of law."
"However, democratisation in these countries does not really provide grounds for asylum and if democracy now breaks out there it must also be possible for the people to be able to stay there."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, there is something we need to recognise and it is something that we have not yet learnt, namely that we often have to work with undemocratic regimes because many countries in this world are ruled by dictators."
"In so doing, however, we must not forget to work together with civil society."
"We need to do that in order both to support human rights and to develop democracy."
"My second point is that we need to recognise that stability is not the only decisive factor."
"Real stability will only come about if we support freedom."
"If we do not seize the opportunity now and provide assistance to the courageous people in these countries, there is a risk that we will then find ourselves in a vacuum and unable to bring about a change - a wind of change - as we did in 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe, but instead we will see a situation like that of Iran in 1979."
"Providing assistance now also means stability and security for us - freedom and stability go hand in hand."
"I am therefore thankful that, after the difficulties during the start-up phase of our new service, the External Action Service and the Commission are clearly now making progress and coming up with sensible proposals."
"In this regard, it is important that we not only improve and enhance our assistance from a structural point of view, but also offer - whether our offers are accepted is up to the people there - to help these countries to build democratic structures so that they are in a position to enter into a democratic contest and so that the democrats win the elections and not, at the end of the day, those people who are perhaps organised by a military regime or the Muslim Brotherhood."
"In this regard, we need to be more courageous and perhaps set out our programmes in a slightly more intelligent way than we have done in the past."
"I hope that we are on the right track here."
"If we achieve this, we will no longer make many of the mistakes of the past and we ought to use this to seize an opportunity for ourselves."
"(NL) Mr President, Mubarak may have gone, but that can only be an intermediate step."
"Many other measures are needed, and the army, which is now holding the reins of power, must find a credible way of guiding the transition process which has already started."
"That means lifting martial law and involving all democratic forces in the steps that are now being taken."
"Drawing up a new constitution will be the first important test, in that respect."
"For its part, the European Union should employ all possible means, direct and indirect, to guide that process."
"Amongst other things, that will, indeed, mean helping democratic parties and civil society to develop."
"It also means freezing the assets of those who have misused state funds."
"Obviously - and this will be much harder and will require more work - we need to adopt a package of economic support measures, because the transition can only really be judged to be a success when the economy has picked up."
"Finally, we have indeed noted that the democracy clauses which are in place, but which are not being applied, have proved unsuccessful."
"They will therefore have to be evaluated."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the course of a revolution is seldom predictable."
"That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91."
"It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution."
"It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer."
"Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish."
"However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election."
"It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections."
"However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom."
"I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments."
"That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means."
"What does it mean?"
"Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean?"
"We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies."
"(PL) - Mr President, once once again, Parliament is debating the situation in Egypt which is dynamic and requires monitoring."
"In the meantime, the President of Egypt has resigned, but this has not lessened the fear of destabilisation in this country and the whole region."
"The threat that power may be seized by extremist elements still exists."
"Previously, I suggested that Parliament and the Commission should send a special observation mission to Egypt, and now we should grant this delegation the power to make decisions."
"At stake is not only support for free elections, but also the provision of an emergency aid package, especially in view of the fact that the Egyptians themselves are appealing for financial aid for Egypt."
"A deepening of the existing crisis could lead to the growth of unrest and anti-democratic feeling."
"For the steps taken to be effective there should be consultation with diplomats from the United States, who are actively engaged in the politics of this region."
"(NL) Mr President, an appalling lack of political freedom, coupled with a harrowing socio-economic situation, has led to weeks of mass demonstrations and the eventual resignation of President Mubarak."
"The word on the streets of Cairo was that only one Egyptian citizen was actually still adhering to the curfew: Hosni Mubarak."
"However, witty remarks alone will not improve the average standard of living of the Egyptian people."
"That will definitely be one of the first tasks of Mubarak's successors, if they wish to avoid the risk of the explosion of a new wave of protests."
"At the same time, we are still waiting for the internal democratisation process to get off the ground."
"Ensuring the peaceful unfolding of that process will be of great importance, not just to Egyptian civilian society itself, but also to the region as a whole."
"I welcome any assistance which the European Union can provide for this double transition process, and that also applies to the vulnerable position of the Copts and the continuity of Egyptian-Israeli relations."
"(NL) Mr President, now that the dust has settled in Egypt, it is time we opened our eyes to what is really happening in North Africa."
"Many of the protesters are seeking, not democracy, but the imposition of sharia."
"'Allah akbar' was a slogan which was often heard during the protests."
"Journalists were harassed, a Dutch correspondent was threatened with death and the saddest thing of all is that the splendid American journalist Lara Logan was sexually abused by a mob."
"The ayatollahs behind dictator Ahmadinejad and Al Qaida must be having a field day."
"The Muslim Brotherhood can now continue their holy war against Israel and the West."
"I call on our members not to be naïve today."
"The Egyptians are facing an important choice."
"Will the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood come to power, or will Egypt get a secular government?"
"Under sharia law, Coptic Christians, apostate Muslims, women and gays will have no decent future in Egypt."
"If the Muslim Brotherhood's Islamists have their way, Israel will once again be the target of violence."
"The only fair position that we can adopt today must be: Egyptians, choose freedom, not sharia!"
"Islam and democracy do not mix."
"The new Egyptian constitution must not be given over to sharia."
"Imams should not be allowed to control politics."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom has the guts to say that out loud."
"Do Parliament and the European Commission have the guts to say that today?"
"That is the question we must answer today."
"Mr President, the departure of Hosni Mubarak signals the transition towards a pluralist democracy responding to the aspirations of the Egyptian people."
"The Egyptian armed forces now have the responsibility of leading their country, in a short period of time, towards genuine democracy, the rule of law with an independent judiciary, good governance and accountability on suspected cases of corruption."
"The military leadership is cautioned not to disappoint the youth, who were at the forefront of the demonstrations and whose representatives should be called upon to play their role in building democracy during the transition."
"The message of Egypt is a message for the whole Arab world."
"The Arab countries are our partners; we have no intention of patronising them or imposing anything from the outside."
"However, the message for them, as sent by the Egyptians and the Tunisians, is: 'Reform and reform now."
