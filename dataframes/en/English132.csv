"The most important matter is what we, MEPs, can do in the next few weeks to improve the situation."
"However, since in the first hours and days, the greatest responsibility rests with the executive, I would like to thank the representatives both of the Council and of the Commission for being with us."
"I would like to assure the Council of Ministers and the Spanish Presidency, and please tell them about this, that the European Parliament is ready to cooperate at any moment, and that we are open to discussing these matters in committee."
"We are open to receiving representatives of the European Commission and the Council and to discussing these problems."
"We want to be involved in this."
"We are from the different regions of the European Union, we were chosen in direct elections, and are responsible for the residents of the Union, and so our involvement is essential."
"We are ready for this."
"Of course, we can only do what is possible for a legislative authority to do."
"We cannot make executive decisions, but we want to help both the Commission and the Council."
"We are open to this. That is why we are having this discussion."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (NL) Mr President, thank you to the Commission and the Council for the information you have given us about the crisis in European aviation."
"What has become clear over the past few days is that, without aviation, not only does our Parliament run into difficulties, but our European cooperation and our economy faces huge problems, too."
"That is why it is important that we are having this emergency debate in Parliament today."
"Passengers have been stranded, airlines, the travel industry and companies which depend on air travel have all been hit hard, and all this comes on top of the economic crisis."
"Safety is paramount."
"Let there be no misunderstanding about that."
"Passengers have to be transported safely, but it is clear that we were not sufficiently prepared for this exceptional situation."
"The closing of airspace on the first day was a swift response to a problem with which we, in Europe, have, until now, been unfamiliar, a volcanic ash cloud."
"But what happened in the days following this?"
"The computer models showed us that we ought not to fly, but the test flights went ahead without any problems."
"Let me reiterate that, while safety must, of course, come first, it is important that we reopen European airspace on the basis of facts and correct assumptions."
"It is necessary that we carry out more work, tailored to our specific circumstances."
"The good thing is that the first steps towards that were taken yesterday and we have to build on that quickly."
"We have to take decisive action."
"Safety first, but we also have to make sure that we can again use the safe zones very soon."
"In addition, we need structural measures."
"The single European sky, which has given rise to so much resistance amongst the Member States, is something which could also help us make aviation more effective."
"Airlines have suffered huge economic damage."
"High costs were incurred, not only through the grounding of air traffic itself, but also because assistance had to be provided to stranded passengers."
"Insurance companies are not providing any cover and it is questionable whether we can justify all the costs falling on the shoulders of the airlines."
"I therefore urge you to investigate the scale of the costs incurred, the scale of the damage suffered and what compensation might perhaps be provided."
"To give you an example: the costs incurred by the airlines, based on our European directive on passenger rights, and what disaster assistance is payable."
"Is it not the obvious step to ascertain whether, in this case of force majeure, we could actually pay that out of the European budget?"
"Commissioner Almunia, you have indicated that you would be favourably inclined to the provision of State aid, but I must warn you that we must prevent the Member States sponsoring their national champions."
"It is therefore extremely important that we coordinate this at a European level."
"Not only the State aid framework, but also the effective provision of State aid."
"That is what I call on you to ensure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this crisis has a human dimension which we will definitely have to discuss today."
"A lot of people, tens of thousands of them, are stranded all over the world and waiting to come home."
"I believe that we should be thinking about these people this morning."
"Almost all of us, many of the Members of this House, have had similar experiences in recent weeks."
"We are privileged Members of the European Parliament, who can make use of the available infrastructure."
"However, many people are stranded in far-flung corners of the world."
"They are unable to leave and get back to their jobs, their children cannot go to school, because they have not been able to come back from their holidays, and they are stuck without accommodation and without any money."
"I would like to say once again that my sympathy this morning is with these people."
"I hope that it will be possible to get them home quickly."
"Airlines are a vital part of our transport system, not only for passengers, but also for goods."
"The financial losses caused by this volcanic eruption are significantly greater than those resulting from the events of 11 September 2001."
"This is why I am calling on the Commission to take a flexible approach to authorising domestic aid for airlines that are at risk, if aid of this kind really has to be provided."
"Finally, we need to be aware that air travel is one part of the very vulnerable infrastructure which we have in Europe."
"If air travel is no longer possible, we are not in a position to compensate adequately for its absence."
"This is why I believe that the project which we started 20 years ago, the expansion of the trans-European networks and, in particular, the expansion of rail transport, is a credible and significant alternative and, as we are now seeing, an alternative which is vital to our economic survival."
"It is important that we now acknowledge this fact once again."
"My colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, will be covering other aspects of this issue, but I would just like to say one thing."
"We have not yet succeeded in bringing about the interoperability of trains between different countries."
"It is not possible for a German intercity express to bring German people back from Spain and, in the same way, a French high-speed train cannot travel as far as Budapest."
"This means that we are still not in the position that we should have reached."
"Although we have made appropriate resolutions in Parliament, I am of the opinion that we do not need these sudden periodic bursts of action."
"Instead, we must adopt a sustained, ongoing approach to putting these new concepts into effect."
"Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, in this case, we have seen that nature really is more powerful than any of the technologies available to us."
"To a certain extent, we have been taught a lesson."
"However, at the same time, it is important to note that this situation has shown us that we have not made as much progress in Europe as we should have done."
"For 20 years, we have been talking about an internal market for transport and a single European sky."
"This would, of course, not have prevented the volcanic eruption, but it would perhaps have allowed us to act more effectively and more quickly."
"We have been calling for a single European sky, coordinated by Eurocontrol, for a long time, but it is still not in place."
"In just the same way, and here I am moving in the same direction as Mr Schulz, we still do not have interoperability on the rail network."
"It is still not possible to buy a rail ticket which will take you from northern Europe to the south, travelling right across the continent."
"In this case, too, it becomes clear that we have a great deal down on paper and have discussed many of the issues, but in reality, a lot of what is needed is missing."
"It is obvious that the response in Europe was unsatisfactory from the point of view of the citizens."
"Of course, the situation was difficult and, of course, it was not possible for the ministers from any of the individual countries to open up their airspace when there were warnings coming from an institute in London that it was not safe to fly."
"At the same time, it was unsatisfactory that no actual measurements were taken using balloons, for example, but that everyone was working with statistical extrapolations."
"Many of the citizens of Europe were annoyed about this."
"The position of the airlines is also understandable."
"They were suffering financially and would have liked to have seen a quicker response."
"The airlines have suffered financial losses and, of course, it is very important that the passengers are brought home as soon as possible."
"We must protect their rights."
"However, it is important for passengers' rights in Europe that transport and travel opportunities are available to them."
"For this reason, I believe that it is vital for our transport system in Europe to have airlines and other transport options in place which passengers can use."
"This means that it is essential for us to consider in more detail how we should deal with this situation, how we can provide support for the airlines during the crisis that the transport sector is already undergoing and how we can maintain and guarantee the mobility of the citizens of Europe, which is a major achievement."
"As far as compensation for damages goes, it is no use us approaching the volcano, because, as we already know, that will not get us anywhere."
"Nature has its own laws, but we have to try to react to them in the interests of the citizens of Europe."
"This is why I think it is a very good thing that a task force is being set up with Mr Kallas as its chair."
"This is very important and we will continue to discuss how we can draw conclusions for the future from this crisis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a fundamental change in mobility in Europe over the last six days."
"The crucial factor in this case was not a serious accident, measures to combat climate change or the high price of aviation fuel."
"On this occasion, nature itself played the decisive role."
"The Icelandic volcano has once again shown the human race the true power of nature."
"We must take a lesson from this for the future."
"The human race is not omnipotent and never will be."
"It is right that the response to this volcanic eruption has come from Europe."
"As the volcanic ash can cause aircraft engines to cut out and can also obscure visibility through aircraft windows, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, Eurocontrol, took a responsible approach and made passenger safety its top priority."
"On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Eurocontrol, to the Transport Ministers who supported Eurocontrol and, in particular, to the German Transport Minister, Peter Ramsauer."
"We should also support the German pilots' union, Cockpit, which has behaved more responsibly than the management of the airlines by refusing to fly under visual flight rules in European airspace, because it believes that this would be irresponsible."
"Either the airspace is safe or it is not."
"Ultimately, it does not matter under which rules planes are flying or under which rules they are crashing."
"Therefore, the Greens would like to denounce in the strongest possible terms the approach of the airlines which wanted to give priority to profit rather than safety."
"We are calling for the European airspace to only be opened again when there is no risk at all."
"We are calling on all politicians not to give in to the pressure exerted by the airlines and not to hand over responsibility for safety to the pilots, for example."
"We have become painfully aware in the last few days of the deficiencies of national and European transport policies over recent decades, which have neglected and, in many cases, are still neglecting, the rail system."
"These policies have focused entirely on air transport."
"Every year, the airlines in Europe are given EUR 14 billion by European taxpayers, because, in contrast to the fuel used by the railways, kerosene is not subject to taxation."
"This puts the airlines' temporary loss of income into perspective."
"However, there is one conclusion which we must draw from all of this."
"The railway is not only the safest means of transport; it is also essential for safeguarding mobility and stopping climate change."
"Therefore, I would like to thank all the rail companies in Europe which have helped to get passengers to their destinations."
"The volcanic eruption in Iceland should be a warning to all of us."
"What we are now experiencing is the reality of the future of transport."
"However, transport will only have a successful future if the necessary measures do not have to be taken overnight."
"For this reason, we are calling on all the Member States of the European Union to change the priorities of national and international transport policy."
"Rail transport must be given priority, not only in words, but also in financial deeds, so that we do not have to experience a situation like this again."
"Mr President, the decision made by the aviation safety authorities not to put passenger safety at risk was absolutely right, even if this meant closing European airspace for several days and involved financial losses for the airlines."
"In my opinion, it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk."
"What does 'at their own risk' actually mean in this case?"
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is considering authorising special State aid for the airlines, which would otherwise be in serious financial difficulties as a result of the current situation."
"We will be talking later about employment in the European Union."
"If the EU and the Member States can at least help to prevent things from getting even worse, this is the right thing to do."
"However, in return for the provision of State aid, the airlines must give a binding undertaking not to make staff cuts or salary cuts."
"They must also guarantee that they will not reduce holiday allowances or deduct pay for the days on which employees were not able to get to work because of the transport situation."
"It is high time that the Commission put in place a permanent common European monitoring system for aviation safety."
"This monitoring system should be specifically designed to prevent social dumping."
"I would like to remind everyone of the State aid given to the banks, which profited from the aid, but did not take a corresponding social approach."
"Competition and the pursuit of profit must not be allowed to take priority over the safety of human lives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, the situation caused by the volcano has been managed in a tardy, inefficient way."
"The first real operational meeting took place yesterday, Monday: the volcano started erupting on Thursday morning; therefore, it has taken four days to reach an operational decision."
"It is true that some restrictions have perhaps been excessive, especially where safety is concerned."
"Why, though, ban flights in Belgium when the cloud was in Norway?"
"Why ban single-engine piston aircraft from flying at an altitude of 500 metres when the ash was above 8 000 metres?"
"Perhaps the rule that was applied was the one that we aviators have known about for years, namely, that the safest flight is the one where the pilot is in the bar and the aircraft is in the hangar."
"However, that is not the way to tackle emergencies, and so I believe that, in view of the obligation to guarantee the safety of passengers and crew, it was a good idea to adopt these measures, but they were just adopted too long after the situation had occurred."
"Therefore, for the future, we will need to take account of safety requirements in the first instance, but also of requirements which, while reconciled precisely with safety, involve not just an indiscriminate ban on flights, but measures that reflect the real situation, not the statistical situation, so that, for the sake of a sector that is vital to the whole economy, we may prevent a repeat of the negative economic consequences and repercussions that we saw when the attack of 11 September 2001 took place, not only for the air transport sector and the tourism sector, but for the economy as a whole."
"I therefore call for swift action, serious action, and action in full knowledge of the facts."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, safety has priority over all other considerations."
"We cannot take the risk of a plane full of passengers suffering engine failure and perhaps, as a result, crashing in a built-up area."
"I would like to remind everyone of the British Airways plane which flew through an ash cloud on its way to New Zealand in 1982 and, in particular, of the serious incident involving a KLM Boeing 747 in 1989 which flew through a thick cloud of volcanic ash."
"Both planes narrowly escaped disaster."
"Human life is priceless."
"I welcome the decision to close the airspace during this crisis and therefore to ensure that pilots do not have to take responsibility for the passengers entrusted to their care."
"Test and measurement flights have taken place, but only up to a certain height and under visual flight rules."
"These flights were not able to carry out any real analyses or produce any significant results."
"One other comment I have on flights under visual flight rules is that in the case of the KLM plane, the ash cloud was not visible."
"Nature teaches us respect and, at the same time, makes clear to us the limits of globalisation."
"We are all highly aware of the serious financial consequences."
"However, a human life is worth much more than goods."
"Therefore, taking into account the cases I have mentioned, I would like to call for the greatest possible responsibility and caution, including with regard to the division of the airspace into three zones."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Mr Kallas, this flight ban brings us back to the wide-ranging debate on safety which has often taken place in Parliament and in which we have said that we, by which I mean Parliament, and also, I believe, the Commission, could and should introduce regulations in this area on a European level, if the Member States wanted this to happen."
"We have often had this debate not only in relation to air transport but also in the context of the railways and other areas."
"Therefore, we should today be asking this question of those bodies that are able to answer it: firstly, the aviation authorities in the relevant countries and, of course, the organisation responsible for coordination at a European level."
"This coordination has worked exceptionally well."
"In my opinion, the top priority is the safety of passengers."
"The financial aspect is less important, although we must not lose sight of it."
"The individual countries made the right decision."
"I hope that in future, Eurocontrol and the national aviation safety authorities will make the decision and not the individual airlines, because we are once again faced with experts who have differing opinions."
"For this reason, we must be extremely cautious."
"From an economic perspective, it is, of course, a disaster for an industry which is now suffering its third crisis, following 11 September and the economic crisis."
"Therefore, we should take measures at a European and not a national level and provide aid packages which are compatible throughout Europe and do not distort the market, as has happened frequently in the past."
"Aid is needed, but not only at a national level."
"The passengers are now in a situation in which the law as it stands does not provide them with all the help that they might expect."
"Justifiably, we have discussed this subject often in Parliament."
"However, I assume that the airlines and the other companies affected will make it possible for the passengers to insist on the rights that still remain to them."
"For me, the future lies in the single European sky."
"I would like to point out that we will be discussing this subject frequently in the European Parliament over the next two years."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think there are three important elements to this debate."
"First of all, the support provided to and the repatriation of stranded passengers; that has to be the absolutely top priority for all authorities at all levels."
"In that connection, we can agree that the European Regulation on Passenger Rights has secured for a great many of them at least a minimum of comfort and support."
"However, in practice - as you are well aware - we have, of course, experienced quite a few problems: chaos in the airports, a lack of information, etc."
"I therefore advocate that we set up an enquiry at a European level, in cooperation with the airlines and all the other parties involved, so that we can look into how we can help in these kinds of situations."
"Moreover, I would also call on you to establish a kind of task force at Commission and Member State level to organise repatriation as effectively as possible."
"I know that this is a job for the airlines, but there are certainly people stranded out there in distant locations who will have to wait quite some time for repatriation, even if airspace is reopened."
"We need to give our attention to that."
"A second important element, a second chapter, if you like, is the procedure for instituting flight bans."
"What has happened is that we have again heard pleas for more cooperation and more European-level coordination and the single European sky - something to which references have already been made - will prove helpful in the future."
"It is true that the European Union currently has no decision-making powers either over the airspace of the Member States or over Eurocontrol, which makes it very difficult to take effective and coordinated decisions."
"However, it is also true that, until yesterday evening, we were actually using a rather conservative mathematical model at a European level."
"Basically, this model is based on the worst-case scenario, which means that a little bit of volcanic dust has been flagged up as a massive cloud requiring a flight ban, as it were."
"You will be aware that the US is using another model, one which applies a flight ban only to the area directly above the volcano itself and which leaves the operating risks in the hands of the airlines."
"That is another model."
"The model in between these two extremes that has already been agreed on - the one with the three zones - now, that is a good model."
"Let us see how we can really integrate safety and efficiency with that."
"My third and last point is about how we are coping with the economic impact."
"It is a good idea to list the various possibilities, but we need a European approach."
"Finally, let me just add that we should not delude people into thinking that we will be able to compensate everyone for the inconvenience they have suffered."
"That is simply not possible."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say something to the minister, that is, to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Not to you personally, but to everyone who has ever held your office, and possibly also to some of those who will hold it in the future."
"How have you been able to get away with obstructing a European approach of this kind for so many years now?"
"Time and again, the Commission and Parliament have had to push the Council into reaching an agreement and, even then, it always ends up being a weak compromise."
"Why is it that the Council always thinks in intergovernmental and national terms and not in European terms?"
"That is one of the lessons which we are going to have to take away from this situation."
"My fellow member, El Khadraoui, has already said that there is scope for better cooperation, but not just in terms of airspace management."
"Coordination between the national authorities could also be improved, but you have made the point yourself, President-in-Office, that Europe does not currently have the powers to make those improvements."
"Well, give Europe those powers, at long last!"
"That would make things a lot simpler."
"My second point concerns scientific information."
"We have a single centre in London which specialises in certain areas only and which has, in conjunction with Eurocontrol, decided that safety must come first."
"That was, indeed, the right decision to make, but does that go far enough?"
"Should we not strengthen the European model by bringing a few different specialisms together and creating a real European centre for aviation safety?"
"This volcano has not finished erupting yet."
"When it last erupted 200 years ago, it remained active for ten years."
"So, we need to make preparations for the years to come."
"I think we need to strengthen the European model and - and this is an important point for this House - we must also ensure that passenger rights remain intact and that State aid be awarded to everyone on the same footing."
"(FR) Mr President, even though thousands of people find themselves in great difficulties today, I believe that this volcanic eruption sounds like a real call to order: a call to order that urges us to review our relationship with the weather in the transport sector and, above all, our excessive dependence on air transport, which has gradually and, at times, without our knowledge, taken the place of all other means of transport."
"That is even more essential given that, today, no one can say, of course, whether this volcanic eruption will stop or how this cloud is going to move in the weeks and months to come."
"This means that we must primarily - and I support both the Commission and the Council on this - continue to abide by the precautionary principle and the principle of safety."
"I am, moreover, astonished to see that, at one point, in the pharmaceutical sector, the precautionary principle was used to put pressure on the Member States and on Europe to incur expenditure which, in my view, was somewhat ill-considered."
"Today, another sector seemingly also wants to question or criticise the precaution being taken by the Member States and the European Council."
"I find that extraordinary."
"There is no pocket-book precaution."
"Safety and the common good are the priority."
"As for the rest, I believe that we must, of course, develop rail transport."
"That is the main priority and, as my colleague said, it is clear that here, we have a vision of what our transport system should be; in other words, rail must recapture the market for small and medium distances."
"I also believe that diversity of transport and modes of transport is important."
"This, incidentally, is the subject of the White Paper on which we will have to work in committee."
"In the short term, I consider that the priority is surely to bring people back home, to compensate passengers and, perhaps, to see what needs to be done for the airlines, but in a very targeted way."
"I also believe that, structurally speaking, we must provide far greater support for videoconferencing."
"Videoconferencing as a medium remains extremely incidental and of little relevance to anyone; this applies not only in the case of Parliament, of course, but also more generally."
"I believe that support for such practices would help us to reduce our dependence on air travel."
"Finally, I believe, because the President asked us, that the European Parliament could, perhaps, for its part, review its way of working, by considering, for example, working five days a week for two weeks, rather than three days or three-and-a-half days per week."
"This would also be a way of setting an example, in the way that we organise our work, of how to be less dependent on air transport, which is, clearly, extremely fragile and subject, as nature is showing us today, to unknowns over which we have no control."
"It is truly a question of reviewing the system as a whole, and there will be an opportunity, within the framework of the White Paper, but also within the European Parliament, to review our own method of supporting other means of transport, including in terms of the way we work."
"(PL) Mr President, I greatly regret the fact that it seems many fellow Members, before making their speeches, did not seek the advice of professionals - people who have spent several thousand hours at the controls of an aircraft."
"I have the impression that this is an extremely political discussion, and that charges are being made against the Council, whereas the Council, for the life of me, is not responsible for volcanoes."
"It can be said with hand on heart that Eurocontrol's decision was too hasty, and I say this most emphatically, because everything was lumped together."
"The diversification of the situation which arose was not taken into account at all."
"We are responsible for the system of permanent air traffic management, and I think there is a lesson here which we can learn from these events."
"However, I am absolutely certain that the decisions which have already been made were made for too long a period of time, and it is my conviction that they could definitely have been different."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at moments like these, we must have words of comfort and sympathy for all those who have been, or still are, victims, in one way or another, of disruption to traffic, just as we must have words of sympathy for airline employees who, with the limited resources at their disposal, have tried to respond to passengers' needs."
"We do not wish to add our voice to those who criticise a great deal but offer few suggestions and still claim to be in possession of the truth once the storm has passed."
"We should like to say here that the principle of passenger safety must be reaffirmed as the priority principle."
"It is better to have a dissatisfied passenger who is alive than a passenger who, unfortunately, dies on board."
"I should like, at the same time, to say that Europe suffers from too little credibility."
"Better cooperation and unity would probably have meant better communication, a better explanation to us, and a better attempt at satisfying those who simply wanted information."
"In our opinion, it is important to strengthen the powers of the European Safety Agency and to allow it to rely, at all times, on scientific advice, on the basis of which it could justify its decisions in all circumstances."
"For the future - and this has already been said, but I believe that it should be re-emphasised - we shall have to do even more work to ensure that the means of transport crossing the territory of Europe complement one another by trying, here too, to ensure greater consistency between them."
"Finally, Mr President, if you will allow me, in order to dispel any suspicion that may exist, I should like to propose that a European Parliament committee of inquiry be set up on this matter."
"(DA) Mr President, I have two important points to make."
"Firstly, it is unfortunate that Europe is at a standstill and thus unable to compete globally, but that also applies to American and Asian airlines, which are unable to land in the EU."
"Secondly, I would like to thank all the parties involved for their efforts."
"It remains to be decided whether or not airlines will be financially compensated."
"The outcome will be decided by the debates in the days ahead."
"It is good to hear that there is now a three-step plan."
"I am pleased about that."
"The Financial Times criticises the politicians for having 'simply' shut everything down on safety grounds and suggests that Europe introduce the US strategy of allowing individual airlines to decide themselves whether or not to fly."
"I hope that we here in Parliament will immediately reject that model."
"It would be disastrous for passengers if an airline threatened with bankruptcy decided to fly simply for the sake of profit."
"What we need is a forward-looking strategy: better measuring instruments in the airspace to predict atmospheric changes and the development of aircraft engines that use fuel more efficiently and are less sensitive."
"However, aircraft are vulnerable not only to terrorist attacks, but also to extreme weather conditions."
"Aircraft are highly energy-intensive and polluting."
"It will not be possible to develop solar-powered or electric versions of cargo or passenger aircraft, but what we can do is finally get started on high-speed trains and on establishing direct high-speed rail links between all the major cities of Europe."
"Trains can be made much greener than aircraft and are genuinely capable of competing with aircraft for internal European destinations."
"Mr President, today we know better than we did a week ago that jet-free skies cost a lot."
"The cost to airlines goes beyond their lost revenues. Other industries are affected, though there are also industries benefiting from the situation."
"What matters is also the fact that this new disaster has hit the already very fragile European economy facing the need for fiscal consolidation."
"I would like to raise two issues."
"The first is related to State aid."
"Offering airlines State aid in compensation for the losses has a precedent in the bail out offered to American Airlines after 9/11."
"The European Commission also offers fast-track procedures to State aid, which is appreciated."
"But my question to the Commission is whether we know the expected size of this new burden for national budgets suffering from huge deficits and debts and facing the challenge of fiscal consolidation."
"Is State aid through national budgets the best solution?"
"Are any other options being considered by the European Commission?"
"The second issue is related to the European Union's capacity to manage crises."
"We hear that during the first few days, there was no consultation or coordination amongst relevant national authorities in a situation covering 80% of European air space."
"I can assure you, Commissioner, that you can be totally independent and still coordinate."
"We might also hear soon that coordination would have allowed us to design and implement a better solution, so in my view, this is the time to move forward on EU crisis management."
"We clearly see that disasters that affect our citizens can also occur outside the EU territory in the European Economic Area, or even outside the EEA."
"My question to the Commission is: how will it use this disaster to enhance the European Union crisis management capacity?"
"I can assure you that we in the European Parliament will support all your efforts to make us more effective and more efficient in crisis management."
"(DE) Mr President, in the last few days, I have seen and experienced the alternatives to air travel in Europe, on the one hand, during a car journey from Belgrade to Vienna and then on a train journey from Vienna to Strasbourg."
"Although there are problems on the roads, the road infrastructure is relatively well developed, even in Europe's neighbouring regions."
"However, the situation on the railways remains appalling."
"This is not acceptable."
"Where would we be today if we had implemented the provisions of the so-called Delors Plan?"
"We would already have the trans-European networks and we would have more high-speed rail lines and high-speed trains."
"After only a few hours, the toilets on the train were unusable, although it was a modern carriage, because a lot of people had to stand or sit on the floor for several hours and therefore the trains were overcrowded and the facilities overstretched."
"Therefore, I would like to call on Mr Kallas to give a new impetus to the modernisation of the railways in the form of more high-speed trains and the provision of capacity reserves."
"We need a certain amount of reserves."
"Not only during the disastrous volcanic explosion, but also in winter, we have discovered that we have too few reserves and that focusing on profitability alone is not enough."
"We must also put more emphasis on accommodation."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Mr Kallas, thank you very much for your explanations and for the work that you have done."
"I agree with you that the priority is safety, and that the crisis that has affected us is a complicated one, but we took too long to communicate, because we did so five days after the first attempt."
"However, in order to measure up to what people, the European public, expect from us now, the conclusions of this debate need to be clear, simple and, moreover, practical."
"They also need to have immediate effects that everyone can see."
"Therefore, the taxpayers, who will also have to pay for this crisis, definitely have the right to be guaranteed at least three things: firstly, greater transparency regarding the decisions to close airports and how the situation is developing."
"They were informed late when the crisis first began, which I believe helped to increase the problems in many airports, and also made it more difficult for many users to make alternative travel arrangements."
"We therefore also need greater transparency now that the three zones have been defined."
"We want to know what they are and what they are going to mean."
"Secondly, they have the right to be guaranteed total respect for passengers' rights."
"We need clarity, we need to define who is responsible for passengers' rights, what the scope of those rights is going to be and the deadlines for exercising them."
"I agree with Commissioner Kallas that there also needs to be monitoring of the processes that the airlines are going to use in order to allow for these claims."
"The final thing that they have a right to be guaranteed is State aid for the airlines."
"I ask you to clearly define what this State aid is going to be and what the criteria are going to be for granting it, and that we monitor and control the consequences that this crisis could have for airline workers."
"We also need to maximise the control measures in order to prevent airlines from using circumstances like these to make gratuitous or excessive adjustments to their workforce."
"What this current crisis has very clearly shown is the need to develop European coordination and interoperability further."
"Mr President, as has already been said, no one could have predicted the recent events in Iceland."
"The airline industry is having to cope with very unpredictable circumstances, both in terms of the volcanic eruption and, of course, the general economic background."
"With this in mind, we should base such an extreme measure of shutting all European airspace on proper scientific evidence and, with the current technology available, make sure that disruption is minimal and information is communicated efficiently."
"In this respect, Eurocontrol and national authorities have added to the frustration with their poor management of this crisis."
"Continually pushing back the closure of Europe's airspace every six to eight hours has meant that passengers could not plan journeys by other means and airlines themselves have been kept waiting for progress."
"Computer modelling and satellite technology are available to aid these situations but, even with all of this technology, we still seem to have been in a position of almost licking our finger and sticking it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing."
"At least, that is the way the public perceives it."
"This has been a disaster for all concerned."
"Long-term prognosis, not decisions by knee-jerk bulletin, is what is required."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like first of all to emphasise that the application of the precautionary principle by the majority of the European governments when they closed their airspace in a targeted and temporary manner was a wise and prudent decision."
"The safety of our fellow citizens must surpass every other consideration and, in these circumstances, the attitude of certain airlines in demanding the complete and immediate opening of the airspace on the strength of one or two test flights seems obscene, to say the least."
"I believe that it was Mr HÃ©nin who spoke just now about the complementarity of transport, particularly as regards the railways, and I should like to take this opportunity to say how sorry I am that paralysis in the air has been made worse by the disruption in rail transport caused by strikes that are both irresponsible and incomprehensible in these circumstances."
"To return to our subject, I should like to commend the Commission's decision to authorise the release of public funds to airlines affected by the current disruption."
"It is a common sense decision in a context already marked by crisis; this assistance must, however, be considered as exceptional."
"In this connection, I would like the criteria for granting these funds to include the exemplary behaviour that the airlines must demonstrate in compensating their customers who have fallen victim to flight cancellations."
"Indeed, it is unacceptable that certain airlines should be abusing the force majeure clause to avoid their obligation under Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 to compensate passengers."
"Travellers are victims of the current situation and, where no alternative solution is offered to them, they should not have to bear the financial cost as well."
"Moreover, travel agencies are exempt from the obligation to compensate travellers for unused flights."
"That is not right, either."
"Airlines, like travel agencies, have insurance that covers them in exceptional cases, such as the one that we have been experiencing these last few days, and we must therefore ensure that travellers are properly compensated for flights that have been cancelled."
"(RO) Approximately 2 million passengers in the EU-27 use air transport every year, with 22% travelling domestically, 44% inside the EU and 34% outside the EU."
"The eruption of the volcano in Iceland has highlighted to us the weakness of the European transport system."
"During the last six days, more than 17 000 flights have been cancelled and millions of passengers have remained stuck in various locations, both inside and outside the EU."
"In these circumstances, the rapid provision of accurate information to passengers was an absolute must."
"Passenger safety must be our overriding concern."
"This is why, particularly within the European Union, there should be an efficient system for redirecting passengers to other forms of transport: rail, waterways or roads."
"If such a system had been in operation, 66% of passengers who were grounded during this period and those travelling within a Member State or the EU itself would have reached their destination using other means of transport."
"It is becoming absolutely vital to allocate the necessary funds for a trans-European transport network to be developed so that high-speed railway lines can serve not only all the Member States' capitals but other large European cities as well."
"Another increasingly paramount aspect is the development of transport along inland waterways and of the European maritime corridors."
"Let us demonstrate political will and stick to our slogan: 'Keep Europe moving!'."
"(GA) Mr President, I would like to welcome the efforts Commissioner Kallas and the transport ministers have made to resolve this problem."
"Despite the age of technology in which we live today, I think it is a reminder to us that we are in the hands of Mother Nature like never before."
"I come from a country - Ireland - where we are two sea crossings from mainland Europe."
"I do know that we, and the people that I represent, have felt the effects of this possibly more than any other citizens in other Member States."
"After the announcements last night, there was real hope that the situation would ease."
"However, overnight it has changed again, and the restrictions in our airspace have been extended until 13.00 today."
"Many passengers are stranded in various parts - not just of Europe, but many parts of the world - and our priority must be to try and help those people, to help the many people who have deaths in their families and who cannot get home."
"Those people should be given priority by the airlines and not ignored by them and treated the same as any other passenger."
"The economic impact is immense and I am pleased that the Commissioner will be heading up a group to establish the economic consequences of this."
"Of course, it is essential - and I think this is the real point - that the role of Eurocontrol is strengthened as a result of the crisis, because volcanoes do not respect economic, geographic or political boundaries."
"We must deal with this from the centre."
"I agree that dealing with it from 27 perspectives, or countries, is not successful."
"One of the biggest problems facing the passengers today is the confusion ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, the ash cloud has caused stress and trauma for many thousands of travellers and financial loss to many businesses."
"Indeed, many of our own colleagues from far-flung corners of Europe have been left stranded this week."
"The Presidency should be thanked for agreeing that it would be undemocratic to vote without them - all too often, those of us from further away feel that we are being brushed aside in the interests of central European alliances."
"The volcano has also reminded us that we are not masters of this planet and do not have the answers to all the questions."
"It is clear that we need a much better understanding both of volcanic ash and of volcanic gases, and research in this area should be encouraged."
"It has also reminded us of how addicted we have become to air transportation."
"We know we must reduce that dependency in the years to come."
"We should welcome investments in advanced communications systems for virtual meetings, as well as investment in high-speed railways."
"Finally, plans to reduce unnecessary travel should be welcomed."
"That is clearly one area where Parliament could lead by example."
"(RO) Exceptional natural phenomena, such as the eruption in Iceland, cannot yet, unfortunately, be predicted."
"An inadequate response may be justified in such cases, but only once."
"We must closely analyse what happened and prepare an effective response in the event of such a phenomenon recurring."
"The information about the eruption's consequences was inadequate."
"Today, almost a week since the chaos broke out, we still do not know how much longer it is going to last and what the actual risks are."
"A centre needs to be set up to carry out suitable monitoring, regardless of the cost, in order to give those involved, companies and passengers the opportunity to take the necessary measures."
"The companies' response was late and disjointed, which created major problems for passengers."
"Companies made no attempt to cooperate in order to coordinate the management of the flow of passengers and the maximum possible use of the routes still available."
"The only logical response to this shortcoming is to create the single European sky and establish a centralised traffic control system under the responsibility of a single body."
"President-in-Office of the Council, last year, I was rapporteur for the single European sky initiative and I found it extremely difficult to reach the current format of the initiative, having conducted extremely tough negotiations with the Council."
"This year, the exact same thing is happening with the European freight corridors."
"I believe that Member States should understand something about what has happened now."
"Member States' response was inadequate and it failed to provide transport via other means."
"Currently in Europe, it is not possible to buy a train ticket in a civilised manner."
"The creation of a European centre responsible for intervention and coordination in the event of exceptional natural disasters is an absolute must."
"The modernisation of rail transport is also a priority about which a huge amount is said, but too little done."
"I hope that Member States have understood one extremely important message: it is not enough to be prepared in your own backyard; the same conditions must be in place across the whole European Union."
"What is needed is coordination, responsibility and a decision-making facility, all at European Union level."
"(EL) Mr President, the skill of the captain shows in the storm."
"In the volcanic storm which hit Europe, the Union was slow to foresee, slow to react to and slow to prevent the spread of the problems for European citizens."
"Just as we were slow to react to the economic storm, but that is another story."
"There are two aspects to today's debate:"
"Firstly, as regards the ban on flights and coordination."
"Obviously, it cannot be the companies that weigh the risk of life against the cost to them and decide when and where they fly."
"That is a matter for the competent national authorities."
"The only absolutely positive achievement over the past few days is that there were no victims to mourn; we did not risk it."
"However, in a situation which went beyond the borders of Europe, it should have been the national authorities, from the very first instant, that coordinated with Eurocontrol and with the meteorologists, to see if they could open the corridors, which today we are now saying that we are opening - to my mind unfortunately - following financial pressure from the companies."
"That terrifies me."
"Secondly, in such a chaotic situation, it is unacceptable that the application of the European Regulation on passenger compensation was contested, a regulation which - in such circumstances - should be activated automatically."
"Do you know that few trapped passengers have been assured by their companies that they will be paid for overnight accommodation and that, of them, most obtained payment because they drove a hard bargain with the companies, while the majority received nothing?"
"I believe that the European Parliament should investigate how the companies reacted, compared with the regulation, and if passengers' rights were respected."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, good morning."
"We are dealing with exceptional circumstances here, of course."
"The current disruption to air traffic is more severe than that around the time of 9/11, but it is clear that we were not as well-prepared as we could have been for such an emergency situation."
"Despite all the efforts made by the tour operators and airline staff, many passengers have simply been abandoned to their fate and have had to cobble together a solution on their own."
"We clearly have to learn from this situation and take appropriate measures."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, we have no choice but to adopt an emergency plan, a European-coordinated plan."
"What is key here is that the plan must provide stranded passengers with not just safety, of course, but information and help, as well, so that those who are affected, at the very least, have someone they can turn to and are guaranteed shelter."
"We have to seize on these events in order to substantially improve the fate of any passengers affected in the future."
"In the past few days, another thing that has become clear is that we in Europe are going to have to invest an awful lot more in creating a cross-border high-speed rail network, which would provide an environmentally friendly alternative to what is clearly a vulnerable air transport network."
"Let us make real efforts, within the framework of EU 2020, to bring about a compelling investment rail project which will be good for the individual citizen, good for the environment and good for employment."
"(DE) Mr President, as if we had been able to predict what was going to happen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which is also responsible for civil protection, has an own-initiative report on the community approach to the prevention of natural disasters in the pipeline."
"The rapporteur is Mr Ferreira."
"We will be voting on this report in the next session and we will discuss our experience of the volcanic ash cloud then."
"Plenary will very soon be able to formulate Parliament's position on these subjects."
"I agree with the Members who have said that we are poorly prepared for natural disasters."
"Fortunately, Europe has few natural disasters."
"However, we also have little experience in this area and it is clear that our crisis management is poor."
"In my opinion, it all took too long."
"Five days before a test flight took place and real data was collected is simply too long."
"We must learn from this."
"I do not want to make any accusations, but experience shows that we must do things better the next time around."
"If this volcanic ash has made one thing clear, it is the need for more Europe."
"Mr Kallas, you have said that the national authorities have responsibilities."
"However, this does not help the people who have suffered as a result."
"We need more Europe in civil protection and in a common transport policy."
"The Treaty of Lisbon opens up more opportunities for us."
"In the same way as Mrs HÃ¼bner, I would like to ask you how you will make use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon in crisis management and civil protection."
"This situation must improve."
"(FR) Mr President, 'shambles', 'chaos', 'paralysis', 'cacophony', 'catastrophe', 'disaster': the press is not lacking for words to describe the closure of European airspace and its consequences."
"I shall not dwell on what has already been said, notably as regards the extent of the huge - unfathomable, one might say - financial impact of this crisis in direct or indirect terms."
"While I welcome the possibility of exceptional public aid being granted to the airline sector, which has already suffered a great deal since 11 September 2001, I am still perplexed about Europe's management of these events."
"Firstly, knowing that 750 000 European passengers have been affected, a good number of whom are still stuck in the four corners of the world, knowing that the economic losses are growing exponentially over time, how can we explain that it has taken not one, not two, three or four, but five days for the European transport ministers to hold a meeting, by teleconferencing, to coordinate their actions and to decide to create traffic-differentiated zones?"
"Secondly, no one contests the need, as an absolute priority - and I stress the word 'priority' - to apply the precautionary principle."
"However, today, when traffic is gradually being permitted once again in secure zones, in unchanged weather conditions, and when the volcano is still active, one is entitled to wonder what additional safety guarantees for passengers we could not have provided earlier, sooner."
"Thirdly, a model of evolving action has been developed - according to the weather forecast, the evolution and activity of the volcano can change from hour to hour - but who is going to continue to carry out an up-to-date assessment of the safety of air corridors?"
"Must these test flights be carried out by civil aviation and the airlines?"
"Finally, if this lasts, gets worse or happens again - which is likely - the management method put in place must provide for greater coordination among Member States and special operational procedures based on real data and better coordination of other means of transport in exceptional circumstances."
"It must also take account, however, of the need to coordinate assistance so that we can get the tens of thousands of stranded passengers home; they too are entitled to information and assistance."
"So far, however, only isolated and national initiatives have been taken."
"(ES) Mr President, I welcome the opportunity that this debate gives us to face up to our responsibilities."
"In response to today's crises, the national dimension and intergovernmental decisions are not sufficient, nor are simple solutions, even if they are based on statistical models."
"It is right to recognise the diligence with which, on the day after airspace was closed, the Spanish Presidency of the Council saw the opportunity for a European approach in order to find a solution to the chaos that was already spreading beyond the national governments and, more importantly, was plunging thousands of travellers within and outside our borders into a desperate situation."
"Repatriating them must be our priority."
"While the initial measures were adequate, according to the principle of precaution and guaranteeing safety for all citizens - those flying and those under the flight path - the lack of clarity about the future and a growing feeling of unease, as a result of the complexity of the intergovernmental decisions, raised the big question that is always raised: what is Europe doing?"
"We have to acknowledge that the joint work by Commissioner Kallas and the Spanish Presidency succeeded in record time - which is never quick enough, but to be honest, given the difficulties, they did it in record time - in changing the approach."
"Although this approach is precautionary, as it has to be, it raises important questions."
"The conclusions of this choice are: the application of passengers' rights does not stand up in an exceptional situation."
"The work done at European and national level was not sufficient."
"In the short term, we need to repatriate and provide urgent solutions, but in the medium term, we need to improve."
"The External Action Service should also be able to respond to these emergencies; in some cases, it cannot close at the weekend."
"The air traffic sector, travel agents, the tourism industry, logistics, etc., which were only just glimpsing an end to the crisis, have taken a real battering, and I welcome the presence of Commissioner Almunia, who will be responsible for managing the solution required for the sector."
"Ending the uncertainty as soon as possible will also help us to get out of this crisis."
"Finally, we clearly need a replacement system for air travel, even once there is a single European sky."
"The railways, the roads and the maritime sector put together have not managed to replace it."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Kallas, we are certainly dealing with a crisis situation."
"In Europe, air traffic has been reduced by 70%, and 80% of airports have been closed."
"I do hope, however, that we are able to draw several constructive conclusions."
"Firstly, the Commission should do everything to ensure that the eruption of the volcano does not lead to the bankruptcy of European air carriers, which are in a catastrophic financial situation as it is."
"I say this in the context of yesterday's debate on financing the security of air travel and the Council's resistance to financing stricter measures related to security."
"Secondly, experiments with new, unproven technologies such as body and liquid scanners will certainly not improve security, but they undoubtedly will have an effect on the financial condition of European air carriers."
"Thirdly, the question of passengers."
"I think the decision to halt flights out of concern for passenger safety was a wise one."
"However, that concern should not stop there, but should also include help for those who, through no fault of their own, have been stranded at airports."
"These matters have already been discussed more than once at sittings of the European Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Paradoxically, however, only the eruption of the volcano in Iceland has made us all aware how essential the aviation industry is to the proper functioning of the European Union economy, and this is true in particular of those representatives of the EU institutions who, for this reason, were not able to attend the funeral in Krakow on Sunday."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the response of the European Union and the Member States to this crisis has been entirely satisfactory and that everything possible has been done."
"They have acted according to the principle that safety is paramount."
"We can discuss whether the ash cloud should have been investigated more quickly."
"I believe that this would have been possible, but in principle, what was done was acceptable."
"We now need to discuss and think carefully about what should be done for the people, the European citizens, who are stranded."
"I was called yesterday by three people who are in this situation."
"One case concerns members of a family who are waiting in an airport in Thailand and have been told that they will probably be able to fly out on 29 April."
"They have already spent a whole week at the airport."
"The second case involves young people in New York who have been told not to leave their hotel for at least a week, because they could be picked up at any moment."
"The third case is a family of pensioners on an island in the Norwegian Sea, who can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation, but are unable to leave."
"These are issues which we in the European Parliament need to think about and discuss."
"We must offer these people solutions, give them support and make useful proposals."
"We cannot abandon the European citizens who are in this situation; we must help them."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"We are now in an extreme situation, because the subject that we are debating is so urgent and so distressing for many people, and in particular for the public, that we have more 'catch-the-eye' requests than ever."
"This is a record, as I think we have 13 or 15 requests, and even though Members are still asking to be included, we obviously cannot have 20 people speaking."
"We are nevertheless going to try to enable everyone to speak, among other things, until the President arrives, as he has stepped out for a moment and I am replacing him on an impromptu basis."
"As I do not wish to begin the next debate, we are going to be conducting the catch-the-eye procedure until the President's eye drops out or everyone on the list has spoken."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the Minister of the Spanish Presidency for their speeches and for the work they have done."
"I do not think there is any question that the priority in this emergency is to guarantee safety, and safety has been guaranteed, because the outcome of this disaster, of this unexpected, natural event, is that no aircraft have been involved in an accident caused by the cloud."
"The safety objective has therefore been achieved, and we can only be pleased about that."
"There are still two problems today: the first is that of the timescale."
"Could action have been taken sooner?"
"Could it have been taken earlier?"
"Could steps have been taken to intervene sooner and to reopen the area that was safest for air traffic sooner, given the huge economic effect, the economic impact that this disaster is having on air traffic and on the airlines?"
"Could action not have been taken earlier?"
"This requires answers."
"The second issue: thousands of passengers are still grounded and are having to stay in hotels, to change ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, this debate has given rise to many speeches by transport specialists."
"It is true that we have focused strongly on the economic problems that this exceptional and unforeseeable situation has caused."
"There are also human aspects, as has been said, and I am looking at the situation more from the point of view of a defender of citizens as consumers, many hundreds of thousands of whom are currently stranded somewhere in the world, unable to return home."
"I am thinking more of them, and especially of those who can no longer afford to stay where they are, who are stranded and have no other solution."
"As regards these empty skies and these airports full of people in distress, thought may have to be given to recasting the directives on transport, especially air transport."
"The directive on package travel will probably be reviewed."
"Could we not - and this has not been spoken of so far - think about compulsory insurance to provide cover, in the event of force majeure, for such people, especially so as not to leave them in distress?"
"(PL) Mr President, the current situation makes us realise and testifies to our impotence before the forces of nature."
"However, as a serious organisation, the European Union should be better prepared for such situations, and should, in particular, be ready to react efficiently in urgent cases."
"It is difficult, of course, to prepare for something which may or may not happen once every 150 years, but we can see at the moment that the European railway infrastructure and network of connections is completely insufficient."
"We have to answer the question, here, as to how this should be improved."
"Other questions which we ought to discuss are, firstly, what kind of public assistance will be made available to businesses which are under threat?"
"We know that huge amounts of money will be needed to repair the financial situation of these businesses."
"Another question is how we should develop a strategy which will prepare us in the long term to react and make better improvements ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, the Commissioner talked about the procedures being absurd and obsolete."
"Let us therefore be consistent."
"We have wasted too many opportunities, too many treaties, when we could have introduced Community powers over European airspace."
"Nevertheless, while we were not able to act as we should have done in the air, we can do so on the ground."
"For example, we can monitor passengers' rights and also mediate or ask for a truce in the various land transport industrial disputes."
"There should be no minimum services; there should be maximum services for all."
"(PL) Mr President, I hope the current difficult situation in European transport will not last for too long and will not turn into a real transport crisis."
"The experience we are gaining is too expensive, but is very instructive."
"We should draw the right conclusions, and here are some which suggest themselves immediately."
"Firstly, transport security, both in the area of quality and in the ability of citizens to travel, is a priority obligation which we have in common."
"Secondly, there is a need for balanced development of all forms of transport, but in particular, we must not neglect rail transport."
"Thirdly, efficient transport is the lifeblood of the economy."
"The transportation of goods and the mobility of the workforce are decisive for development, and we should remember this particularly during the economic crisis."
"Finally, there is a need for suitable procedures, coordination, separate support for airlines, mutual help and European solidarity for the good of our citizens."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Kallas, the catastrophe has shown us that we do not have procedures in the European Union for dealing with catastrophes like the one which has arisen as a result of the volcanic eruption."
"Firstly, the European Union should coordinate matters relating to safety and decide whether or not aeroplanes can fly."
"This must not be exclusively for Member States to decide."
"Secondly, we need to think about the question of economic responsibility."
"I think a European system of insurance against this type of situation, or perhaps national insurance schemes, should be the solution."
"Thirdly, on the matter of the logistics of passengers who were stuck in transit between particular countries, there was a lack of real mobility in the transport and TNT networks and of fast trains."
"Finally, I think that in the case of passengers who have been left stranded outside the European Union, the European External Action Service should be ready with definite procedures for helping them."
"I hope those rapid procedures will be introduced."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past few days, we have experienced an unprecedented upheaval in our lives."
"Aeroplanes, which we depend on to travel to and from our regions to Brussels and Strasbourg, are no longer available."
"The upheaval has been massive; we have had to take trains, ships and buses, it has all taken much longer and numerous members were barely able to get here."
"However, what we have seen over the past few days is that we are absolutely dependent upon aeroplanes; we have seen that there are alternative means, but that the present rail infrastructure in Europe is inadequate; it is not state of the art."
"Can we perhaps imagine a European Union with a full network of high-speed trains, a Europe in which all journeys less than 1 000 kilometres long are made by train and in which we only use aeroplanes for longer journeys?"
"The impact of air travel on the climate in the European Union is huge."
"It is greater than that of refineries and steel works ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I believe that the responses that can be given now can only alleviate the current situation, but cannot prevent it from happening again."
"In transport, there are no short cuts, there are no short-term solutions, and this should be an opportunity - even more so now that the White Paper is being drawn up - to include, introduce and establish the necessary measures to reduce our excessive dependence on our air transport connections."
"We need to balance these connections by facilitating and strengthening the alternatives that are currently severely lacking in comparison, such as railways and sea transport."
"I therefore think that both Mr Kallas and Mr Grosch, who is the rapporteur for the report, will have taken note of the requests made by all the Members regarding the need to strengthen the railways and the trans-European networks for this mode of transport."
"(DA) Mr President, a lot of sensible things have been said during the debate this morning, but I think we need to look a bit more to the future."
"What we have experienced is something we will experience again."
"The experts in Iceland say that it is not a matter of whether there will be further eruptions - the question is merely when they will occur."
"That is why we need to look slightly further ahead and work out how to handle such a situation when it occurs again in the future."
"As part of this, I believe that we need to start focusing on getting high-speed rail links between the European capitals and how we bring about the interoperability that is needed."
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, clear to us all that passenger safety must be our top priority and that we are having this discussion today primarily because nature has reminded us of this."
"Flights have been grounded across most of Europe, passengers are waiting indefinitely, airlines are sinking into the red, industry workers are afraid for their jobs, the economic damage is immense."
"Obviously, airlines are entitled to think that, if farmers can claim damages for natural disasters, they, too, are entitled to an indemnity."
"As for the environment, we have certainly done it a huge favour over the past couple of days."
"Interconnection - let that be the lesson that Europe needs better integration of air, rail and road traffic, that we need to provide finance for high-speed trains and that we need less pollution."
"We need to respond immediately and responsibly and, above all, with passenger safety in mind."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my sympathies to everyone who has been affected by this crisis."
"Now, 'crisis' is a word that we have been hearing far too often these days: economic crisis, financial crisis, transport crisis, every other kind of crisis under the sun."
"If one thing is clear, it is that our society is extremely vulnerable to crises of this kind."
"We need a safety net."
"We tend to talk a lot about the green society, but a green society also needs to include green transport and we have clearly not completed our work yet as far as that is concerned."
"Many members of my group and others, as well, have said it already: it is a matter of great urgency that we invest in green transport and in better and faster connections within the EU - and, of course, better and faster connections outside the EU, too, if we are able to have any say there - by rail and why not by boat, as well, if it comes to that?"
"That would be good for the economy, good for the climate and also good for the stability of this society, because that is what it desperately needs."
"(DE) Mr President, it has become clear that the focus of this whole issue is on the passengers."
"We want passengers from Europe to be transported safely."
"We want safety, but we also want transport options."
"I believe that we need all the means of transport currently available."
"We need aircraft, as we cannot replace flying with another solution."
"A lot has been said about high-speed trains."
"Of course, it would be good to have more of them, but what use is the best high-speed train if it has to stop at the border?"
"For this reason, I think we should take one step at a time."
"Firstly, we need continuity across the European rail systems, in just the same way that we need the single European sky."
"As all the parties have spoken out in favour of more coordination between the Member States, I would like to call on everyone once again to take action, because it is the parties in the Member States who are responsible for blocking progress in this area."
"Please make sure that the parties at home in the Member States are genuinely in favour of opening up transport in Europe."
"If we are all able to convince our parties, the situation will improve in future."
"(RO) There has been a huge amount of talk in recent days about the financial losses sustained by airlines, which are an actual fact."
"It is becoming clear that a mechanism for providing assistance to these companies needs to be adopted, all the more so as this crisis caused by the eruption of the volcano in Iceland may be protracted."
"However, I believe that passenger safety and consumer protection must come above everything else."
"There has been a huge level of discontent among passengers whose treatment varies from one country or company to another."
"It is obvious that practices in this area need to be standardised, which would mark a big step forward for passengers who are currently on the move from place to place, against a backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the reopening of the airspace."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this crisis that we have been experiencing for some days has also demonstrated - and this has not been said enough - the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which the European Union was able to put into action in the last decade."
"This failure, which stems from deregulation and fierce competition, shows today, with this crisis, that the European Union has been incapable of coordinating the necessary approach that would have made it possible not only to protect those who are trapped in these airports but also to plot the way forward by allowing airlines to make test flights, for example."
"I call on the European Union, therefore, to pull itself together."
"We are told that we need more Europe."
"Indeed, there must be a public service, supported by the European Union, in a sector as prominent as air transport."
"(PT) Mr President, this was, of course, an unforeseen crisis and the precautionary principle must naturally take priority."
"There are, however, lessons to be learnt, and the first is that no sufficiently strong and politically responsible European voice has been heard for five days."
"Such a voice has been lacking with regard to the protection of passengers' interests, the clarification of their rights, the search for alternative transport and the coordination of solutions."
"A second conclusion is that the way out of the crisis must not look to the ordinary citizen like a power struggle between those who want to avoid economic losses and those who want to uphold the precautionary principle."
"There must be clear transparency and clear objectivity as regards the conditions under which we get out of this situation, in which the whole of Europe's air space has been shut down."
"Therefore, improving scientific tests and also coordination at the level ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, the precautionary principle has become a principle of irresponsibility."
"In the face of the slightest risk, the precautionary principle has become an invitation to abandon all responsibility."
"No so-called 'responsible' parties dare shoulder their responsibilities any longer."
"A potential influenza epidemic?"
"Hey presto, thousands of people are invited to be vaccinated."
"An erupting volcano?"
"Hey presto, the entire European airspace is closed, even though experience has shown that volcanic ash is not really dangerous except for aeroplanes that have to cross a dense cloud."
"However, because of the precautionary principle, our companies are subject to the failure of the responsible parties to assume responsibility, to the weakness of experts and to the impotence of politics, which has taken to chattering about the need to reduce our excessive dependence on air transport and to invest more in rail networks, probably by extending them as far as Asia, the Americas, Africa, Oceania and every island in between."
"Mr President, I think there has clearly been agreement that first of all, we need to focus on nature."
"Mr Cramer said this quite clearly, and I agree with him, because this is an important message for all of us."
"We must also, of course, focus on the European Union, on European action, in response to a crisis that has European importance and which has had an extremely serious impact on millions of citizens of Europe and other countries outside the European Union, as well as on the economies of major European sectors."
"It was immediately apparent that the events overtook the action of the Member States, who have decision-making powers to open the airports, and therefore, there was immediate intervention from the European Union."
"I repeat, Mr Speroni, Mrs Ferreira, the action was immediate."
"On Friday, it became apparent that a serious situation was setting in."
"As soon as this became apparent, the European Commission, along with the Spanish Presidency of the Council and Eurocontrol, immediately set to work, and on Sunday - as Mr Kallas said earlier - there was a public appearance by the Commission and the Presidency - Mr Kallas and myself - explaining the situation and setting out what was going to be done."
"The action to be taken was yesterday's meeting of Eurocontrol and the decision of the extraordinary Council meeting, called by the Spanish Government and chaired by the Spanish Minister for Public Works, which took place yesterday."
"Therefore, action was taken."
"Action was taken in order for this to lead to a decision, to action, to an approach, a focus that was European in nature."
"Today, yesterday's decision by the extraordinary Council of Ministers is being implemented."
"This morning, at 08.00, Eurocontrol defined four zones with an extended safety perimeter in which there can be no flights, and other areas in which there can be flights, provided that there are agreements and coordination among the Member States."
"Airspace is therefore gradually being opened up, but this will naturally depend on the conditions and on nature."
"Naturally, it will depend on these things, but the decision taken yesterday is already in practice today, and this will, of course, always be done on the basis of the precautionary principle and the need to ensure safety."
"I believe that what was immediately seen is that in this case, the European approach meant that a much more balanced decision could be adopted."
"The European approach meant that various factors could be taken into account that should always be taken into account when something extraordinary happens such as what we are going through at the moment."
"Firstly, it means that the risk assessment model is much more precise, much more accurate."
"Mr Sterckx, in response to what you said about this, I want to say that Eurocontrol is taking into account the decisions made by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in London, but it is also going to take into account the test flights, the information from the national authorities, the information from the aeroplane manufacturers, and the information from the European Aviation Safety Agency in Cologne, which I agree needs to be strengthened."
"All of this will be taken into account in order to draw up a more accurate map, as is happening now, at this moment, through the technical proposal being produced by Eurocontrol, based on scientific data."
"The European approach means that safety, which is an essential, fundamental principle, above all other principles, can be taken into account at the same time, and I therefore agree with those who have said this."
"It means that the economic consequences can be taken into account, and the Commission has set up a working group - which has also been very well received by you - to present a report next week on aspects relating to the economy."
"It also means that citizens' rights and their mobility can be taken into consideration."
"That is why I am again calling on all the European Union governments to help get people home, to make use of every possible means of communication, and to make a special, extraordinary effort to do so, because that is the main right that citizens have: to go home, to go to wherever they want to go."
"We are therefore calling for their right to free movement to be respected."
"For the future, I believe that this situation opens up a panorama for us for a very thorough debate, and the European Parliament is the right place for that debate to take place."
"This debate must look at the problem of passengers' rights under these exceptional circumstances, and the need for an emergency plan, which also requires transparency - as Mrs Bilbao said - in the European Union's actions, so that there can be structural reforms, which means strengthening the trans-European rail networks in Europe."
"This is becoming an absolutely strategic objective, which, all things considered, is simply the structuring of Europe, because historically, the structuring of the modern state was done on the basis of developing communications, roads, railways, and also maritime connections."
"In the future, the structuring of Europe, the Europe of the 21st century, will not be completed if it is not done through the infrastructures of communication, in this case, essentially through the railways."
"The two things go hand in hand, and developing these transport infrastructures is a strongly political, symbolic and real issue, which is becoming a central objective for 21st century Europe."
"In this respect I believe that this was exactly the right place and time for Mr Swoboda, Mr Schulz and Mrs Ãlvarez and for other speakers to mention these reforms, because this is undoubtedly an element for the future that the European Union needs to aim towards."
"Mr President, could I respectfully ask that this debate be extended, because this exchange is far too polite."
"People are being treated like dirt in train stations, by airlines and by authorities in airports."
"We are being far too polite."
"We should be using the EU's power in the Council and in the Commission to force people to open information points."
"In Brussels Central Station, there are six information points; four of them are closed."
"This debate should be far longer, and more Members should be allowed to participate in it."
"I am not at all pleased with the action taken by the Council and the Commission to serve the interests of the travelling public, who are sleeping in train stations."
"That has been mentioned several times, today."
"Everyone from the European Parliament who spoke before you raised these matters."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for all their remarks."
"I have four additional ones to make."
"First of all, these events have given us much food for thought as regards our strategic plans."
"One of the most interesting and crucial issues is intermodality and flexibility between modes of transport, and the ability of railways to act as some kind of alternative."
"We will address this issue soon, with the discussions on the recasting of the first railway package and the White Paper on the future of transport."
"This is a very serious issue."
"Yesterday, we discussed it with the Council of Ministers as well."
"I can promise you that we are taking this issue very seriously - including teleworking and other factors aimed at limiting unnecessary transport and travel."
"Concerning the economic impact, we will take all aspects into account and will make proposals."
"However, we should be careful."
"Money does not come from nowhere, and things must be fair for all the other actors in the economy."
"We must be very balanced in our approach."
"There can be no miracle."
"As regards passengers' rights, the rules are very clear."
"Some Members asked about the rules and whether we should revisit them."
"I do not think we should revisit the rules adopted by European decision makers, including the European Parliament."
"They are good."
"The question is a very different one."
"It is that of implementation and enforcement, which is in the hands of Member States."
"We have a clear plan on how to proceed with the enforcement of these rules and on how to influence the Member States."
"It is clear what must be done concerning passengers' rights today."
"One other matter, which is not such a big issue: many colleagues and the press have said we were too late and were not prepared."
"Well, I was active all the time."
"I was at Eurocontrol."
"I was in contact with ministers."
"In this Chamber today, you have the same dilemma as faced by all those experts and decision makers, but this is a matter which is in the hands of experts and the safety authorities, not in the hands of politicians."
"It is the same dilemma: safety versus flexibility."
"We were prepared for a volcanic eruption but we had different types of evidence regarding the eruption."
"This was mentioned here as well."
"One British Airways flight and one KLM flight were affected by the volcanic eruption, so rules were established on the basis of there being a serious risk."
"The authorities acted in accordance with the assumption that there was a serious risk and that flights should be cancelled."
"Now we have a more differentiated approach."
"On Sunday, the majority of the test flights were made and information came through to Eurocontrol, where we discussed these issues - the test flights and the definitive results for those flights."
"Now we have flexibility and the matter is still in the hands of the Member States."
"We are going ahead with the Single Sky, which is a very promising European project, and there is a common understanding among ministers that this is the way forward, with better coordination at Europe level."
"This is a big opportunity."
"Those are the comments I wanted to make."
"I wanted to say that, as regards information, the Commission issued press releases on Thursday and Friday concerning passengers' rights."
"We said that passengers' rights should be taken very seriously."
"The information about passengers' rights came from the Commission immediately, and as from Sunday, larger coverage began of all the issues which, by yesterday, were very well covered."
"That is the picture."
"The case is not closed."
"We have three or four days at least before the majority of flights resume."
"The solution for the economy and for passengers is a resumption of flights, with airlines bringing passengers home or taking them to their final destination."
"It is still a difficult situation and we must deal with the consequences."
"Thank you for your remarks."
"We will have several opportunities to discuss this matter further."
"The debate which we are now ending was, certainly, the most important item of our proceedings."
"If only because of this debate, it was worth meeting here in Strasbourg."
"This discussion is something which our citizens expect - that we should deal with these problems, and it is just this which we have been talking about since the morning."
"It is the most important topic."
"I would also like to express my thanks for the fact that 14 Commissioners from the European Commission have taken part in our final debate."
"It is very important that they have listened to your remarks."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Although thanks to the intervention of the aviation authorities, the volcanic ash cloud fortunately did not cost human lives, the level of information and coordination in Europe gets a failing grade."
"The closure of the skies caused difficulties for hundreds of thousands of Europeans, preventing them from reaching their destinations."
"Everyone is trying to deal with the unexpected problem, but the inadequate provision of information aggravated the situation."
"Often, passengers were not provided with adequate information either by telephone or via the Internet."
"Confusion was further caused by the fact that the aviation authorities and airlines issued contradictory information."
"There was also a lack of coordination between air and ground transport."
"We experienced personally how important it would be to modernise public transport links between Member States and to develop trans-European transport networks."
"I welcome the Commission's decisive crisis management steps."
"The working group created to this end ought to reinforce coordination between aviation and air traffic control authorities, and it would be worth examining the continued validity of safety measures introduced in the 1980s as well."
"I recommend that in similar crisis situations, the European Parliament should not complicate an already chaotic transport system by commuting between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Instead, it should hold its plenary sessions in Brussels."
"Mr President, our debate on the situation of European aviation must not be restricted to the trivial matter of how to get to the part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"Concentrating too much on this aspect will give the impression of an unjustified egocentricity on the part of Members of the European Parliament."
"We should use our imagination."
"The social, economic and even political effects of keeping European airspace closed for a longer period may prove to be a colossal challenge for the whole of Europe."
"In Poland, some politicians and journalists are asking, for example, why some people could not get to Krakow on Sunday, while others did get there."
"They are also asking why it was not possible to get to Krakow by road or rail on Sunday, but it was possible to get to Strasbourg by these means on Monday."
"Events which happened as a consequence of the volcanic eruption in Iceland are also going to have a very strong global dimension."
"We do not usually think about the huge significance of air transport."
"Ethiopia's losses alone, which result from the fact that it is not possible to export flowers to Europe, amount to EUR 3 million a day."
"We must make a very serious analysis of how closing the skies will affect the labour market, our competitiveness and the whole economy, and how it will affect the lives of ordinary people."
"Who knows - it may be that this inconspicuous event in Iceland will determine the future of the European Union. Thank you very much."
"As a result of the limitations and cancellations of flights for several days on account of the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, thousands of people are stuck at airports under difficult conditions."
"Despite considerable flight delays (in cases of trips under 1500 km, over 2 hours), the airlines have provided little or no assistance and did not give accurate information regarding travel options to people's final destinations."
"They did not make arrangements for passengers to have access to free telephone, fax, e-mail or Internet facilities, and did not provide transfer or accommodation, either, even though passengers are entitled to such support under the EU regulations in force."
"Passengers living with disabilities, elderly people and families with small children are even more vulnerable in such exceptional situations, and this has been the case now as well."
"This unexpected situation has shown that passenger rights that were previously honoured can be wiped out in a matter of minutes, and that the need for the Passengers' Charter that I, too, had earlier urged is particularly great, to avoid a repetition of the helplessness of the airlines and relevant bodies."
"At the same time, I recommend that in the event of any exceptional change, it be automatically mandatory to send information and a message about alternative solutions to every passenger's mobile phone."
"The volcanic cloud caused by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano EyjafjÃ¶ll has been effective in disrupting air traffic over Europe in the last few days."
"To date, tens of thousands of flights have been cancelled, making it impossible for passengers to travel."
"For the whole of Europe, and for national and EU authorities, this is a lesson from which we must draw conclusions for the future, including so that similar events in the future do not paralyse the work of the European Council or of our assembly."
"Amongst those affected were also Members of the European Parliament, who were, as I was, unable to come to the Strasbourg part-session this week."
"A great deal of controversy has surrounded our meeting in Strasbourg this week, because some Members simply could not get to it from their constituencies."
"We did not know until the last minute if the part-session would be held at all."
"It would be good for all of us to have procedures in place in future so that we would be ready if faced with similar exceptional situations."
"Mr President, the news has accustomed us to scourges, natural or wilfully caused, that bring a nation's structures and society to its knees, creating transport and supply emergencies."
"Funds made available from the European budget and coordination among various civil protection bodies are already in operation, thanks to the experience acquired."
"An emergency such as the one caused by the Icelandic volcano was never expected, however."
"Our citizens will not forget the airport notice boards showing every single flight cancelled, the prison, day after day, that was the airport transit areas, and the interminable queues at stations, car rental companies and taxi ranks."
"The airlines have suffered the greatest financial losses."
"The citizens risk being made fools of: aside from the inconvenience and the unforeseen costs that will be difficult to recoup, air fares may be increased to offset the losses incurred."
"This possibility must be avoided."
"Just as it does for natural disasters, the European Union will have to respond by compensating citizens who have incurred unforeseen costs in an effort to minimise their discomfort, along with the airlines, but in so doing, it must avoid the risk of describing such compensation as State aid, and hence unlawful aid."
"The citizens, above all, must receive assurances that the European Union will help them, so they feel protected, both directly and indirectly."
"Until now, many still cannot admit that they feel protected."
"From Parliament, which is drastically reduced by the absence of many Members who are unable to get here, we call for the urgent adoption of a European action plan of coordination between national governments and bodies and an organised form of protection of the citizens."
"In this way, we would obtain that swift response to the needs of the citizens that the governments have been strangely unable to guarantee today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the last few days, we have all been witnesses of the blockade of airports throughout almost the whole of the continent of Europe."
"The situation is unusual, because it is not the result of strikes, but of a natural disaster caused by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland."
"This paralysis, in which we are all to some extent involved, has brought with it a series of consequences, such as the financial problems of airlines and a growth in the significance of land and maritime transport."
"It is this to which I would like to draw your attention."
"In recent years, air transport has had a clear lead over other means of transport."
"It was faster, safer and more convenient for passengers."
"However, in the present situation, it is essential to introduce measures which will allow land and maritime transport to compensate us better for the inconvenience caused by the paralysis of air transport."
"No justification is required for air traffic security."
"Since the volcanic eruption in Iceland, travelling by air not only appears not to be a viable option, but almost an impossibility as well."
"I strongly believe that more coordination at European level would have helped EU citizens stuck at various airports across the world or completely unable to set off on their planned trips."
"I hope that the single European sky will become a reality one day."
"As you are well aware, the complete ban on flights over the last few days has also affected our Parliament, or rather the operation of its plenary sessions."
"I think that there is no justification for postponing the vote and reducing the session by a day, even though only roughly 65% of MEPs were present on Monday evening, 19 April."
"In my view, the session must be held as normal."
"Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2010 (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by Mr Barroso, the President of the European Commission, on the Legislative and Work Programme of the Commission for 2010."
"I would like to stress that a good number of Commissioners are also present in the Chamber."
"The whole European Commission is strongly represented, because the subject is extremely important for all of us."
"We have had to curtail the subject somewhat, because of the change to the order of business, and after listening to what Mr Barroso has to say, we will hear speeches from the chairs of the political groups, who will give a political opinion on what the Commission is proposing for 2010."
"Then we will ask Mr Barroso to speak again and to respond to the comments of the chairs of the political groups."
"President Barroso, thank you for coming."
"It has not been easy for any of us to get to Strasbourg."
"Many Members have not arrived at the European Parliament, so the attendance is not very high."
"We decided not to vote during this part-session because everybody must have the opportunity to vote, and some Members could not come to Strasbourg at all."
"So there are some quite new rules for this part-session."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting to you today the first work programme of this Commission."
"It is also the first work programme since the Treaty of Lisbon came into effect."
"I have the honour and the pleasure of presenting it alongside practically my entire team, the European Commission, as a sign of respect for your Parliament."
"This programme is being presented at a decisive moment for Europe, since it is now that we must act."
"This programme is the direct outcome of our political dialogue."
"After intensive consultations based on the political guidelines that I presented for the next five years, this Parliament entrusted me, in September, with the responsibility of a second mandate."
"At the end of in-depth hearings that allowed us to forge a common vision of the actions presented, the College as a whole received your vote of confidence in February."
"In other words, this work programme is very much in line with the political priorities expressed by your institution."
"This being so, it provides a solid platform for achieving ambitious results."
"Our very first priority must be to emerge from the crisis and to lay the foundations for sustainable, job-creating growth."
"First, the urgent issues: we recently debated the results of the European Council."
"Meanwhile, the proposed financial support mechanism for Greece was finally put in place on 11 April."
"The Commission will play an important role in the implementation of this mechanism when Greece asks for it to be activated."
"This is the logical consequence of the fact that the Commission is deeply involved, and has been since the beginning, in the search for a solution to the financial problems encountered by Greece and in preserving stability within the euro area."
"Our involvement has always been in line with the principle of solidarity, but also of responsibility."
"However, we must do more and ask ourselves why these problems have occurred and how they can be prevented in future."
"That is why we are reviewing the Stability and Growth Pact in order to strengthen economic supervision and to extend it beyond the sole issue of deficits."
"We need a permanent mechanism for resolving crises."
"In short, we must demonstrate that the European Union, and particularly the euro area, is able to rise to the present-day challenges, and we must make use of all the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That is why one of the Commission's first major initiatives in the coming month will be to present a communication on the increased coordination of economic policies."
"We all know that the collective interest of Europe is at stake here."
"The Union must strengthen the system and take into consideration the whole spectrum of risks and economic imbalances."
"We need to improve internal mechanisms."
"By providing itself with more robust structures and with a more coordinated approach, Europe can help public finances embark on a new and viable path and can create a framework that is conducive to a broader, sustainable recovery."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 18 months, we have made enormous progress towards putting in place a financial system that is more ethical, robust and responsible."
"We must continue along this path, plug the last remaining gaps in the regulations, and make sure that our supervisory structures remain in phase with a sector that is constantly evolving."
"I am convinced that our proposal on hedge funds and private equity will soon reach a decisive stage."
"The Commission believes that the legislative authority will come round to our common objective, which is to ensure that the new European supervisory architecture for the financial sector becomes fully operational from the beginning of next year."
"In 2010, the Commission intends to present several proposals in key areas, such as the derivatives markets, deposit-guarantee systems and market abuses."
"The protection of ordinary consumers of financial services will receive special attention."
"We shall also be working on other major aspects linked to currency-default swaps (CDS) and bear sales, and we shall shortly be proposing some guidelines on the use of funds for resolving banking failures."
"Mr President, distinguished Members of Parliament, this Commission hit the ground running."
"By presenting the Europe 2020 strategy right after taking office, we have set the scene to help bring Europe back on track - on track for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"We now need to work together - European Parliament, Member States, Commission - to build and sustain the momentum."
"Achieving the vision of a sustainable social market economy by 2020 will require a strong effort from all levels of decision making and all levels of society."
"At European level, our action must have genuine European added-value."
"This is the goal of the Europe 2020 flagship initiatives - the Digital Agenda for Europe, a fully-fledged industrial policy, a European Plan for research and innovation, a resource-efficient Europe, new skills for new jobs, 'Youth on the move', fighting social exclusion."
"This is where Europe can make the difference."
"Thus, we will help drive the transition to a resource efficient and climate change resilient economy."
"Fighting climate change will remain a top priority on our agenda, both internally and globally."
"The energy and transport sectors will get particular attention this year - both critical to turn the challenge of a sustainable Europe into our competitive advantage."
"The Single Market, as a home market of 500 million consumers underpinning jobs, competitiveness, affordable prices and consumer choice, will continue to constitute the backbone of the European economy."
"Tapping its full potential is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the most important driver for job creation in the European Union."
"Bringing the single market into the 21st century is a priority for the Commission, which will make new proposals by 2012."
"This is also the subject of a report which I have asked Mario Monti to prepare and which we will be presenting very soon."
"I want to underline the importance of social inclusion in our vision for Europe 2020."
"The real strength of a society rests on the opportunities it creates for its weakest citizens."
"We must seize every opportunity to encourage employment and social cohesion."
"That means being ready to exploit the emerging sectors which will generate new jobs."
"It means providing people with the right skills to create and sustain high employment levels and facilitate economic transition."
"It means working to overcome the impact of the crisis on young people by easing transitions from education and training to work."
"To this end, a broad-ranged European Platform against Poverty will be built on the current European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"This agenda is, of course, a contribution to the fulfilment of our principles of economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"The concerns and well-being of European citizens will remain at the heart of Commission action."
"The implementation of a comprehensive Action Plan of the Stockholm Programme that the Commission will be adopting later today is focused precisely on ensuring that the benefits of European integration in the area of freedom, security and justice become more tangible to the citizens."
"This Action Plan represents, on its own, a comprehensive work programme for the Commission in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It puts citizens at the core of our policies by facilitating the exercise of their specific rights."
"It will also aim at developing an open and secure Europe with a particular focus on tackling cross-border crime and on a common immigration and asylum policy."
"In the field of freedom, security and justice, the European Union has, in the last 10 years, gone from the application of the free circulation of persons to a common policy."
"The achievements until now have been impressive but we need, more than ever in this period of exit from the crisis, to promote and defend European values and indeed, above all, to tap all the potential that is now created by the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Action Plan contains a comprehensive list of measures to implement our already defined priorities in this field, both at European and global level."
"The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty also gives us the tools to demonstrate greater ambition."
"The increased role of this Parliament, more efficient decision making in the Council, the perspective of more coherence and consistency of Member States in European Council decisions, and the judicial review by the Court of Justice will strengthen European Union determination in responding to the expectations and concerns of our citizens."
"When we look to 2020, we must also address a number of long-term trends with a direct impact on the daily lives of citizens."
"Action now will pay dividends in the future."
"For example, the Commission will launch a public debate on the future of pensions and analyse options for ensuring the sustainability and adequacy of the pension systems."
"Of course, in any area like this, many of the levers are national - but that must not hold us back from ensuring that the European Union makes a maximum contribution."
"In the external field, the new role of the High Representative/Vice-President and the start of the European External Action Service will offer us the tools to build a stronger and more coherent EU external policy."
"We will set out strategic trade policy priorities, take forward trade negotiations and work with partners on issues ranging from market access to regulatory framework and global imbalances."
"We will project our Europe 2020 objectives on the global market place, for example, through the G20."
"The Commission will also be tackling the challenges of energy geopolitics, in order to ensure safe, secure, sustainable and affordable energy."
"Another key priority for the Commission is to pursue the international development agenda and propose an EU action plan in the run-up to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals summit."
"This initiative will form the basis for the June European Council to prepare a common EU position in view of the High Level United Nations Review meeting in September on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which aims at the adoption of a Global Action Plan for reaching the MDGs by 2015."
"We want a Europe that is open and shows in concrete actions its solidarity with the most vulnerable in the world."
"Finally, as agreed with this Parliament, we will publish the Budget Review during the third semester of this year."
"In this, we will set out what we see as the key principles and parameters for using the European Union's financial resources to best effect, taking full account of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In parallel, we will be making more detailed assessments of key areas, including agriculture and cohesion."
"I can assure you that Parliament will be fully associated at all stages of the budget review."
"Before finishing, I would like to briefly explain a number of innovations in the work programme."
"This programme, and future programmes, needs to offer the right framework for the institutions to build a solid consensus on where Europe should concentrate its attention."
"We therefore need to be more political, and we also need to reflect the multiannual challenge of initiatives of the scale we intend."
"I think the way we will prepare the work programmes in the future should be a concrete demonstration of the special partnership which I and the Commission want to establish with the European Parliament in this mandate."
"This programme identifies 34 strategic initiatives that we are committed to putting on the table before the end of December."
"I am sure you agree that this is an ambitious agenda for the next eight months."
"At the same time, the programme includes many other initiatives for 2010 and beyond."
"This indicative list comprises initiatives on which the Commission intends to work over the coming years."
"Not all of these initiatives will necessarily lead to the submission of concrete proposals."
"In line with the principles of smart regulation, we need to assess thoroughly which items should go forward, and in which form."
"The work programme will be reviewed every year to identify new strategic initiatives and adapt the multiannual strand as required."
"This 'rolling' approach will enhance transparency and predictability for all stakeholders, while preserving the necessary flexibility to react to unforeseen developments."
"One thing we have learned in recent years is that we should always predict the unpredictable."
"Recent years have shown that strategic blueprints cannot be cast in stone - they have to adapt to reality on the ground."
"Honourable Members, the Commission work programme for 2010 that we are proud to present today is an ambitious, but also necessary and realistic, framework for European policy making in the coming year."
"It is realistic if all institutions are ready to join forces and cooperate with a view to delivering timely results to Europe's citizens; it is necessary because business as usual is not an option if we want 2010 to mark a turning point; and it is ambitious because, more than ever, a strong Europe is required to deliver to citizens the solutions they are looking for."
"They expect it from us, and we have a duty to work for their prosperity and well-being."
"Thank you, Mr Barroso, for a comprehensive presentation of the Commission's most important initiatives for the next eight months."
"I would just like to stress that the strategic partnership of which you spoke is very important to us."
"We distinguish between executive and legislative authority, but our cooperation is of crucial significance for our citizens, so it is with great pleasure that we have listened to your words about the necessity for contact between the Commission and Parliament to be as close as possible."
"Your presence, and the presence of the Commissioners, during this sitting today is the best evidence that the intentions of the Commission agree with the facts. Thank you very much for this."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (HU) Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we welcome the fact that the Commission has ambitiously set to work and presented its 2010 work programme."
"We take this in the spirit in which it was meant, that the Commission is present, and as a sign of respect for Parliament, of taking Parliament seriously, and we are glad that they are all present."
"At the same time, we regret that much time has already been wasted this year, since the delay in the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon has already prevented the harmonisation of the legislative programme and the budget from being made this year."
"We have every confidence that this process can be restored in 2011 after overcoming minor difficulties."
"The Treaty of Lisbon came into force, and henceforth we can no longer make any excuses, as Members of the European Parliament, nor does the Commission or the Council, for not taking decisive action and not starting the work, that is, implementing that which the Treaty of Lisbon prescribes and fulfilling what citizens want, placing them at the centre of our policy plans."
"The European People's Party prepared two lists with regard to the Commission's plans."
"We sent the details to you even before acceptance."
"The two lists, which I would like now to cite briefly, consist simply of a list of what the Commission should not do, and a list that itemises what we would like them to do."
"First, we would like to ask that the Commission not do what has been the practice till now, because that would render this debate meaningless, namely, that by October, only 40% of your legislative proposals for the year had been tabled."
"If this continues to be the case in the future, then these sorts of debates are pointless."
"Parliament cannot exercise the right by which it wishes to make an impact on what proposals the Commission should put forward."
"It is for this reason that we consider it important that these legislative proposals or work programmes are not considered on a par with the old Communist five-year plans, in which nothing, from start to finish, was true."
"And what they eventually achieved had nothing whatsoever to do with the final objectives."
"The other things we ask of the Commission is not to tolerate lies and deception."
"At the moment, several European countries are in crisis because they concealed the correct data, and lied about the size of the budget deficit."
"They concealed this information from the others, and yet we are all in the same boat, and such things affect many people."
"This was the case in Hungary, this was the case in Greece."
"In such cases, we expect the Commission not to shrink back, but to name and shame such countries decisively, or else there will be much more trouble later."
"The renowned nineteenth century thinker of the Hungarian age of reform, Count SzÃ©chenyi, said that anyone who covers up trouble increases it."
"So we should not cover it up, but come forward with it, and, on that basis, take the necessary decisive action."
"The Commission ought to exercise its competence in this regard."
"Do not misunderstand me."
"I am not saying that the Commission is to blame for these crises."
"The governments of these countries are responsible for these crises; however, in the interest of the common good, we should have raised our voices louder and more decisively in order to see results."
"Now let us move on to what the Commission should do."
"First of all, it should at last take action and decisions, and should develop an ambitious job creation programme."
"It should place citizens at the centre of our work."
"Jobs, jobs, jobs must be our guiding principle."
"Let me start here by saying that naturally, when we address citizens, we need to use a language that they understand."
"When we say 2020, then I - an MEP from a former Communist country - associate this once again with the five-year plan, or the sort of number they used to assign to prisoners."
"Why do we not call the 2020 programme the European Union's job creation programme, why do we not call the Stockholm Programme - a name that, by the way, no one besides us understands - the European citizen security programme?"
"What I mean to say is that the words we use are also an important part of the start of this entire process."
"We consider it important that small and medium-sized enterprises take an active part in the process of job creation."
"They would not like it if the 2020 job creation programme was shoved down Parliament's throat."
"We need a thorough debate here, and not just in this Parliament but in the national parliaments, and the national decision-making authorities must be involved as well."
"Let us learn from the failure of the Lisbon Programme - yet another name that no one understands!"
"Let us work for the security of our citizens and let us take the steps necessary in this regard."
"Mr President, just one observation: man does not live by bread alone - strengthening our common values is also important."
"We expect the Commission to continue those value-based programmes which deal with Communism, with the coexistence of national minorities, and with Europe's common past."
"The European People's Party will support you, but we will criticise you very severely if you deviate from the original programme."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioners, I would like to thank so many of you for attending today."
"Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about my fellow Members."
"I am ashamed to say that not all of those who are not here are genuinely not here."
"They are in Strasbourg, but they are not in the Chamber where they should be."
"I find that very sad."
"As we do not have a joint resolution, we will present our individual points to you and you can evaluate them in detail."
"Mr Barroso, we agree with you that the main issue is competitiveness combined with social security in a sustainable Europe."
"Of course, our main emphasis must be on continuing to combat poverty and unemployment, which is still rising in some areas or, at the very least, remains unacceptably high."
"I would like to thank you for mentioning this, as it is something which some Heads of Government seem not to be convinced of."
"How can we ensure that this happens in an era of budgetary consolidation?"
"It goes without saying that we must consolidate our budgets."
"However, this must be kept in proportion - I would ask the Commission to take note of this - and it must take place in chronological order, in order to ensure that the other essential objectives, in other words, combating unemployment and poverty, are not left in ruins."
"I would like to take this opportunity to say how important this issue is, against the background of the recent Roma summit in Cordoba, at which you were not present, but which two members of the Commission attended, Mrs Reding, the Vice-President of the Commission, and Mr Andor, the Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion."
"I have recently visited Roma settlements in Serbia and it is inconceivable that places like this still exist in Europe."
"I call on the Commission to do everything within its power to combat the problem of poverty and unemployment in this area."
"My next point relates to the budgetary consolidation."
"We need more investment."
"We discussed this earlier on this morning with Mr Kallas."
"We have invested too little, for example, in the trans-European networks."
"Now it is possible to see where the problems have arisen because we still have not implemented what was proposed in the so-called Delors Plan."
"When you talk about partnership, Mr Barroso, I would ask you to remember that we need this partnership, particularly with regard to the budget issue and future budget planning, because it is clear that the Council is already intending to make cuts in smaller items at a European level."
"We cannot tolerate this."
"Mr Barroso, you referred to the Monti report."
"This is definitely an important report and it is good that you have asked Mr Monti to prepare it, as he is an expert in this area."
"However, when we talk about the single market, we must also refer to the social market economy."
"In this context, public services in particular are very important to us."
"You have agreed to submit proposals for a framework directive."
"We do not want to cover all the individual points here and now, but I believe that we will have to rely on these public services for the European identity, in particular, with regard to the transport problems that we have had, which indicate, for example, how important public rail services are."
"Regardless of whether they are provided by the private or the public sector, they must be regulated and safeguarded by a common European policy for public services."
"I would now like to come to my final and decisive point."
"You spoke about the economic crisis and also about Greece and other countries which are in difficulties."
"In our previous discussions with Mr Van Rompuy, we established that the actions taken by the European Council in this case did not represent the best that Europe can offer."
"If all of this had been done two or three months ago, Greece would not have had to make high interest payments."
"You referred to this, but I believe that we need more than references."
"We need the Commission to call for these things with a powerful voice."
"I agree with you that this is not about intervening when the crisis has already happened and the deficits are sky-high, because this fact is frequently misunderstood."
"It is about preventing these things from happening as far as possible by monitoring economic and budgetary changes."
"Once again, I can hear governments saying that we cannot investigate their statistics or their budgetary procedure."
"This is not acceptable."
"If we want to prevent what has happened in recent months and years from occurring again, then we must do this."
"Why do governments have to keep their statistics and their budget procedures secret?"
"Of course, governments must have a certain freedom."
"They must have this freedom and, in the euro area in particular, it must correspond with the European objectives and targets."
"Mr Barroso, we are ready to enter into the special partnership that you referred to."
"However, this partnership must be based on a strong position for Parliament and for the Commission."
"In the days to come, we will be negotiating on the framework agreement."
"It specifies some of the details, but the decisive factor is the spirit behind it."
"This also involves you stating clearly, when some Heads of Government want to misuse the Treaty of Lisbon in order to strengthen their own position, that the Treaty of Lisbon is intended to strengthen Europe."
"This is why the Commission must have a powerful voice."
"In this case, we will go along with you and support you, even if our opinions on individual details differ."
"However, we must both fight for a strong Europe."
"This is very important, particularly in the light of the recent behaviour of some Heads of Government."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, I find this programme perhaps overly tentative in view of today's upheavals and challenges, and I believe that we are entitled to expect greater ambition from the Commission, all the more so given that you committed yourself to this."
"On financial regulation first of all, I fully understand what Mr Barnier is trying to do."
"It is along the right lines, but I believe that we could have gone further and considered other avenues, such as the separation of banking activities, the taxation of financial movements or a pure and simple ban on derivative products, as is being contemplated today in the United States."
"However - and, for me, this is more important still - I believe that we absolutely must do everything we can to promote the real economy and sustainable investment which, unlike the current, extremely financial services-driven economy, actually creates employment."
"I would very much like it if we worked on concrete projects along those lines."
"I cannot see any such projects in this programme today."
"I also believe that we need far-reaching projects."
"If ever there was a time to revive the idea of a Europe of the railways, it is today, with the crisis that we have gone through."
"At present, we have 28 000 flights each day in the European Union."
"This really is the time to revive this Europe of the railways that has been spoken about for decades."
"However, I believe that nothing will be achieved without genuine economic coordination and economic governance."
"From this point of view, I regret that the Council is in charge of a working group on this issue;"
"I would have preferred it to have been your Commission."
"We urgently need budgetary, economic and industrial coordination."
"We need to create a European monetary fund and, alongside it, to implement measures for stabilising the Member States' public finances."
"Although it is a word that is no longer used, we need to work towards fiscal convergence."
"I am thinking in particular of the issue of corporate taxation."
"Moreover, we will need to work on an own resource for the EU budget."
"I believe that these would be powerful acts that might well put us back on the path to growth."
"I would like to say one more thing about the future economic strategy of the Union for 2020: please, do not give up quantified objectives in relation to poverty and education."
"I believe that, from this point of view, you will have the support of the entire European Parliament."
"We are talking here about the European social model that we want and that we love."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Commissioners, I would also have liked Parliament to respond to the respect that you have shown it with a higher level of attendance."
"We will have to work on this."
"The work programme that you have presented is very wide-ranging and contains headings that sound very ambitious."
"Even the introduction has the title 'A new era'."
"However, I am not sure that the details underneath these major headings do justice to this positive-sounding approach."
"This is still all about the climate crisis and the financial and economic crisis."
"The case of Greece has once again demonstrated that we not only have a growing divide in economic terms, but also in social terms, because the conditions in which European citizens live in the south, the east and the north-west are very different."
"This means that we are facing major challenges."
"I have to agree with Mr Swoboda in particular when it comes to a social Europe and more justice."
"It is essential that there is a review of this area. We are not at all convinced that what is currently on the table is enough to combat the growing poverty within the European Union."
"Have we drawn the right conclusions from the financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis?"
"We believe that the right approach to financial and economic integration is to make new proposals for modifying corporation tax."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have long since been in favour of taking this further."
"We also support energy taxation."
"You will be able to rely on us if you finally put this into practice."
"However, on the basis of our experience of the financial crisis, we believe that a clear objective for the tax on financial transactions is still lacking."
"Of course, we can say that we are waiting for the Member States, but I believe that sometimes you must present more specific and more precise demands and then fight for them, and this is also what Mr SzÃ¡jer has said."
"It is clear that our response to the Greek situation has been inadequate."
"We do not think it is acceptable that no proposal is now being made on Eurobonds."
"Mr Barroso, you put a very great emphasis on services of general interest during your campaign for a second period of office."
"The groups in Parliament have also asked you about this."
"I think that what you have said about public services and how they should be regulated under the heading 'Putting people at the heart of European action' is completely inadequate."
"This means that you are already breaking one of your major promises."
"As far as protecting the climate is concerned, the various Directorates-General which are currently involved with climate protection are working on scenarios with different objectives for 2050."
"In the case of transport, there is a long-term goal of a 70% reduction, but for energy it is 75%."
"Mrs Hedegaard's people have not yet decided."
"I hope that they will set more ambitious objectives."
"However, it is clear that Bali and the two-degree goal do not play a role for any of the Directorates-General."
"What use is all the talk about a major new European climate diplomacy initiative if we have obviously given up on Bali and on the agreements made by the G8?"
"The contents of the programme will not be enough to allow us to make a successful European appearance in Bonn, in CancÃºn or in South Africa."
"There is still a lot to do."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, talking of programmes, let me remind you of the lesson of the 1992 programme: for the Commission to achieve results, it needs to set one priority and focus on one policy at a time."
"The effort to establish the single market was a worthwhile objective which could be easily understood by all those involved - and, crucially, by the public - but since then, all too frequently, we have seen the Commission launching initiative after initiative, regardless of whether Europe was the appropriate forum or whether it could really deliver tangible benefits, in the futile hope that they would make it popular."
"That approach was wrong and it failed."
"We therefore welcome the new direction which has been developed by President Barroso."
"The European economy is still in deep crisis, and only consistent action will change that situation."
"I do not simply refer to the immediate crisis triggered by the failure of the banking system, or the extra pressures now provided by transport emergencies."
"I mean the underlying crisis which has seen the European economy left behind by more competitive and innovative economies across the Atlantic and in Asia."
"We therefore strongly support the centre-piece initiative of this Commission: the 2020 strategy."
"Whilst we believe there are details to be added and changes which should be made, the broad thrust of the policy is correct."
"Europe needs strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth which can deliver high levels of employment, productivity and social inclusion - hear, hear!"
"This must be the overriding priority defining the Commission."
"Our future economic prosperity and all the benefits it can generate depend on successful businesses and entrepreneurs; they are the ones who create wealth and sustainable productive jobs, and that is the best anti-poverty policy yet invented."
"The Commission must be their ally, not their adversary."
"We therefore welcome the commitments to relaunch the single market, extending it further, to emphasise smart regulation, to ensure that the implementation of rules is consistent and fair throughout the Union, to reduce substantially the administrative burden and cut down on red tape and address bottlenecks, to share best practice in training, to modernise the labour market and to reduce barriers to trade."
"In taking a lead in developing a vibrant, dynamic European economy, President Barroso will have our support."
"We do not, of course, like everything."
"We are concerned that some measures might result in infringements of the rights and responsibilities of Member States, such as the concept of a Citizens' Europe or some aspects of the Stockholm Programme."
"We are encouraged by the prospect of reform in the common agricultural and fisheries policies, but concerned this may result in more bureaucracy rather than a fair solution for our farmers and fishermen."
"Finally, we do not agree that common initiatives undertaken by Member States in the field of foreign affairs should be totally taken over by the Commission rather than left to the Council."
"The ECR was founded to uphold the principle of subsidiarity; we want a Europe which focuses on its proper key tasks and delivers real benefits, and we are hopeful that President Barroso and his Commission - all of whom are here, one for each of us, today - seize the opportunity evident in much of the work programme presented to nurture a Europe playing its part in shaping an economic recovery and can offer a foundation for our long-term prosperity in the difficult and challenging years ahead."
"Mr President, the title of the programme that we are discussing here today is: 'Time to Act'."
"When it took five days to organise a videoconference among Union ministers, I can only congratulate you on your sense of humour, Mr Barroso."
"Why, though, is it time to act?"
"Is it because no one has acted yet and the title is a piece of self-criticism?"
"Or is it because this title, like all the other titles of our bureaucratic communications, is just an empty promise hiding behind piles of words?"
"I will give you an example."
"We are in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, although the poor do not know about it."
"Your paper talks about an initiative - and I quote - 'to ensure that the benefits of growth and jobs are widely shared'."
"Is that another joke?"
"What initiative is that, and how can it make up for the social support that Member States are withdrawing for the sake of their stability programmes?"
"How does the Commission intend to share the benefits of something that does not exist: economic growth?"
"How does it intend to reduce the number of poor people without touching the income of the rich and the very rich?"
"Our disagreement with you is about policy."
"A return to the dictatorship of the deficit traps economies, cuts wages, cuts benefits and forces public investment into retreat."
"That is a recipe for more unemployment."
"Although it is time to act, the Commission thinks that the Union has, in the end, been able to join forces to confront the crisis."
"Ask the Greeks whether that is what they think, whether we have been quick and whether we have been fair."
"When will we have the European credit rating agency?"
"Ask the Portuguese, whose debt interest goes up every time a Commissioner decides to talk about economics."
"Ask the European public."
"Ask the European public why things are as they are and they will look at the messenger and end up smiling, because in the end, there is no tax on a sense of humour."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, enterprises, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up 99% of Europe's productive fabric, need four fundamental elements: easier access to credit, greater labour market flexibility, less bureaucracy when it comes to opening up and managing businesses, and, lastly, protection from unfair competition."
"We value the work done by the Commission to streamline European legislation with the annulment of 1 600 legislative acts during the last term of office, and we support the proposals made by the high-level group led by Edmund Stoiber."
"Another important element for the competitiveness of businesses is the international trade situation."
"At this time of crisis, it is important to strengthen the European Union's trade defence system."
"Businesses cannot compete with social and environmental dumping strategies implemented by some emerging economies such as China, where the cost of labour is extremely low and where there are no social safeguards and their associated costs or high standards of environmental protection."
"Another issue on which the Commission should intervene more aggressively is the fight against counterfeiting and the protection of intellectual property rights."
"In short, I cannot see any initiatives in the Commission's work programme aimed at implementing the cohesion policy guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For the first time, Article 174 of the treaty recognises the specific role of mountain regions, which represent 40% of our territory and over 90 million European citizens."
"I therefore call on you to include in the Commission's next legislative programme a proposal for a framework programme to support the development of and to protect mountain regions, and to capitalise on all the possible uses for renewable energies that mountains offer."
"Mr President, in the Commission work programme for 2010, it was said that the European Union must face up to long-term challenges such as globalisation and must regain competitiveness."
"The problem is that the EU has not faced up to globalisation: it has embraced it."
"It is allowing a flood of imports from developing economies with wage rates a fraction of those in Europe."
"The only way in which we can possibly regain competitiveness would be to drive wage rates down to their levels."
"I am not, of course, even in favour of membership of the European Union."
"However, even if I were in favour of it, I would accuse its masters of betraying the economic interests of its peoples."
"I would say that the EU is not so much a European Union, as it is a global union trying to achieve the global mobility of all goods and services."
"I believe that sovereign nation states should rebuild their manufacturing bases and then protect their markets and the jobs of their nationals."
"However, my message is also for europhiles."
"Europe, either as a whole or separately, will fail to protect its manufacturing and its agriculture from Third World competition at its peril."
"Globalisation must be resisted, individually or collectively, or it will destroy us all."
"The Commission's document refers to the alleged need to develop further legal immigration policies to alleviate the perils of demographic ageing."
"There is no doubt that ageing populations are a concern in many countries."
"However, we must examine why the problems occurred."
"Many women pursue uninterrupted careers and refrain from having children out of choice - and that is their perfect right - but many others pursue careers because it is economically necessary for them."
"They work in order to pay the bills, not because they have a disdain for motherhood."
"There is no doubt that this development has had an impact on birth rates, which have been depressed artificially at the behest of economic forces."
"However, we do not have to take a laissez-faire approach to economic forces."
"Economic intervention can change those economic forces and a change in those forces will bring about a corresponding change in family demographics."
"The idea that we can import large families from the Third World as a substitute for unborn European children is based on a particularly pernicious and wrong-headed assumption, which is that we are the products of nurture and that Third World cultures are like overcoats that can be taken off at the port of entry and replaced with a European cultural overcoat that can be issued with residence and citizenship papers."
"The children of such immigrants are allegedly as European as the indigenous population; they are not."
"Distinctive cultures are made by distinctive peoples and not the other way round."
"We are not the product of our cultures: our cultures are the products of our peoples."
"Replacing Europeans with people from the Third World will mean that Europe will be replaced by the Third World."
"Europe is slowly but steadily being ethnically cleansed of Europeans."
"Mr President, in general - we are not talking about those who have said clearly and honestly that they are against the Union and against membership of the European Union - I feel able to say that there is, nonetheless, in this House, broad agreement on the programme that we have just presented."
"If there is one common factor that I have detected in the speeches of the most representative political groups, it is the idea of ambition."
"We need greater ambition in Europe."
"In this regard, I wish to take up a few ideas that have been voiced, ideas with which, I might add, I am in particular agreement."
"Our friend, Mr SzÃ¡jer, spoke of the need to avoid, in fact, the model of the five-year plan of the communist regimes."
"That is precisely why we want to maintain this flexibility, which is important if we are to adapt to a changing environment."
"At the same time, I would like to confirm once again, in response to Mr SzÃ¡jer, but also to Mr Swoboda, that they are right when they call for greater action from the EU in economic and financial terms, and when they point out how the Member States have resisted, for example, the Commission playing a greater role in the supervision of national public accounts."
"The first Commission of which I had the honour of being President presented a specific regulation aimed at giving greater audit powers to Eurostat, and that was rejected by certain Member States, which did not want the Commission to be able to play that role."
"I therefore hope that the lesson to be learnt from this crisis is that we are increasingly interdependent, that economic policy in Europe is not just a national matter."
"It is a national matter, of course, but it is also a matter of common European interests, since we need a greater degree of coordination."
"In this respect, I believe that Mr SzÃ¡jer, Mr Swoboda, Mrs De Sarnez and all the others are agreed on the need for such increasingly coordinated economic policy."
"This is how we make progress, and in this respect, I wish to highlight in particular the ambition expressed by Mr Swoboda - and I thank him - for an enhanced partnership between the Commission and the European Parliament when we talk about the financial perspective, about the need to resist certain rather intergovernmental interpretations that one hears nowadays."
"Such interpretations are surprising, because the Treaty of Lisbon is, in fact, the exact opposite of intergovernmentalism: it strengthens the European dimension."
"I hope that we will be able to learn lessons from this crisis by moving in the direction of more, not less, Europe."
"One example - to which Mrs De Sarnez referred - is the issue of financial regulation."
"It is, all the same, odd, not to say ironic, that after so many requests from certain Member States for measures in the field of financial regulation, the Member States unanimously agreed to reduce the ambition of the proposals that the Commission presented following the de LarosiÃ¨re report."
"This shows, therefore, that there is, at times, a gap between what is said and what is decided."
"I hope that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, will together be able to fill that gap in order to try to achieve a little more consistency at European level, because we do, in fact, need that ambition."
"The important thing now, I would stress, is to understand the principle of subsidiarity properly."
"I am in favour of subsidiarity."
"In this respect, I am also keen to voice my agreement, Mr Kirkhope, with this idea of subsidiarity, but it is important to have a proper understanding of what it means."
"Subsidiarity means deciding which level of decision making is best."
"On the subject of this air traffic crisis, the events taking place are, all the same, odd."
"I have seen today in the press - and not only in the Eurosceptic or Europhobe press, not only in the tabloids, but also in the quality press - that the European Union now admits that it was mistaken in deciding to suspend flights."
"That is unbelievable!"
"If there is one area that comes under national jurisdiction, it is European air traffic control."
"The decision was taken by each European national regulator."
"Yet the very people who are against European-level powers are now protesting against Europe."
"Soon, the talk will be that it was the European Commission and Brussels that created the volcano in Iceland."
"It is all really rather extraordinary."
"(Applause)"
"Let us be clear."
"There are different levels of responsibility: national levels and European levels."
"In each case, we have to see which is the most appropriate level."
"I can tell you that the Commission is ready to assume its responsibilities, but I believe that we must build an alliance with the European Parliament in order to state clearly what is, and what is not, our responsibility."
"Without this alliance, we will always have this instinctive need - and, in times of crisis, we know that it is easier to resort to nationalist, populist rhetoric - to place under the responsibility of Brussels, as is sometimes said, or perhaps of Strasbourg too, what is frankly a national responsibility."
"Let us show some common sense!"
"Let us concentrate on what we can do at European level, in areas where we can add value to our action, while respecting, of course, our Member States, which are democratic Member States."
"The 2020 agenda, I believe, focuses Europe on what is most important."
"What we need now is growth, but not just any old growth; we need fairer, more open, more sustainable and more intelligent growth that is focused on the future."
"We need to create new sources of growth in order to successfully tackle our biggest problem, which we shall be discussing this afternoon, namely, unemployment and, more specifically, youth unemployment."
"It is in this area, in fact, that we need to build this alliance between the European institutions, by also working honestly and loyally with our Member States to produce concrete results for our fellow citizens."
"I believe that in this regard, we have a good foundation for our work in the coming years and, after this debate, I feel encouraged - and I believe that my colleagues do too - by your words of support and, in certain cases, by your demands."
"We shall try to prove equal to the task with which you are entrusting us."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, for your statement."
"I would like to say that when it comes to the European Commission's efforts on behalf of our European Community, the Commission has a huge ally in the European Parliament."
"Most Members support these efforts and the view of the Commission that it should take on more responsibility, especially in the crisis situation which we spoke about earlier - it is then that we understand how much we need the European Union and action from the Commission."
"The responsibility of the European Parliament has also risen markedly with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and we are pleased about this."
"We think that this is good for Europeans - that it is good for our citizens."
"Now, we have to accept more responsibility and use the opportunities presented by the treaty."
"I would like to assure you once again, Mr Barroso, that you and the European Commission have allies, here, and I speak for the majority of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I just wanted to congratulate the Commission and its President, JosÃ© Manuel DurÃ£o Barroso, on the ambitious, very pro-European programme that he has presented here today, which is clearly in line with the objectives of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union and with the programme of the trio of presidencies made up of Spain, Belgium and Hungary."
"I can say that the Council is working with the Commission and also with the European Parliament, which I also congratulate on the constructive speeches made in support of the Commission's legislative programme."
"The Commission has worked very hard."
"Everyone knows that the new Commission - known as the Barroso II Commission - should have been in office since 1 November, but, for various reasons, it arrived a few months later, and is working hard to make up for lost time in a constructive, positive way, which the Spanish Presidency is grateful for."
"Mr Barroso and all the members of the Commission - vice-presidents and commissioners - are also aware that we are working with the Commission, I think in a very positive way, and we recognise its efforts in this respect."
"It is also grateful to the European Parliament."
"Whenever there has been a debate here on these issues, the European Parliament has always had a very constructive attitude."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask the European Parliament once again for these legislative initiatives to be adopted - today we are talking primarily about legislative initiatives - and for this to happen as soon as possible so that we can make up for the lost time that I was referring to."
"I am sure that we are going to have Parliament's cooperation as well."
"Thank you for your statement on behalf of the Council and your support for the Commission's programme."
"I would like, once again, to thank Mr Barroso, all the Vice-Presidents of the Commission and the Commissioners for their presence."
"This testifies to the fact that the Commission places great importance on cooperation with Parliament, which was also as we had hoped."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Commission's work programme for 2010 is an ambitious and flexible multiannual programme setting out the following main objectives: tackling the crisis and supporting Europe's social market economy, drawing up a citizens' agenda which puts people at the heart of Europe's activities, developing an ambitious and consistent foreign policy agenda with a global dimension and, last but not least, revamping the instruments and working methods used by the European Union."
"One key element of the citizens' agenda is the Stockholm Programme for 'an open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens', which was adopted by the European Council during its meeting in December 2009."
"I would like to welcome the Commission's initiative in presenting an action plan for implementing the Stockholm Programme so that we can ensure that European citizens will actually enjoy the benefits of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The programme will mainly focus on the fight against cross-border crime and will consolidate the enforcement of the common policy on immigration and asylum, covering, in particular, areas such as combating organised crime, terrorism and other threats through improving police and judicial cooperation."
"Currently, Europe is facing increasing unemployment and almost 17% of Europe's inhabitants are living below the poverty line."
"Each day, many Europeans, even those in employment, are struggling with poverty and do not have opportunities to enjoy life to the full, as the recession is even pushing many people on middle incomes towards poverty."
"Therefore, we must firstly focus particular attention on the problem of poverty facing those in work."
"To increase employment, we must create new jobs, not just any jobs, but try to ensure high quality employment, taking into account the demands of the labour market."
"Most attention should be paid to increasing youth unemployment, one of society's most acute problems."
"If young people are not given opportunities to enter the labour market, then the danger is that Europe will lose a whole generation of young people."
"For some time, Europe's demographic situation has also been forcing us to consider the employment of older people."
"We must provide for labour relations that promote employment and ensure the possibility of life-long learning."
"I would like to underline that we should also discuss the employment of disabled people."
"It is important to give them the conditions to join the labour market, not just because of demographic changes, but for themselves, to ensure their own sense of dignity and self-worth."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission how Europe will create new jobs?"
"What are the real chances for people to enter the labour market?"
"How can we ensure quality employment so that we can reduce the poverty of those in work?"
"The Commission work programme for 2010 consists of 14 pages of the usual commonplaces and platitudes."
"It is right that Europe must respond jointly to the crisis."
"However, this is a crisis which was only able to have such a negative effect on Europe because of Commission policy and unrestricted liberalisation in all areas."
"Nevertheless, no one wants to change anything."
"On the contrary, the further removal of trade restrictions which the Commission wants to push through will encourage globalisation, benefit large companies and cause damage to the Member States and their citizens."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is intended to be the response to the current crisis."
"As far as the specific measures are concerned, the approach to economic and financial policy seems sensible, as does the development of a new European supervision architecture for monitoring the financial markets."
"Stricter controls on public finances and budgetary discipline within the Member States will hopefully allow us to avoid problems in future, such as those which we are currently experiencing in Greece."
"The Commission's new tax plans, together with the review of the energy taxation directive, which involves taxing energy products on the basis of their energy content, should be rejected because climate change, which is primarily a natural phenomenon, cannot be resolved simply by focusing on CO2."
"In addition, this will put the European economy under even further pressure compared with its competitors in America and Asia, where no initiatives of this kind are planned."
"The Commission work programme for 2010 has established the right priorities."
"As well as modernising ways of working, which will be a decisive factor in stimulating the economy, and increasing the involvement of European citizens, the Commission is focusing primarily on combating the financial crisis."
"It is important that, in particular, those EU citizens who have lost their jobs during the current crisis are given new prospects for the future as quickly as possible."
"As the spokesperson on the environment for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I am concerned that we should create as many sustainable jobs as possible and provide added value on the labour market as a result of the leading role played by Europe in protecting the environment."
"In order to make the changeover to a new and sustainable industrial age, we should no longer regard job creation and comprehensive protection for the environment as mutually contradictory."
"In my view, the Commission has been somewhat cautious in taking up this approach. We need to be laying the foundations for this now."
"We will be able to achieve a great deal if we can improve the way in which existing regulations are applied."
"I congratulate Mr Barroso on the ambitious Commission legislative and work programme for 2010."
"Unfortunately, time is running out - there are already only eight months left."
"In spite of this, I hope the priorities will not be only empty promises."
"The strength of the programme is its measures for combating the crisis."
"Unfortunately, these concern mainly the economic situation."
"In the section on the citizens' agenda, there are no anti-discrimination initiatives, such as combating violence against women, greater determination and engagement in achieving social objectives and a long-term strategy for improving communication with the Union's citizens."
"We have been working on the phenomenon of violence against women for years."
"It is high time there were effective, European legal regulations in this area."
"I would like to see a proposal in the Commission's programme for a directive on combating violence against women."
"As for social objectives, the initiative to create a European Platform against Poverty before the end of this year is important."
"Unfortunately, there are no specific details of any kind about this."
"They have to be given at the meeting of the Council in June."
"On the matter of modernisation of the Union and the instruments of its operation, I would like to call attention to communication with the citizens."
"This must be a process, and not electioneering."
"There is a communication gap between the EU and its citizens, which we must strive to reduce, and, in the future, to eliminate."
"We must give EU citizens the feeling that they are 'at the heart' of the Union's activities."
"Only then will the results of referendums not be a surprise."
"The debate on the Commission's programme is particularly important because it coincides with the beginning of a new era in the European Union."
"The need to adopt measures at this time of crisis that can address the challenges in the long term makes it imperative to prioritise job creation, regulation of the financial markets and stabilisation of the euro, which should restore the confidence of the public, as well as of the economic and social players."
"I would like to stress the importance of the cohesion policy in the implementation of the various European policies."
"Europe's regions will only be able to achieve sustainable, integrated growth through a cohesion policy that has visible results and which respects the principle of subsidiarity, and through governance at various levels: national, regional and local."
"The objective of economic, social and territorial cohesion must guide the Union's actions and must be achieved through adequate Community financing, with greater transparency, simplicity and efficiency in the use of the Structural Funds."
"It is vital to define the guidelines for cohesion policy and the financial perspective for the post-2013 period."
"I would like to draw attention to the situation in the outermost regions, which, because of their permanent structural characteristics, face obstacles that have a serious effect on their economic development and therefore require special measures."
"The EU's primary concern is to combat the economic crisis and support its social market economy."
"The EU unemployment rate hit 10% at the start of the year, with the rate of youth unemployment even reaching 20%."
"The increase in the employment rate is closely linked to the EU's industrial policy."
"What legislative initiatives is the Commission considering regarding the European Union's future industrial policy and for generating new jobs?"
"The European Council, which met on 25 and 26 March 2010, set for the first time as one of the EU's targets a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020."
"We did not find this target in the Commission's programme of work, even though initiatives are required in this area which can be targeted at both European households and businesses."
"Furthermore, the Community budget for the transport infrastructure is almost non-existent for the 2010-2013 period, even though the challenges and development needs are enormous: ensuring intermodality between different forms of transport, the development of high-speed railway lines to serve not only all the Member States' capitals but other large European cities as well, the development of rail freight corridors and the single European sky, along with the modernisation of ports and the development of maritime transport."
"When will the Commission table a proposal concerning the necessary funding for the development of the trans-European transport infrastructure?"
"Coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Haiti (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on coordination of humanitarian aid and reconstruction in Haiti."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to express to all the honourable Members in this Chamber great appreciation for the attention this Parliament continues to pay to Haiti."
"Before passing the floor to Andris Piebalgs, who will inform you about the reconstruction and development of Haiti, let me outline the four main humanitarian challenges for the months to come and how the European Commission is addressing them."
"The first is the continuation of humanitarian assistance and, in particular, shelter, sanitation and health services."
"The relocation of the 1.3 million homeless in Port-au-Prince in temporary housing is a very complex undertaking because of practical issues such as land ownership, rubble removal, urban planning and security."
"Today, the priority concern are some 10 000 to 30 000 people living in makeshift camps in flood-prone areas."
"With the approach of the hurricane season, they have to be urgently relocated."
"This is a priority in our programme, as is strengthening camp management skills."
"We are paying very close attention to the pre-positioning of relief stocks."
"Most of them were completely depleted after the earthquake."
"We are now replenishing them and building the capacity of the Haitian civil protection service, which has actually become stronger as a result of the crisis, so that they can make use of them."
"Secondly, we have adopted a 'follow the needs' approach and are providing assistance where people are, in order to prevent further mass movements."
"We have made sure that our help reaches the whole of the country and not just Port-au-Prince."
"In this way, we have contributed to reducing the pressures in the capital."
"Following the same logic, we are also applying a 'whole-of-island' approach, whether it relates to the issue of Haitian refugees or to the logistics of the delivery of aid, or pre-positioning of relief stocks for the hurricane season."
"The Dominican Republic matters also and is not forgotten in our recovery programme."
"Thirdly, we are making sure that donor coordination results in building on each other's comparative advantage."
"With many actors in Haiti, this is no trivial challenge, but we have consistently been a very strong voice for UN-led humanitarian coordination."
"When I was in Haiti, my impression was that we have actually done quite well - in terms both of the civil protection teams from individual countries and in our own work."
"Fourthly, we must ensure the transition from humanitarian relief to recovery and reconstruction."
"We are working very closely with Andris Piebalgs to facilitate this transition whenever possible."
"I will give you two specific examples."
"Firstly, in the food sector, we are encouraging local purchasing of food."
"We are asking our partners - even if it is a bit more expensive - to reach out to local farmers to create demand and help them to recover."
"That, of course, leads to work on reconstruction."
"Secondly, we are also supporting cash-for-work programmes so, again, we can build a transition from relief to recovery."
"Last but not least, we are very focused on results."
"Europe is number one in terms of volume of aid and it has to be number one in terms of results."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, at the New York International donors' conference, the European Union pledged EUR 1.235 billion."
"We are the largest donor to Haiti's reconstruction so, in this way, we will also be the largest contributor to the government of Haiti's action plan for reconstruction."
"I am also proud about the manner in which we did it because it was an EU common pledge, which consisted of support from many EU countries, like Spain, France and the wider Community."
"But I am also proud that even my country, which has not had too many relations with Haiti, pledged additional funding, not just the funding channelled through the Community budget."
"The New York conference took place in a very good spirit."
"There was a very strong financial outcome, there was very clear ownership of Haiti's Government and there were many stakeholders."
"Some Members of the European Parliament could see that NGOs, including European NGOs, had a voice there."
"EU businesses have also been involved and also interim mechanisms for coordination, proposed under the leadership of Prime Minister Bellerive and Bill Clinton."
"As all the stakeholders are included in this mechanism, it gives a guarantee that money will not be wasted or used for other purposes."
"It is very important now that we concentrate our aid as quickly as possible."
"The Commission and Member States are already preparing a new country strategy paper and a national indicative programme for Haiti."
"To support our joint efforts, we will speed up our efforts to set up an EU House in Haiti, which would give greater visibility but will also help involve non-resident donors."
"I shall be going to Haiti this week to deliver first-hand concrete support to long-term reconstruction in the areas of infrastructure and governance."
"This week, I will sign five financial agreements for a total amount of more than EUR 200 million and I will also inaugurate some of the work we have already done like the rehabilitation of the road between Port-au-Prince and Cape Haitian, which is fully in line with the plan of action of the government and which also supports the 'whole-of-the-island' approach."
"To reinforce the government capacities, I will also inaugurate the reconstruction of the Ministry of the Interior, financed with EU contributions."
"I will also inaugurate a school in Mirabelais."
"Our particular focus is on education, as President PrÃ©val has requested, and we will also announce more budget support delivery."
"Delivering budget support is not blind support."
"We have taken many precautionary measures and undertaken many visits, so I can guarantee that your money will be used for its purpose."
"I will also commit to regulatory monitors for the construction process through regular visits and to speed up aid delivery."
"I will keep the European Parliament constantly informed of the progress made on Haiti reconstruction."
"I would also like to emphasise that it is not only me but the whole college: Kristalina Georgieva, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and also some of my other colleagues who will help oversee the reconstruction, such as Michel Barnier, who will go to Haiti in a couple of months."
"It is the ownership not only of the responsible commissioner, but of the whole College."
"We also need to discuss with the authorities a couple of issues on how to better deliver our assistance."
"Long-term commitment from the international community will not prevail if Haiti quickly slips back to a 'business as usual' approach."
"To prevent this scenario, we must strive to be effective and we have already mentioned some of the ways in which we can achieve this."
"But equally, there is great responsibility resting with the authorities and the people of Haiti to build in a better way."
"Two aspects stand out, in particular."
"On the social front, the government should be encouraged to enter into very close contact with the opposition and also with the whole civil society."
"That will build genuine national consensus around the development plan and promote the stability necessary for its implementation."
"On the economic side, the macro-economic framework presented in New York must be more rigorous and combined with a clear path towards employment and growth, which will break the cycle of poverty and inequality."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank both Commissioners."
"There are three points I want to raise."
"The first is the method and measures to be used for measuring the reconstruction needs of Haiti."
"The second is to ensure that the commitments we are making will be met, and the third is to talk about property rights and the vulnerability of people living, for example, in shacks built on property they do not own."
"First of all, in relation to the reconstruction works, let me say that I recently conducted the launch for the World Bank of a document explaining, in a very well-designed handbook, exactly how reconstruction should take place."
"Are we going to use this handbook, or are we going to use similar measures, to ensure that the reconstruction effort in Haiti is professionally carried out?"
"The World Bank has done excellent work on this."
"The Haitian Ambassador attended when I launched that particular book."
"Secondly, in relation to commitments we are making, I am very glad to hear what the Commissioner had to say about the EUR 200 million which he is forwarding almost immediately."
"But will we be back here in a year, or in five years, or are we are last going to deliver on donor commitments to a poor country that simply cannot be left on its knees any longer?"
"The third point I want to make is this."
"The extent of the destruction in Haiti was such that we really have to look not just at the damage done, but at why that damage was so extensive."
"People who did not own property were living in ravines and on the sides of mountains, in shacks and in any thing they could put together, because they did not own the property in which they were living."
"If people have property rights, they will invest in building and constructing properties that have some chance of resisting future damage of this kind."
"So I ask that this point be given active consideration as part of the approach to dealing with this problem."
"Again, I thank both Commissioners for their presentation."
"The situation in Haiti is far from being stabilised, as both commissioners, Mrs Georgieva, who was in Haiti at the end of March, and Mr Piebalgs have emphasised."
"The same statement is also made by the humanitarian workers who are in situ distributing aid and helping with the reconstruction process."
"Although the situation in the capital seems to be returning to normal, at least in terms of people's everyday lives, I believe that efforts now need to be focused on rural areas, which are continuing to experience major problems."
"These matters are all the more urgent and even more of a cause of concern as the rainy season is approaching and the state of the transport infrastructures may result in the interruption of the flow of aid intended to meet the population's daily needs."
"The reconstruction efforts are only just getting under way, as you told us."
"It is obvious that other problems are going to continue to crop up as well, linked to infrastructures, providing decent living conditions for the population and ensuring that a minimum level of public services, education and health care is operating."
"Problems will also crop up associated with having the necessary workforce and the extent of their training."
"Another major problem is dealing with children who have been orphaned or separated temporarily from their families, and who are in one of the most vulnerable and dangerous situations for their future."
"I believe that we must focus greater attention on this aspect of the humanitarian crisis in Haiti because of the ongoing problems involving the trafficking of children and illegal adoptions."
"Last but not least, I would like to say that I am pleased that the task of managing Haiti's problems remains a priority for the Commission."
"I can assure you that the same thing also applies to all the members of the Committee on Development."
"Mr President, the approach of the hurricane season in Haiti means that it is vital to maintain the humanitarian efforts and that other emergency measures are likely to be required."
"First things first, it is important to provide for sufficiently robust shelters, in sufficient quantities."
"This measure is relevant given, first, that rebuilding the destroyed homes takes time and, second, that Haiti's direct exposure to hurricanes makes one fear the worst, as the recent experience has shown."
"Seeking to pull out of the humanitarian effort now would be quite simply irresponsible."
"Delaying the reconstruction effort would be equally irresponsible."
"In other words, everything must coincide: the humanitarian effort, so that there are no more needless deaths; the reconstruction effort, to restore as quickly as possible something resembling a normal life; the recovery of the economy, which is essential in order to generate resources in the long term; the strengthening of Haiti's budget capacity in the very short term; and the firm commitment to decentralisation."
"The donors' conference, which was held at the United Nations on 31 March, was a success."
"What will remain of that conference when everything has been forgotten?"
"Humanitarian interventions aside, let us first remember the need for a swift revival of the economy, something for which the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund is hoping and praying, since he is counting on an 8% annual growth capacity over the next five years."
"Second, in a similar vein, the revival of the agricultural sector becomes the economic priority."
"Today, Haiti needs 80% of its export earnings to pay for its imported agricultural produce."
"Let us remember that, in the past, there were times when Haiti met its own food needs."
"Third, Haiti's development will have to be assessed on the basis of criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability."
"Fourth, if development is to continue over time, it is absolutely essential for the people of Haiti to take responsibility for it themselves."
"Fifth, the earthquake in Haiti once again demonstrates - if proof were needed - the importance of implementing without delay a rapid humanitarian aid system aimed at pooling both the material and the human capabilities of all the Member States of the European Union."
"What is stopping the proposals in Mr Barnier's report from being turned into a reality?"
"Lastly, Europe's significant efforts to help solve the Haitian problem will have been decisive."
"My thanks to the High Representative, to Commissioners Piebalgs and Georgieva, and to their Directorates-General, who deserve our gratitude."
"(PL) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my political group, and also on behalf of our group's coordinator, Mr Deva."
"I would like to stress the extremely important fact that international aid to Haiti at the moment is actually almost three times higher than the Haitian Government and the UN had hoped."
"This aid is to total EUR 11.5 billion, and it is worth underlining that the Haitian Government had been hoping for a sum of just under EUR 4 billion over the next two years."
"An absolutely fundamental matter is to concentrate on building infrastructure, which, by the way, my colleague Mr Deva emphasised during the last debate."
"I would also like to stress an important matter - supervision of this aid."
"The government in Haiti is very weak, and distribution of aid is largely in the hands of a diversified and very strange elite, and it is very important that international organisations and the European Union know to whom the money is really going."
"Mr President, Commissioners, we must ensure that the promises of donations made at the donors' conference henceforth materialise as actual funds, and also actually reach their intended recipients."
"Of course, I do not believe that this is enough to rebuild Haiti in a lasting way, even though we owe the people of Haiti so much."
"The people of Europe themselves have been very generous when it comes to showing solidarity but, unfortunately, there is a great risk of people forgetting or being made to forget the tragedy that our Haitian brothers are suffering."
"Yet, as you said, there is a sense of urgency: urgency, because other cyclones may occur and would make people's living conditions even worse; urgency, in terms of rebuilding houses and buildings, such as schools and hospitals, at a time when the Haitian Government is beginning to evacuate certain camps; urgency, in terms of coordinating and distributing food aid and care more effectively; and urgency, too, in terms of developing a new sustainable agricultural and rural project to ensure Haiti's food security."
"All aid, and the coordination of international aid, must be aimed at ensuring that the people of Haiti have access to fundamental rights."
"For example, why not stipulate that all public reconstruction contracts should be dependent on these rights and should contain clauses on employment, housing, education and health?"
"One cannot coordinate aid and reconstruction properly without relying on the population itself and on its trade union organisations, non-governmental organisations and farmers' organisations."
"We should encourage the creation of a new project for Haiti aimed at eradicating exclusion, poverty, dependence, and economic and political domination."
"Let us never forget that the terrible destitution of the Haitians is not due solely to a terrible earthquake."
"It is also the result of the domination and pillaging of Haiti by many countries."
"We owe the country a duty of effective solidarity at the same time as respect for its economic and political sovereignty: the economic and political sovereignty of the people of Haiti."
"Mr President, shortly after the disaster, an assessment was carried out in order to establish aid priorities."
"However, I hear from a reliable source, namely a Dutch NGO, that very little, if any, local expertise was drawn upon."
"To me, that seems to be the first prerequisite if we are to gain the support of the local population."
"It is therefore imperative that Haitian organisations and authorities are involved in the reconstruction effort."
"European NGOs could be of particular service here, thanks to their good local contacts, and I was pleased to hear from both members of the Commission that they are also thinking along these lines."
"In other words, we need to mobilise support in Haiti itself."
"Another point that I would like to make is that, while the provision of food aid by the US and other countries might seem like a welcome initiative, it has decimated Haiti's agriculture and food security."
"This situation has resulted in Haiti becoming more than 50% dependent on food imports and in there being no demand for 35% of the local harvest."
"We need to make a significant investment in local agriculture if we are to guarantee food security."
"Here, too, from the positions of both members of the Commission, I infer that the Commission is thinking along similar lines and that makes me very optimistic."
"Only today I read a whole-page article in Frankfurter Allgemeine about the current situation in Haiti."
"It was truly heartbreaking."
"I understand that housing and education are the priorities of the European Commission."
"Keep working towards that goal."
"I wish you every success and, above all, God's help."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you also to the Commissioners for the common sense they have shown."
"A great deal has certainly already been done, but I think I can say, also, that we cannot leave it at that: a very long-term programme - almost a permanent programme, I would say - is more necessary than ever given the apocalyptic conditions in which the country finds itself."
"The critical period is probably still not over."
"Just as on the first day, people are dying of hunger, thirst and poverty, and more than a million people on the island are still homeless and will shortly have to cope with the rainy and hurricane season."
"What should be done, then?"
"As the Commissioner has already said, coordination should be increased between the institutions and it should be linked to a more productive relationship with non-governmental organisations, especially those which, by operating on the ground, can get the best out of Haiti's citizens, can empower them."
"We must all be aware that being the point of reference for Haiti and its people in a way means making them understand that we want to see the value and the dignity of every single person restored and, for them, this means seeing their hopes of happiness restored amid the huge suffering caused by the earthquake."
"(ES) Mr President, commissioners, I would first like to express my condolences and thanks to the families and colleagues of the four Spanish soldiers who died last week in Haiti."
"They were specialist officers from the Spanish army, but they went there as simple soldiers as part of the international aid effort and were doing aid work when their helicopter crashed."
"Their example shows that in the majority of cases, there is no contradiction between security and humanitarian action."
"Moreover, without security, it is difficult to maintain independence and neutrality in humanitarian work."
"This is an acknowledgement we have to give to the armed forces of many European countries, including Spain."
"Mr President, commissioners, Haiti has demonstrated that poverty severely aggravates the damage done by natural disasters, and also that a lack of governability hinders the possibility of an effective response."
"Normally, poverty and a lack of governability go hand in hand, and this was and is the case in Haiti, which means that, as well as supporting the reconstruction process, we need to support governability in Haiti, because it is the only way that we will be able to achieve the objective that we set ourselves in New York: that Haiti itself should lead its reconstruction and that its civil society should participate in this."
"(FR) Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate the two Commissioners responsible for these matters on their speeches and on their constant concern to be extremely responsive."
"The earthquake in Haiti has resulted in a surge of solidarity and fraternity on an exceptional and very justified scale."
"I also applaud the courage and the efforts of the Haitian people, of the Haitian authorities, of civil society, of NGOs, of the Haitian diaspora and, of course, of the donors throughout the world."
"The structural and institutional weaknesses in Haiti are well known, and this disaster has obviously revealed the tragic extent of those weaknesses."
"In New York, on 31 March, the donors made it clear that their financial aid would contribute to the Haitian reconstruction and development plan."
"The principle of appropriation is thus established so that the people of Haiti can once again have confidence in their institutions, which is an urgent requirement."
"The donors' assistance must clearly be well coordinated and of a high quality."
"As President PrÃ©val says, reconstruction must be carried out more effectively."
"This must be done, it seems, by creating, among other things, an interim commission for the reconstruction of Haiti and by establishing a multi-donor trust fund to oversee the donors' generous contributions."
"More effective reconstruction also means stronger governance and institutions based on the rule of law, and decentralisation, which are key elements of the redevelopment and reconstruction plan."
"I hope, Commissioners, that you will, of course, take account of this approach, and needless to say, I am sure that you will."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioners, at this very moment, hundreds of thousands of people are still living in emergency camps and, with the rainy season and the hurricane season approaching, the situation really is urgent."
"Faced with the countless humanitarian actors on the ground and in the absence of state capacity, every possible resource must be employed to improve the coordination of aid under the auspices of the United Nations, and to deliver aid consistently and effectively."
"I travelled to New York for the international donors' conference on 31 March, and I welcome the European Union's contribution of EUR 1.3 billion towards Haiti's reconstruction over the next three years."
"For the first time, the European Union spoke with one voice through Baroness Ashton."
"True, a substantial aid package has been pledged by the international community, but the difficulties now relate to the proper use of these funds and to decisions in relation to the methods of implementing the aid and the bodies involved, given that the main actors in this reconstruction process must be the people of Haiti."
"The agricultural sector has to be a priority, and we must strengthen the country's agricultural production capacities."
"The European Parliament will monitor the reconstruction process and the use of these funds very closely, and I would point out how important it is to consider, at last, the creation of the civil protection force, for which we have been waiting so long."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioners, the humanitarian crisis in Haiti highlighted and, unfortunately, continues to highlight the problems with the European mechanisms for responding to international humanitarian crises."
"We need to create fixed funding mechanisms."
"In essence, we still do not have fixed headings in the European budget for financial assistance to third countries and the aid for Haiti was mainly given by European countries at bilateral level."
"Aid needs to arrive immediately and, in the case of the people hit by the earthquake in Haiti, the aid had still not arrived a week later."
"European resources need to be used efficiently."
"We need to have specialist staff who can design and implement humanitarian aid programmes quickly and efficiently."
"Obviously, an earthquake caused the disaster in Haiti."
"However, similar humanitarian crises may well be caused by other weather phenomena, such as typhoons, tropical storms, floods and droughts, phenomena which will increase considerably in frequency and intensity in the wake of climate change."
"We all know that climate change is a phenomenon which we, the developed countries, have caused; unfortunately, however, it is often the poor countries that feel the impact."
"We have a climate debt towards vulnerable countries and we must learn from our mistakes in dealing with the crisis in Haiti so that we can respond to our increasing global obligations in future."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioners Georgieva and Piebalgs, after the enormous tragedy in Haiti, we need to look to the future, as you have both noted."
"The donor conference in New York a fortnight ago raised EUR 7 billion or, at least, that was the amount which was pledged."
"On the basis of the Haitian Government's action plan, the EU has pledged EUR 1.6 billion."
"My question to you both now is: how will this now translate into lasting and stable reconstruction of the island?"
"This will be a long process, in my view."
"My second question to you both is: what is your assessment of the Haitian Government's action plan and can you ensure that the significant funds that have been pledged will be used effectively?"
"After all, the Haitians do not just have short-term needs, but long-term needs as well."
"How can we further intensify support efforts for the 1.3 billion homeless and ensure that the infrastructure can be rebuilt in the medium term?"
"This is important, not just for the population that has been affected, but also for the political stability of this island, whose government is incredibly fragile at the moment."
"You have confirmed that yourselves."
"It is the people's perception that the aid is not reaching the places where it is needed."
"How can we ensure that the political situation in this country and the approach of its government improve?"
"I would like to ask you how you see the input, in terms of both human beings and financial means, to this Interim Haiti Recovery Commission chaired by Bill Clinton?"
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Striffler for raising this matter at today's sitting, and Mrs Georgieva and Mr Piebalgs for their statements."
"I think many of the measures proposed in the resolution on Haiti which we adopted in February are a step in the right direction and can be the basis for rebuilding a country struck by disaster."
"These measures have two basic stages, and we are talking about these two stages today."
"The first phase is about short- and medium-term crisis relief to help people with the most urgent needs, and Mrs Georgieva spoke about this."
"The second phase concerns permanent reconstruction, which needs to be coordinated, and assessment of the needs of this reconstruction, while, at the same time, never losing sight of the fact that the owner of the process must be the people and the government of Haiti."
"Thank you very much, Mr Piebalgs, for seeing that responsibility must also be borne by the Haitians."
"The third stage is something only for us."
"I mean the conclusions which should be drawn so that our aid is better coordinated, and I am glad that the Commission is working on this."
"(FR) Mr President, Europe has contributed millions of euro, tents, food, soldiers and doctors."
"That is all well and good, but actually I would like to quote Jean-Yves Jason, mayor of Port-au-Prince, who, in February, used the word 'disaster', not to refer to the consequences of the earthquake, but to describe the complete and utter disorganisation of the humanitarian work that followed."
"We should be asking ourselves the following question: how can we prevent a repeat of this disorganisation, which has cost Haiti dear?"
"There is one answer to that question, Mr President, Commissioners, and it is one that we all know, that has been said here: by creating a European civil protection force."
"I shall ask you again: when will the Commission finally decide to propose to Parliament the creation, specifically, of a force of this kind, one single force having the same rules of engagement, and identical command, transport and communication systems?"
"It is possible."
"It can be set up quickly before the next disaster."
"I call on you now to stop talking about coordination and to act."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied with the outcome of the meeting of the donor countries because the large sums made available are an excellent result."
"Even more important, however, was the guiding principle behind the use of the funds, namely not just to build back, but to build back better."
"Haiti must emerge from this crisis stronger and with public buildings and private dwellings that are more advanced than the ones that existed before the earthquake wiped them out."
"We must not think that the reconstruction will spell the return of the shantytowns or of socio-economic conditions such as those that existed before."
"As such, money is certainly needed, but the substantial resources made available by the national and European institutions being only a first step, there is also a need for a long-term plan and for strong, authoritative coordination."
"To this end, having also criticised in this House certain initial delays whereby Europe, in the context of its foreign policy representation, displayed neither exceptional efficiency nor exceptional spontaneity, today, we welcome instead the excellent work that our institutions are doing in the area of coordination, and hope that, on the basis of this position and of this commitment, the efforts will continue with a long-term plan that can be brought to fruition through the authoritative presence of our institutions."
"(SK) The earthquake in Haiti was immediately followed by international humanitarian assistance."
"In addition to the American and Canadian military, I must also applaud the rapid and efficient deployment of groups from Slovakia and the international Military Order of Malta."
"Not many countries provided rapid and effective aid."
"Today, following the initial assessments of Professor MUDr."
"KrÄmÃ©r, an expert and a doctor who understands humanitarian assistance, it must be stated that many people and significant financial resources arrived from Europe but without the necessary equipment, machinery, food, water and fuel needed for effective intervention when rescuing victims from beneath fallen trees."
"Not even the experience of several rescue groups was sufficient."
"Good intentions also require a practical side in order to be effective."
"I therefore call on the competent national and European institutions to put in place as quickly as possible a joint humanitarian assistance service, as we requested in the resolution on Haiti."
"In addition to this, I consider it very important to support training in humanitarian assistance, and to have the necessary materials and equipment prepared in the eventuality of a natural disaster."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioners for their presentation and for all the effort they are putting into the Haiti case."
"I also agree that it will be good to focus on the whole island."
"Even if I am very critical about the whole of the Union approach, I might very well agree with your 'whole-of-the-island' approach."
"I also urge you not to forget the future commitments that we need to make."
"We need to stick to the pledges we are making now."
"If we see that the Member States are not so strict in keeping their 0.7% pledges, you really have to be strong on this and make sure they come forward with their plans."
"We also have to make sure that we do not make obsolete the progress that we are now making in Haiti by having other EU policies in place which will actually prevent progress from happening in Haiti and elsewhere."
"We really have to stick to policy coherence so that we do not have success in Haiti only to have all our progress ruined because of other harmful policies."
"(FI) Mr President, the EU has helped Haiti, which is a good thing, but this disaster has clearly shown, in my opinion, that the EU must have rapid reaction groups for humanitarian action, and that we must develop civilian crisis management."
"It is not enough to give money; the EU should also be able to take rapid action in this kind of catastrophic situation, to provide assistance and send people over there."
"People must receive concrete help, and not just after a long period of time."
"While this help is certainly important, the EU is currently lacking the capacity for local help and rapid help."
"I hope that people will focus their attention on this matter and that rapid action groups will be established."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, with your permission, I shall leave a bit of time for Mr Piebalgs to take on some of the long-term reconstruction questions."
"This has been very useful and very encouraging for us."
"Before I turn to the questions, let me join Mr Guerrero Salom in expressing sympathy to the families of the four Spanish soldiers who died, and also all those who lost their lives during the disaster and now in the recovery efforts in Haiti."
"I would like to start with the bigger policy issue, on the EU improving its response capabilities."
"I was very pleased to see my colleague, Commissioner Barnier, in the room because of the effort he has put into this topic."
"On 26 April, we will have a chance in the Development Committee to discuss in more detail the work programme, which includes, for 2010, strengthening the response capacity and a communication on this topic."
"I can assure you that this is a very high priority for our team."
"We will work very closely with Member States and with Parliament to come up with a solution that improves our capacity to respond to disasters, and there is a very simple logic behind it."
"At a time when the intensity and frequency of disasters are increasing and the budgets of our countries are going to be tight for years to come, there is no other way but to strengthen European coordination and to build an asset base that can be deployed effectively in terms of impact, cost and results."
"I can tell you that tomorrow, we are going to our first country visit on this topic."
"This is going to be a very high priority for our team in the coming months."
"Let me turn to four questions that have been posed."
"The first is on the question of combining a response to immediate priorities with long-term reconstruction and our staying power."
"This is really important because if we move too quickly to reconstruction, away from support for people in need, we risk a very serious tragedy."
"We had to deal with this in the issue of food delivery where the government of Haiti suggested that we shift away from food provision to only cash-for-work and food-for-work, which is highly desirable but cannot be done everywhere at the same time."
"This is something we are watching very closely."
"Broadly, on the issue of food security, our new policy in the European Union is very progressive because it emphasises all other things equally, encouraging local purchase of food for humanitarian aid whenever it is possible to get it locally."
"We have made this topic subject to a discussion in a morning session in New York where we invited NGOs, Haitian as well as international NGOs, and I was very proud that it was the European NGOs that put these issues of agricultural security for Haiti and high agricultural return in productivity for the discussion in Haiti."
"I want to address the issue of shelter."
"It is not at all a trivial issue because people actually do not want to move from where they are now."
"They do not want to move for a variety of reasons."
"One, even if their houses are safe, they are afraid to go back because of the trauma they experienced."
"Two, because they moved as whole neighbourhoods and they are scared of losing the social fabric that keeps them together, so it is not just bad policy or lack of desire; it is also the social phenomenon that follows a disaster of this nature that makes it not so easy to get people to move from flood-prone areas to safer ground."
"But we are addressing this as a priority."
"Let me finish with the question of long-term sustainability."
"It is governance sustainability, it is also ecological sustainability."
"I had the dubious privilege to fly over Haiti and Chile, within a couple of weeks of each other."
"In Haiti, an ecologically destroyed island, of course it had implications for the scale of this destruction."
"In Chile, the government has implemented for decades a reafforestation programme stabilising the soil and, as a result, creating a better environment, which is obviously very helpful for people."
"We are thinking in the long term when we think of Chile."
"This is not in my area but I have to pick it up as a former World Bank employee."
"I certainly agree with you that what the World Bank is proposing about this coordination in the multi-donor trust fund, but also as an institutional project management approach, is something that we need to take to heart and follow."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as usual, if I had just one wish in my political life, it would be to have more time in Parliament to answer the questions I am asked."
"I will not be able to answer all the questions put today, but I will go through some of them."
"The support of Parliament is very important for the Commission, because Haiti is not a case to which only the Commission is devoting attention."
"It felt that the whole of European society wished that the European Community make reconstruction a major effort."
"It is like a textbook: an assessment was made at international level, the governments made plans, these were discussed with NGOs, there were various endorsements and there is an interim commission coordinating the whole process."
"We are definitely not creating anything parallel."
"We are working on the same bases and on well-prepared ground."
"Regarding the commitment on the EU side, we have made a political commitment and we will deliver."
"I believe that the same is also very true for other participants."
"We are working on property rights."
"That is one of the risk elements."
"We have a land cadastre and we will work on it, but there could be risks."
"The risks could definitely come from ownership of the political process."
"The reconstruction effort can be sustained if there is a political process supporting the long-term development of Haiti and if people believe in it."
"This is where the big challenge comes, and all we can do is to support the Haitian people and Haiti's political society in this."
"I believe that this can be put in place and could be successful."
"Regarding the transparency of the process, the whole international donor structure has been established in a very clear and streamlined way with a lot of transparency."
"All the EU processes are definitely transparent and will give a full assurance that money will be spent not only for the purpose, but also well and efficiently."
"Lastly, I believe that we should not underestimate the people working on the ground - from the Member States, the Community, and also the broader international community."
"I would also like to express my condolences to the families of those people who have died helping Haiti reconstruct."
"There are many more people still working and trying to do their best."
"They are the guarantee that, if the process is well organised, it will be successful."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 13.10 and resumed at 15.05)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is now time for us to carry out an interim review of the aid effort in Haiti."
"The main questions that we need to ask ourselves are as follows: How quickly and effectively was and is the aid being provided?"
"Does the aid support sustainable development in Haiti?"
"How was the entire aid effort coordinated?"
"How was the EU represented in foreign policy terms?"
"I am particularly interested in the last two questions, because the devastating earthquake was the first test faced by the High Representative Baroness Ashton."
"The purpose of the office of High Representative is to strengthen the EU's role as a global player."
"However, Baroness Ashton did not think it was worth travelling to Haiti shortly after the earthquake to provide symbolic support, nor was she able to ensure that the aid provided to Haiti was coordinated effectively."
"Some Member States launched individual aid campaigns and others acted jointly."
"Baroness Ashton should have been responsible for ensuring better coordination."
"In addition, the government of Haiti has not been sufficiently involved."
"The High Representative should now at last be realising what her job is all about."
"She should be making constructive proposals for structuring humanitarian and financial aid following major disasters."
"There is a great deal of development work to be done over the next few months and this also applies to Baroness Ashton."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered here today to discuss European coordination of aid for Haiti."
"Meanwhile, international commentators are criticising our uncoordinated action."
"Three months have already passed since the tragic earthquake, and it would appear we are still unable to work out a common position on support for Haiti."
"In January, we listened to many speeches about the role of the Union in the international scene, but it is a disgrace to see how weakly and indecisively the Union has acted up till now."
"The allocation by the European Union of EUR 1.2 billion for aid to Haiti is worthy of praise."
"World donors have declared that they will give USD 5.3 billion for the reconstruction of Haiti over two years."
"In the longer term, the value of their aid is to rise to USD 9.9 billion."
"These are very optimistic sums."
"The cataclysm in Haiti has, however, made me stop and think about a country which, actually, collapsed a long time ago."
"The earthquake was a natural disaster, but the present extent of poverty in Haiti is the result of economic, political and social collapse."
"The collapse and violence in Haiti in recent years are the result of brutal relations with the outside world - with certain states and international concerns - which go back for hundreds of years."
"International society has let Haiti down."
"Let us do more to make up for this now."
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission."
"Questions on any subject on behalf of political groups."
"Then the second part of the sitting - questions on the employment situation in the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, the Centre for European Studies, the problems suffered by Greece, the Europe 2020 strategy and the search for answers to the financial and economic crisis all clearly indicate to us that in taking the necessary measures, we will soon reach the limits of what is possible under the existing treaties."
"On the other hand, many Member States are taking refuge in a new form of intergovernmentalism, nationalism and protectionism, instead of looking towards Europe."
"What do you plan to do to overcome these problems, to establish the necessary common objectives and to create credible European instruments, so that we are able to act effectively and provide the right answers?"
"President of the Commission. - It is true that, quite surprisingly, some national politicians are making an intergovernmental reading of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Lisbon Treaty was agreed precisely to increase the European dimension; to reinforce the powers of the European Parliament; to make it easier to take decisions by qualified majority voting; and to reinforce the role of the Commission in economic surveillance and external affairs."
"This reading is therefore quite surprising, but it is indeed happening."
"The role of the Commission is, of course, to be the guardian of the treaties, in accordance with Article 117 of the Lisbon Treaty, to protect European law and to be firm about the respect of European law, because the day the European Union is no longer a Community of law, it will no longer be a real Union."
"Secondly, its role is to promote initiatives and to take the lead in initiatives."
"To that end, it will do its job in trying to come forward with proposals which I hope will have the backing of this Parliament."
"In my political guidelines, I mentioned the special relationship with Parliament, and I really intend to make that a reality."
"Mr Rehn proposed a package in Madrid which has not yet been adopted, but which involved a discussion of sanctions right at the beginning of the debate."
"In my opinion, we should not start our discussions with sanctions on the Member States, because that would be putting the cart before the horse."
"Instead we should establish the common objectives, common projects and common instruments that we need in addition to what is already in place and only then should we consider sanctions for behaviour that shows a lack of solidarity."
"What is your view on this approach?"
"President of the Commission. - As you said, Mr Karas, there is no decision yet."
"There was a first debate with the Finance Ministers and, in fact, the Commission will present a communication next month on reinforced economic governance."
"We aim to reinforce the preventive and corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We will make proposals for a more effective and broader surveillance of intra-euro area macro-economic imbalances and we will explore the options for the creation of a crisis resolution mechanism, but we will concentrate on substance."
"We believe it is possible, with the current treaties, to do much more in terms of surveillance of the euro area and of the economic and monetary union if there is indeed a willingness on the part of the Member States to cooperate and respect the treaties."
"Article 125 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is the so-called no bail out clause, in other words, the ban on Member States of the EU taking on the debts of other Member States."
"What is your view of the fact that the aid package put together for Greece will now result in countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, lending money to the Greek state for three years at an interest rate of 5% while borrowing it themselves on a three-year commitment at 1.5%?"
"Given an estimated total of EUR 8.4 billion, that makes a profit of EUR 620 million."
"Does the no bail out clause not also include the requirement that, if one Member State cannot take over the debts of another Member State, it also cannot earn any money from the debts of another Member State?"
"Are you prepared to discuss with the German Government or with other governments what seems to me to be a completely unacceptable mechanism?"
"President of the Commission. - It is true, Mr Schulz, that the Lisbon Treaty does not allow the so-called 'bail out' of Member States."
"The solution found so far - which has not yet been activated because it has not yet been requested - is, according to the Commission, fully in line with the treaty."
"I want to underline this."
"I know a debate is going on in some circles in Germany - and indeed in some other Member States, but in particular in Germany - and I want to say that it is simply wrong that what we have been contemplating is some kind of bail out."
"It is not."
"It is a coordination of loans."
"The Commission will have this responsibility."
"The IMF will also be in the scheme which, I have to say, is a creative one."
"It is a solution that was possible only after extensive discussions with our Member States, but it is fully in line with the treaties and, of course, it respects the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Let me conclude on a political note to say that I find it quite extraordinary that it was so difficult to find a solution of solidarity for Greece when one could be found for Latvia, Hungary and Romania."
"If we can find those solutions of solidarity and responsibility outside the euro area, I think it is quite obvious that we should also find them in the euro area."
"Mr Barroso, I understand that you are attempting to avoid answering my question, because it is an unpleasant one."
"Therefore, I will repeat it."
"There is at least a possibility that Member States which can borrow money on better terms than those on which they are lending it will be able to profit from the debts of another country."
"As the no bail out clause states that Member States cannot take on the debts of others, they should not be allowed to profit from those debts either."
"Are you prepared to say openly to Mrs Merkel or Mr Sarkozy, for example, or to anyone else that you are opposed to this course of action?"
"President of the Commission. - I have been speaking about this matter with those leaders and others for many weeks, so I can tell you very frankly, Mr Schulz, that unfortunately, the only solution possible was this one."
"The Commission had asked from the beginning for a more concrete signal of solidarity with Greece, of course, always respecting the principle of responsibility."
"But what we have to do now is to ensure that Greece can be encouraged to return to market financing as soon as possible and, in fact, the solution found was one where the euro area Member States' loans will be granted at non-concessional interest rates."
"The pricing for loans by the IMF was considered an appropriate benchmark for setting euro area Member States' bilateral loan conditions, albeit with some adjustments which were agreed on 11 April."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, first of all, as far as the no bail out clause is concerned, the treaty does not say that."
"The treaty says that a Member State cannot be forced to take on debts."
"The treaty does not say that it is forbidden to take on debts."
"This must be made clear, or else it just becomes a cacophony about the treaty."
"I repeat: the treaty clearly states that a Member State cannot be forced to take on debts."
"Therefore, everything concocted with regard to Greece involves things that are possible under the treaty and that can be enforced."
"My question is slightly different."
"Interest rates on Greek loans have risen again to 7.6%, in other words 450 base points above the German rate."
"Other measures are therefore needed, and I am thinking about very significant fundamental reforms: a European Monetary Fund, a European bond market, a more ambitious 2020 strategy."
"Commission President, my question is this: at what point are you considering placing a package with reforms of this kind, including the reforms that Mr Rehn has already embarked on, on the Council's table?"
"For this is what is needed now, to present an ambitious package of reforms alongside the specific measure for Greece."
"Firstly, Mr Verhofstadt, and also in response to Mr Schulz, let us be absolutely clear and honest with ourselves: if there are questions that you want to ask Mrs Merkel, you must ask them."
"I am not here to reply on behalf of Mrs Merkel."
"I am here to reply on behalf of the Commission."
"Let us be clear about that."
"Let us also be clear from the point of view of the Commission."
"The solution that has been found scrupulously respects what is known as the no bail out clause."
"Naturally, we have been very cautious on that point. As far as the measures that we are going to take are concerned, the communication and the proposals on which we are going to work will be presented next month."
"I want to talk about the communication regarding strengthened governance of the euro area."
"A policy debate has already taken place and Mr Rehn has received a mandate from the Commission with a view to an initial discussion with the finance ministers."
"I can therefore tell you that, some time in May, you will know the thrust of the measures we shall be presenting for the future to help strengthen governance in the euro area, and in the European Union generally."
"Mr President, may I ask the Commission President whether the European Monetary Fund idea will form part of this proposal?"
"Mr President, to give a concrete answer on that point, I can tell you that our position tends to go against the idea of creating a new institution within the context of economic and monetary union."
"From my own perspective at least, I am not sure that this is a good idea, but I can tell you - personally speaking, since the College has not yet decided - that the idea of a facility for ensuring financial stability in the euro area seems a good one to me."
"I might add that we are in the process of exploring different ways of providing for and strengthening insurance mechanisms such as those responding to the concerns that gave rise to the European Monetary Fund idea."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, I would have liked a Commission President who simply says to ask Germany to lend at the rate at which it has to borrow, which is 3%."
"You could at least say so publicly."
"That would form part of the debate in Germany, but you are incapable of saying these simple things."
"I would like to ask another question about ACTA."
"You have been negotiating the ACTA Agreement against piracy and counterfeiting since 2008."
"In March, a European Parliament resolution told you to scale down the ACTA negotiations on counterfeiting."
"Tomorrow, you are going to publish for us - thank you, we have been waiting a year for it - the assessment of the debates and a text adopted at the end of the New Zealand Summit."
"You know that Parliament will have to say 'yes' or 'no' at the end of these negotiations."
"Would it not make more sense to have Parliament participate more visibly, thereby ensuring some transparency with regard to the negotiations?"
"Otherwise, you are going to find yourself in the same situation with Parliament as you experienced with SWIFT."
"I would therefore ask you from now on to demonstrate greater transparency and to let us have the texts of the negotiations, just as you let large companies have them."
"Parliament is every bit as important as a large company."
"Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit, there is no doubt about that, and I have the greatest respect for Parliament."
"I might add that is why the Commission, and more specifically, Mr De Gucht, obtained permission, from our partners in these negotiations, to make public all the texts from the negotiations."
"As you know, they are going to be made public tomorrow, 21 April."
"You are no doubt also aware that these negotiations began before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and we also wish to involve Parliament closely in these negotiations."
"New powers exist for Parliament in the area of international negotiations, and the Commission is in favour of Parliament playing a greater role in such negotiations."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, let us avoid playing with words: whether or not you asked for it, unless you make transparency public, you cannot continue with the negotiations, given that you have the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The issue is therefore not that you asked your partners to publish the reports for Parliament; you have to do so, because otherwise, Parliament will never say 'yes' to you, because you are now bound by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, therefore, you are now obliged to be transparent with Parliament, because in the end, you have to have a 'yes' from Parliament, and that is not a certainty, given the state of the negotiations and of the text with which we are dealing."
"You spoke about the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am very much in favour of the European Parliament's role being strengthened in this area as well, and the text to be made public tomorrow, for which we had to obtain permission from our negotiating partners, is the text of the negotiations, the draft negotiation text."
"We shall do it."
"You are no doubt aware that some international negotiations are more sensitive and require a cautious approach for certain areas, but we want as far as possible to involve Parliament, to which the Treaty of Lisbon has rightly granted powers in the area of international negotiations."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - In March, the European Commission announced it would conduct another review of the Working Time Directive, after the previous review fell."
"It was Parliament's insistence on scrapping the national opt-outs from the directive which led to the stalemate."
"As we will all recall, UK Labour MEPs in the pockets of their trade unions voted to scrap the UK's opt-out, despite instructions to the contrary from their own government."
"Now that we have a further review and considering that many EU countries want their workers to have the choice to work more flexible hours, can President Barroso confirm that this Commission will propose a directive that respects national opt-outs from the 48-hour working week?"
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I do not yet have a draft legislative proposal in my pocket."
"It is too early, at this stage, to have fixed ideas about the substance of any changes."
"As you know, there is a consultation paper that is deliberately open in tone."
"I also want to hear the social partners' views."
"The new rules should protect workers from the health and safety risks of excessively long working hours and insufficient rest."
"They should also be flexible enough to allow for the conciliation of work and family life and to promote the competitiveness of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I think we have to have a solution for that, Mr Kirkhope, quite frankly because, as you know, there are cases before the Court of Justice that oblige us to find a solution."
"So we will try to find a broad-based support for a new proposal and avoid the long discussions that marked the last attempt to revise the directive."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - I understand that President Barroso does not want to prejudge the outcome of the Commission's consultation."
"However, there are a number of people in the EU - not least the three million people in the UK who currently take advantage of the opt-out - who will be looking for a commitment from him that, during an economic downturn, his Commission does not want to make it harder for people to work."
"I am afraid that Commissioner Andor did not give us that assurance at the time of his confirmation hearing, but I trust that President Barroso will now."
"President of the Commission. - You are very kind, Mr Kirkhope, but apart from Britain, there are, in fact, also 26 other Member States in the European Union, so you will understand that while we are very receptive to the concerns you have expressed, I also have to listen to other legitimate concerns."
"This is a very difficult issue and an extremely sensitive one."
"We have to find the right balance between the flexibility you are highlighting for small and medium-sized companies and the protection of workers which I am sure you are also in favour of."
"That is what we are going to do."
"That is why we are appealing to the social partners also to come forward with a constructive proposal."
"Mr Barroso, you have spoken about your work programme and it has been discussed in Parliament."
"You have said that you want to follow up on the critical remarks."
"I have one question."
"Recently, we have spoken a great deal about the crisis and how to overcome it."
"However, I have the impression that very little has changed in the way the banks do business."
"I would also be interested to hear the answer to another question."
"Do you think that we and the Commission have done enough?"
"If not, what do you believe it is still necessary to do in order to combat the causes of the financial crisis in the longer term, so that the banks cannot go on doing business in the way they currently are?"
"President of the Commission. - Just today, in the work programme, we have presented our action in the financial sector."
"We have done a big part of it, but another important part remains to be done."
"I think the Commission proposals were the right ones."
"In fact, I regret that, in some cases, the level of ambition has been reduced by Member States, for instance, regarding the supervisory framework that is now being considered by you in Parliament, and we will come forward with some proposals - there is a complete list that I have presented today to Parliament - in the near future."
"But I think there are some specific things, to be more concrete, that we can do."
"For instance, I am supporting the idea of a bank levy."
"I think that should be a matter for the G20."
"I think it is fair that the banking industry, after all the problems it has created to the overall economic situation, also gives a contribution for the future of our economies."
"So, as always, it is a question of balance."
"We do not want to undermine what is a very important sector in our economies - the financial sector - but we believe that some more measures are important to restore confidence in the financial sector."
"Mr Barroso, I have another brief question."
"The chair of Deutsche Bank, Dr Ackermann, is a difficult man to make an impression on."
"He has recently said outright that he wants to make returns of 25%."
"Do you not think that this flies in the face of the measures taken by the Commission and the individual governments?"
"He is not changing anything."
"He has said that he wants to make returns of 25% once again."
"This is what Dr Ackermann, the chair of Deutsche Bank, which is an extremely important bank, is saying."
"President of the Commission. - I am sorry, I did not follow the statements by the Chairman of Deutsche Bank, and I cannot comment on something I am not aware of."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Because the financial crisis was a credit crisis and a banking crisis that took place and emanated from the large commercial banks - the Royal Bank of Scotland, IKB, Fortis and the like - do you accept that the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, as well as being highly damaging to the UK, is a misdirected and misguided regulatory initiative on the part of the Commission that aims entirely at the wrong target?"
"President of the Commission. - Absolutely not."
"I think it is a very good initiative that aims precisely to restore some confidence in what is a very important sector of our financial markets."
"I think it is in the interests of the financial sector to have credibility."
"Let us be honest and open about it."
"There is now a problem of credibility in the financial sector and it had its origin in, let us say, irresponsible behaviour of some major players in that sector, not only in Britain, as you said, but in other countries in Europe, apart from the situation that originated in the United States."
"We need a proper level of regulation."
"We believe that the regulation we have put forward is the appropriate balance and it does not aim at creating difficulties for the financial sector."
"On the contrary: it aims at building trust."
"The financial sector needs this kind of credibility to finance the economy."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - How will the AIFM Directive, aimed at alternative investment fund managers, restore confidence in the financial sector when the problem is with the big commercial banks?"
"That is my question."
"President of the Commission. - I am sorry but I do not agree the problem is only with the big banks."
"In fact, the problem created in the United States was not created by big banks only."
"It was also created by non-commercial banks, by investment societies, by hedge funds as well."
"So we do not agree with that analysis that it was created by big banks."
"In fact, some of the big traditional commercial banks were not responsible for the crisis."
"There were many kinds of players that have some kind of responsibility for the mess, let us state it very clearly, that was created in the financial sector."
"We believe that an appropriate level of regulation is the best way to address the issue both for banks and for other kinds of instruments or operators in the market."
"Mr President, the European External Action Service will be responsible to the High Representative."
"The role of the High Representative, according to Article 18, is to conduct the European Union's common foreign and security policy, as mandated by the Council."
"The Council, for all its faults, at least contains representatives of Member States."
"However, influential voices among the political groups in this Parliament are arguing for the Commission to play a much more decisive part in the service."
"In particular, it is argued that the Commission should provide at least 50% of the staff of the External Action Service and that the service should not be subject to influence from intergovernmentalism."
"I apologise for that word."
"It is not mine but I see it as a code for the Council and the European Council."
"Furthermore, of course, the High Representative is an ex officio Vice-President of the Commission."
"All this seems to point to the likelihood that, in reality, the EU's foreign policy will be run by the Commission and the idea that it is run by the High Representative, with a mandate from the Council, would be legal fiction."
"Would you agree?"
"President of the Commission. - I do not agree."
"We are not there."
"In fact, as you know, the creation of the institutional position of High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission is one of the most important innovations of the Lisbon Treaty and the idea is to put together what typically we call intergovernmental competences and Community competences."
"For the common foreign and security policy, it will remain basically intergovernmental: it is the prerogative of the Member States."
"But there are other Community competences that should not go now to the intergovernmental arm."
"It should be kept, of course, in the Community method."
"So the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission is, as we say, usually double-hatted."
"She will have to put together, using the best of the synergies, those two competences."
"So there will be, of course, competences that she will be able to develop inside the Commission, as Vice-President of the Commission, but working also hand-in-hand with the Member States and with the Council."
"I think that is the contribution to have more coherent and consistent external relations of the European Union, to reinforce the defence of our interests and promote our values in the world."
"I can see the internal consistency of what you are saying as a Euro-integrationalist, which I am not."
"But, in fact, what you are suggesting is that we should actually go beyond the Lisbon Treaty, which is bad enough, and almost cut out the Council which, as I say, for all its faults, at least contains representatives of nation states."
"President of the Commission. - I could never suggest that the Commission go against the treaties, because it is its duty to ensure that the treaties are respected."
"What I am really asking Member States to do is to respect the treaty, and all the institutions have to respect the treaty."
"The treaty strikes a balance and that balance has to be respected."
"It represents progress compared to the past, where we had completely different institutions to deal with what is, in fact, a very important common interest - namely the defence of European values in the world."
"I consider it possible, in full respect of the treaty, to achieve exactly what the treaty aims to achieve."
"That can be done in a spirit of good cooperation between all institutions and in full respect, of course, of our Member States."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I come from the south of Italy and in our region, the economy is based on small and medium-sized enterprises, on the textile, clothing and footwear manufacturing industries, and on agriculture."
"Today, this type of industry is in serious difficulty because of the influx of goods from China and the Asian markets."
"To produce a shoe in our region, in southern Italy, costs EUR 13."
"The cost of the finished product from China is EUR 5.50."
"A baby grow produced by us costs EUR 4-5, whereas one from China costs EUR 1."
"Entrepreneurs are relocating in order to survive or are closing down, and when they close down, thousands of jobs are lost, and this also causes a consumption crisis and an impoverishment of the region."
"Whenever I meet entrepreneurs, they ask me: 'What is stopping you from imposing customs duties, from imposing taxes?'"
"For in China, there is low-cost production because children from the age of 12 work 10 hours a day with no social security benefits, no insurance and no health care rights."
"I know that protectionist measures are undesirable, but what is the answer?"
"Mr Barroso, when I meet entrepreneurs, what do I tell them that Europe is doing to combat an irreversible crisis in which so many businesses are failing, so many jobs are going up in smoke and entire regions of Europe, including the poorest regions, the south of Italy, are going through a serious and irreversible crisis?"
"I would like to be able to offer some answers, Mr Barroso, and I would like to hear them from you."
"President of the Commission. - I understand your concern and it is a very legitimate concern, and I would like to say a word about the small and medium-sized companies, which in fact are, as you know, the most important driver for job creation in Europe."
"Now, how can you respond to this problem of competition coming from other parts of the world which have lower standards, both in labour and in environment?"
"I think the solution is certainly not to close our borders, because the European Union is by far the biggest exporter in the world."
"So the solution is to promote decent work and upgrading of social standards all over the world."
"That is a matter which we have been pushing inside the G20; that is a matter that we have been pushing with the International Labour Organisation, and that is a part of our dialogue with other partners."
"But I really think it is not a solution - unless there is dumping - to act via anti-dumping instruments, nor is it a solution to close our borders to other very important trade partners of Europe."
"That will be self-defeating for us."
"(EL) Mr President, to pick up on the references made earlier to the handling of the Greek problem, all of us who are closely following developments in and the handling of these problems realise, and many of us have the feeling, that the Council has elbowed the Commission aside."
"The Commission was, from the beginning I think, a balancing factor for the medium-sized and smaller Member States of the Union towards the Council."
"Today, I think that its role in the issues faced by Greece, but not just Greece, is confined to action and statements of a technocratic nature."
"My specific question is this: we are talking about the economy, about monetary union with more acute supranational elements."
"We are also talking about the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy being prepared by the Commission and we are talking about combating unemployment and poverty."
"How, when the Commission does not have the role that befits it, will it be possible to implement these ambitious strategies?"
"President of the Commission. - The issue of employment, as you know, is dependent on the overall economic situation."
"Let us be completely clear about it."
"We cannot restore the levels of employment that we had before the crisis before we come back to more growth in Europe."
"That is why we are concentrating our efforts on the new sources of growth and, in fact, trying to restore this growth that is critically important for the European Union."
"That is our priority now."
"That said, there were some measures that were taken specifically for employment."
"We have some proposals in our EU 2020 strategy for new skills, for new jobs, for programmes for youth, but the basic thing is to restore the conditions for growth, including confidence in our economy."
"When it comes to the Greek situation, as you know, a lot has to do with the confidence also in the future of the Greek economy."
"That is why it is so much dependent on the correction of some fiscal imbalances."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, the employment situation in Europe is very worrying, as my fellow Members have just pointed out."
"In 2009, 2.7 million people in the euro area lost their jobs."
"Furthermore, the poverty risk rate for the population with a job has risen to 8% of workers in Europe, not to mention the fact that nearly 17% of the population live below the poverty threshold."
"Faced with this situation, do you not think that a two-pronged strategy ought to be implemented?"
"On the one hand, by reinforcing decent work - it would have been worth including this issue, rather than employment strictly for growth's sake, in the 2020 strategy; moreover, are you counting on promoting the creation of green, intelligent jobs to develop a sustainable, united society? - and, on the other, by increasing the overall employment rate in Europe, with particular emphasis on jobs for young people - you talked about this - but also for the over-fifties."
"In this regard, the increase in requests made to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the restructuring in various sectors highlight the need to develop a global industrial policy."
"All the issues you have raised are dealt with in the 2020 strategy, Mr Daerden."
"I already talked about decent work in my political guidelines, just as I talked about the existence of a genuine industrial policy for Europe - not the old industrial policy, but a policy aimed at providing Europe with sustainable industry, a more modern, sustainability-focused policy."
"As far as young people are concerned, at least two of the flagship initiatives are devoted to them, that is to say, the 'Youth on the move' and the 'New skills for new jobs' initiatives."
"We have highlighted a number of objectives, for example, in relation to education, the fight against poverty and the campaign for social inclusion."
"This aspect appears in the 2020 strategy, precisely because we consider that the fight against unemployment is now the main priority."
"I believe that the development of this strategy will enable us to achieve significant results in the fight against unemployment."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, over the last few years, unemployment has increased throughout all the countries of Europe - albeit in different forms from one country to the next - and is destined to increase further."
"Economists all agree that it will take at least two years for the tentative signs of recovery that are evident here and there to become the norm and that, in any case, for at least 10 years, the recovery will be so limited that it will not create any additional employment."
"This means that we will have a rise in unemployment, with job losses among those who are today in employment, and, at the same time, we will have generations of young people who are not and will not be able to enter the labour market."
"I ask you whether you do not think it is necessary, faced with such a situation, to promote a measure aimed at guaranteeing a standard income in Europe for all those who lose their jobs, and to regard the issue of young people as a kind of emergency and, hence, to come up with a specific training-related measure that will benefit them, for the entire time in which they remain outside the labour market."
"President of the Commission. - You are basically right in your analysis regarding the situation in the labour market."
"In fact, the situation is continuing to deteriorate, even if it is at a more moderate pace than in the past."
"We are also starting to see more consistent signs of stabilisation in some Member States."
"But it has been nine months since the economy started to recover from deep recession and it may take some time this year before the fragile pick-up in economic activity has an impact on reversing the trend in the labour market."
"That is why our priority is now employment."
"For young people, unemployment is particularly worrying, as you said."
"We have more than 20% of young people unemployed in Europe."
"That is why we have launched three initiatives for this year."
"Two of them I have already mentioned."
"There is also the Youth Employment Initiative."
"Among the specific initiatives that we are going to develop is precisely the step-up of vocational training through more apprenticeship schemes, financed by the European Social Fund and also fostering high-quality learning experience in the workplace after graduation, the so-called traineeships, including the possibility of traineeships in other Member States."
"Last week, the European Climate Foundation launched its 'Roadmap 2050'."
"This plan shows three pathways by which the European Union could cut its CO2 emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, in line with our Kyoto aspirations."
"We could do it at little more than the cost of business as usual."
"We could become almost entirely self-sufficient in energy resources and we would see a significant net job creation through the decarbonisation of our economy."
"But it can only be done at European level."
"Will the Commission embrace this roadmap?"
"Will it endeavour to give the European Union a new Ã©lan in proposing the necessary policy measures?"
"Given the opportunities for job creation, will you, President Barroso, use the idea to galvanise the Member States into the necessary action?"
"President of the Commission. - I am aware of that report of the European Climate Foundation and, indeed, under the 2020 strategy, we have proposed a resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative whose aim is precisely to decouple growth from resources, giving Europe a competitive advantage compared to other international partners."
"This objective was also fully translated in the Commission's working programme for 2010 and beyond."
"It is the Commission's intention to develop a path for Europe's transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and climate-change resilient economy by 2050, particularly through the decarbonisation of the energy and transport sectors, thus providing a long-term framework for policy and investment."
"I underline the word investment."
"We believe that the climate agenda can also be, as the renewable energy sector is showing, a way of creating more jobs in Europe, what we usually call 'green jobs'."
"Several recent announcements of new IT tools, like Google Books or iPad, would facilitate access to cultural content in digital format, notably the so-called 'e-books'."
"However, most of these initiatives come from the US."
"What is the Commission doing to promote digitisation of our cultural heritage on the European continent?"
"President of the Commission. - The European Digital Library, addressing the challenge of putting online the collections of our national libraries, museums and their archives, this is a major task of our times digitising, making available, preserving the wealth of our culture."
"Yet we have to do it without jeopardising the rights of authors and publishers, including out-of-print works and for so-called 'orphan' works."
"We also have to assess whether our financial efforts and the public-private partnerships that are being experienced here and there are up to this very important societal challenge."
"In this perspective, I have asked Vice-President Kroes and Commissioner Vassiliou to set up a comitÃ© des sages."
"I am happy to announce today to you that Mr Maurice Lavie, Mrs Elizabeth Nigerman and Mr Jacques Decare will be entrusted with this task."
"As a comitÃ© des sages, they will promote this idea of keeping our very important heritage through digitisation, in full respect of course of the property rights."
"I look forward to receiving their recommendations on these important issues by the end of this year."
"(PL) Mr Barroso, I would like to know what, in your opinion, will be the effect on employment in the aviation sector of the airspace closures which have lasted for several days now?"
"Today, on the front page of the influential newspaper, the Financial Times, it says the closures, which have affected nearly 7 million passengers and have caused the cancellation of 80 000 flights, have brought losses to the aviation industry of USD 200 million a day."
"In your opinion, how will this affect employment in this sector? - because I understand this was the main reason for your absence, and the absence of Mr Van Rompuy, during the funeral of the President of Poland in Krakow."
"President of the Commission. - First of all, regarding the issue of the funeral, I want to keep it completely separate from the rest."
"I had a great respect for President KaczyÅski."
"I worked in a very loyal manner with him."
"I did everything to be present at his funeral."
"I was present at all the ceremonies that I could attend marking the deaths of President KaczyÅski, his wife and all those that were killed in that tragic accident."
"I really do not understand how it is possible to make this kind of criticism against the European institutions, by using the death of so many people."
"I was trying to go to the funeral of President KaczyÅski until the very last moment."
"The problem is that only on Saturday, very late in the evening, I received the information that the flight that was organised by the Belgian authorities was cancelled."
"It was no longer possible for me to go."
"So I want to make it absolutely clear that I have done everything I could to pay tribute, not only to the people who died in the tragic accident, but to Poland as a nation."
"Regarding the issue, if I may now use the other minute to answer the question on the aviation sector, we are aware of the very important impact on industry of this volcanic problem and that is why we are already doing our work to see how we can in fact help, if needed, the European aviation industry."
"They are suffering severe economic losses, which are caused by not being allowed to carry out their commercial activities for several days."
"It is necessary to look for a global solution to help the industry out of the crisis and, in fact, we have a precedent, which was the crisis after 11 September."
"So we are looking at possible ways in terms of alleviation of the State aid rules, as we have done in the past."
"We discussed this in the college meeting today."
"(EL) Mr President, Mr Barroso, according to official statistics, unemployment in the European Union fluctuated between 8 and 9% between 2000 and 2006, to the glory of the Lisbon Strategy, which talked of full employment."
"The Commission states in a recent report that unemployment will reach and go beyond 10% in 2010, a 'social volcano', to use the language of the moment."
"In addition, in a series of countries applying austerity programmes, such as Ireland and Greece, as well as in countries such as Romania, Hungary and Latvia, where the International Monetary Fund has become involved, unemployment has soared to record levels."
"In light of this, I ask you: has the Commission studied the repercussions of these austerity policies, which you push for and pressure countries into following in order to get out of the crisis?"
"Have you studied the repercussions on employment and on the economy of a country in which the International Monetary Fund is involved?"
"Do you believe that unemployment will fall in Europe as a result of these policies?"
"President of the Commission. - We are not forcing anyone to take any measures."
"Regarding Greece, decisions were taken by the Greek authorities, but you will certainly understand that this situation of macro-economic imbalances in the Greek economy is very negative for growth and also for employment."
"It is clear that without a restoration of confidence in Greece's public finances, there will be no investment or growth in Greece."
"Without growth, we cannot generate employment."
"That is why we should not set macro-economic stability and rigour in contradiction or opposition to growth."
"The problem is to see how we can manage a transition, how we can keep stimulus in the economies that have the margin to do it, and, at the same time, respect the necessary balances of macro-economic stability."
"That is why it is in the interests of the Greek economy and of Greek workers for Greece's public finances to have credibility as soon as possible."
"(DE) My question refers to the volcanic eruption which will, of course, have an impact on particulate matter and CO2 emissions."
"Do you believe that it is possible to evaluate what levels of particulate matter should be taken into account in future in order to prevent jobs being put at risk?"
"Our air quality directives provide for significant restrictions in this respect."
"President of the Commission. - This volcano problem is certainly beyond the control of the European institutions or the national governments."
"It happened and now we have to react to its consequences."
"Regarding the aviation industry, we have already said that we are looking at what we can do, also based on the precedent that was already there after 11 September."
"Regarding the economic situation, I think it is too soon to make an overall assessment of the damage caused, and it is probably better to avoid very dramatic - or let us say, panic - scenarios."
"What we believe is important now is to address the damage and to try to see what we can do at European level, bearing in mind one important thing - at European level we are responsible for one per cent of the public budget."
"The other 99% is in the hands of the Member States."
"So I think it is unfair to look to the European Union to try to solve all the problems, where we do not have the means to do so."
"(PL) Mr Barroso, in the 2020 strategy, you have presented very ambitious rates of increase of employment, from 63% to 76%, and a reduction in unemployment among early school leavers to 10%, but also an emphasis on education, which is the key to development, so that in the future, 40% of European citizens will have completed tertiary education."
"In relation to this, I would like to ask the following question: will the European Social Fund, as well as funds designated for research and development, be maintained in the future European Union budget?"
"For this is, in fact, the key to an emphasis on modern methods, innovation and increasing employment."
"Do you not think that we should also emphasise the development of micro-entities?"
"For this is the best way to encourage self-employment, and rates of self-employment are still too low today."
"Hence, in this context, these questions would appear to be justified."
"President of the Commission. - Yes, you know we have proposed education as one of the targets in the EU2020, including fighting against early school leaving and having more tertiary education."
"We believe it is impossible to discuss European competitiveness without addressing the issue of education."
"That is why we are trying to convince all Member States to accept that target and, certainly, afterwards there has to be a mobilisation of resources, some from Member States and some from the European Union."
"We have to discuss afterwards the Financial Perspective."
"We are not yet there but, certainly, I think some actions should also be taken at European level, complementing the efforts made by the national governments."
"Indeed, in the Social Fund, we already have some actions for young people for apprenticeships and for traineeships."
"This is our intention."
"We cannot anticipate what funds will be available for the Social Fund but, certainly, we believe that we should have adequate ambition at the European instruments' level."
"(DE) Yesterday, the media told us that the Opel plant in Antwerp will close."
"This is just one of many examples of jobs being lost in Europe."
"Next Thursday, the European industrial trade unions will be holding a day of demonstrations throughout Europe."
"They are calling for jobs and the future of Europe as an industrial base to be safeguarded."
"The trade union members want full employment, but they also want effective European policies and definitive answers today, not in five years' time."
"Your work programme does not provide very definitive information in this respect."
"You have just referred to the guidelines and the Europe 2020 position paper."
"In my view, this is not specific enough."
"You should provide examples."
"What do you plan to do to re-establish our strategically important industrial sectors in Europe and what role is the Commission playing in making the automotive industry future-proof and in safeguarding jobs?"
"President of the Commission. - The employment guidelines are very much dependent on the overall economic growth, but we intend to reinforce the employment aspect in our EU 2020 strategy."
"In fact, we have four guidelines: increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce, promoting job quality and lifelong learning, improving the performance of the education systems and increasing the participation in socio-education, as well as combating poverty and social exclusion."
"These are general guidelines that now have to be pursued by the European institutions with all the instruments they have at their disposal, and by national governments."
"It is true that there is no silver bullet, there is no magical solution or panacea for unemployment in Europe."
"It has to come also from the overall measures taken for growth in terms of respect for financial stability, in terms of confidence in our markets, in terms of tapping the potential of the internal market."
"That is the only way to do it."
"When it comes to the automobile industry, of course we know that there was over-capacity not only in Europe but in the world, and we are following this very closely with the industry itself, including with the trade unions in the sector."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, unemployment and exclusion among young people are a big problem."
"As you have said, 20% of young people are unemployed."
"The problem is also that while many people are now being laid off, a large proportion of those laid off are over 50."
"At the same time, however, people in some Member States are saying that we must lengthen the period of time spent working, that we must raise the retirement age, and people are also saying that we need more workers from overseas."
"This would therefore require a large amount of labour migration."
"In my opinion, there is something of a contradiction here."
"I would like to ask: if people want to lengthen the period of time spent working, then why are over-50s not being offered the opportunity to continue working; why are they instead being laid off?"
"Why are we not creating opportunities for our young people, but instead telling them that we need labour migration from overseas?"
"What is the European strategy on this issue?"
"Can we not bring about such a strategy?"
"I believe that we are all of the opinion that talented young people should be found work, and that they should not be excluded."
"Our society will always pay a big price for exclusion."
"President of the Commission. - I want to win this competitiveness battle globally."
"One thing is sure: we need more people, working more and longer - and I would add, better, in a more competitive way."
"There is no contradiction between having longer working lives and having some immigration to Europe."
"In fact, it is quite extraordinary, but today, there are almost one million job vacancies in Germany and almost half a million in the UK."
"This shows that there is a problem of mismatch between the supply and demand for labour."
"There is a lot to do in this area."
"I believe that pension reforms are also a way of contributing to that."
"I want to underline that, during this crisis, Member States did not resort to the traditional policy of having people leave the workforce earlier."
"They have not done so."
"In fact, it has been possible to keep people in work for longer."
"This is important because, for Europe to remain competitive, we need to raise the employment rate in Europe."
"(PL) Mr Barroso, you said in your speech, today, that a priority for the Commission in its employment policy is, among other things, to help graduates and young people be effective in entering the labour market."
"We know the unemployment rate in this social group is currently very high."
"In Spain, it is currently almost 40%, while in Poland it is 20% and is, unfortunately, rising all the time."
"I think one problem is that the subjects taught do not match the needs of the labour market, and also there is poor access to initial work experience."
"In your opinion, can we speak of the low effectiveness of the Leonardo da Vinci programme in the area of education and vocational training?"
"How do you assess the programme?"
"Is the European Commission preparing new measures and, if so, what are they, in order to tackle the rising unemployment among young people?"
"What can you offer and propose today, Mr Barroso, to the young people of Europe?"
"President of the Commission. - Youth unemployment is the most dramatic problem now in terms of unemployment in Europe because it is more than 20%."
"That is why we have announced three concrete initiatives: 'Youth on the move', 'Youth employment' and 'New skills for new jobs'."
"'Youth on the move' to improve efficiency and equity of European education and training systems; 'Youth employment' to look at ways to overcome the impact of the crisis on young people and 'New skills for new jobs' to better match skills and labour supply with demand."
"I have just highlighted the situation in two of the largest Member States in Europe because, by 2020, 16 million more jobs will require high qualifications and, for example, the European Social Fund will spend EUR 13.5 million, between 2007 and 2013, in promoting adaptability measures for workers and enterprises."
"So there are some measures that we can take at European level, Community level, to complement the action of our Member States regarding the problem of youth unemployment."
"(DE) Mr Barroso, I have to disagree with you."
"You said that Europe 2020 included measures to exploit the potential for the creation of green jobs in the European Union."
"That is not true."
"You have simply failed to include this in the strategy and I am wondering why."
"It is obvious that if you want to generate employment, the greening of the economy is a significant opportunity for job creation."
"Why does this not form part of Europe 2020?"
"What is the Commission planning to do to exploit the job creation potential of a sustainable economy in Europe to the full, in particular, given that the European Council President has included this as an important point in his concept, because he believes that it offers a major opportunity?"
"What is the Commission intending to do?"
"President of the Commission. - I have to remind you that it was the Commission that launched the climate change and energy package and that we have highlighted the great potential for the creation of jobs in some sectors of the so-called greening of the economy and that, certainly, the priority for the future is such, one of the most important targets of the EU 2020."
"We have put at the centre of the EU 2020 our climate and energy targets, from 20% reduction of greenhouse gases, to 20% renewables and to 20% gains in energy efficiency."
"For instance, to have this target of 20% renewables, we are going to create jobs throughout the renewables sector."
"So it is certainly the central piece of our economic strategy for the future and, in fact, we have put that as one of the core objectives."
"Growth, not only smart growth and equitable growth, but also sustainable growth."
"(FI) Mr President, a lot has been said here about young people, which is only right."
"There is another group of people that are being affected very severely by this employment crisis, and that is women."
"That is, at the moment, when national economies are going into debt and the Member States are cutting their budgets, these budget cuts are often aimed at areas such as health care and education in which women work."
"I would also ask, Mr Barroso, what will you say and what do you intend to do to those Member States which are cutting human resources, education and health care, despite the fact that the 2020 strategy says we must invest in these areas?"
"Given that, at the moment, the mood music in the Member States is 'cut, cut, cut', and not 'invest, invest, invest in people', what do you intend to do to these Member States?"
"President of the Commission. - For women, it had risen to 9.3% by February 2010, compared with 9.8% for men, so lower than for men."
"It is true though, as you said, that in the future, female employment may give cause for more concern, as some of the sectors which will be most affected by the upcoming fiscal tightening are precisely those more dependent on women's jobs."
"What we have to do is to ask Member States to reflect this in their policies and not to accept that women be disadvantaged in this transition."
"We believe that the target rate for employment - and we have also discussed this with the Member States in the European Council - should be aimed at promoting the employment both of men and of women."
"In fact, in some Member States, there is great potential for this."
"There are some Member States where the employment rate for women is still very much lower than for men."
"President Barroso, thank you for your answers and for being present during Question Hour here at the European Parliament."
"I think it was interesting."
"Thank you, colleagues, for being active during the last hour."
"We will also meet next month during Question Hour with President Barroso."
"The EU strategy for relations with Latin America (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America."
"Madam President, High Representative, I would like to say that the report, as adopted by the committee, on the one hand, acknowledges the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union - which I do not see in this Chamber, which surprises me given that we are talking about a Latin American matter - and, on the other hand, welcomes the Commission communication entitled 'The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership'."
"I think it is difficult to find two regions that have more in common in terms of values and interests than Europe and Latin America."
"The figures, Madam President, are very well known: together, they have more than a billion citizens, account for more than 25% of global gross domestic product and, along with the Caribbean countries, include almost one third of the countries that make up the United Nations."
"It is also well known, although the figures show a slight decline, that the European Union is the main donor of development aid, the main investor in the region and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, and the largest in Mercosur and Chile."
"However, more importantly than the figures, we consider Latin America to be more than a market for Europe, and we therefore share a whole series of principles and values, which are pluralist and representative democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression, the constitutional state, the rule of law, respect for due process and the rejection of all forms of dictatorship and authoritarian rule."
"This summit, Mrs Ashton, comes at a very remarkable time in the calendar for the European Union and Latin America."
"It is a remarkable time for the European Union, because having gone through the reform process, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are a little engrossed in overcoming and contemplating our own problems, with the economic and monetary crisis."
"We have seen that, for the first time, the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country, but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union."
"When we look at the European Union's growth rates for last year, we see that, on average, we had a negative growth of 5%, while Latin America had a negative growth of 1.8%."
"When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%."
"This means that the next summit is not going to be a North-South summit, like the previous summits, but a summit between equals."
"In that respect, I think that we should look back, if only briefly, and feel satisfied at what has been achieved in the last few years."
"It is clear, however, that a great deal still remains to be done."
"In that respect, Mrs Ashton, between 2000 and 2010, the European Union concluded association agreements with Mexico and Chile, but the United States concluded agreements with the whole of Central America, with Colombia and Peru, and also with various Mercosur countries."
"We therefore need to make up for lost time quickly, and in some way seek strategic partnerships with Mexico and Chile, apply the future developments clause in these agreements, and conclude the agreements with Central America, where we need to introduce greater measures of generosity."
"At the same time, Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility."
"This summit is not, however, just another summit, Mrs Ashton."
"At this one, a very clear issue is going to be at stake."
"If we continue to lose our share of trade with the region, which has declined from 25% to just over 15% because of countries such as China, we are going to become irrelevant."
"Therefore, in line with the Spanish Presidency, I ask you, as High Representative and a Vice-President of the Commission, to send out a clear and very definite message regarding the commitment of this new Europe that we are building towards our old friends in Latin America."
"Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Madam President, Honourable Members, I am pleased to be back at the European Parliament and I am looking forward very much to this debate on relations with Latin America."
"I would like to begin by thanking Mr Salafranca for his excellent report."
"I think it illustrates very well the convergence of views between our two institutions on the importance of - and, as he has rightly said, the prospects for - the European Union's partnership in this region."
"I welcome very much the commitment of Parliament to strengthen relations with Latin America, including through the interparliamentary dialogues."
"Our joint efforts are central to developing a consistent policy and a strong presence in the region."
"I agree that the upcoming summit is a good opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the region and our determination to deepen the partnership."
"As the report rightly points out, the partnership has been a success."
"Today, the EU is Latin America's second-largest trading partner and the biggest investor in the region."
"We are expanding our cooperation beyond economic issues to cover key strategic issues - climate change, non-proliferation, tackling drugs, the promotion of peace and security worldwide."
"With this in mind, the Commission last year set out its strategy for Latin America in the communication called 'The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership'."
"Our main conclusions were to step up the regional dialogue and support regional integration, to strengthen bilateral relationships - taking into account the diversity of the region - and to adapt cooperation programmes to make them focused and results-oriented."
"I am pleased we have taken a number of initiatives since then."
"We have worked very closely with Brazil and Mexico on Strategic Partnerships and with Chile on the Association for Development and Innovation."
"With Peru and Colombia, we have completed negotiations on a multi-party trade agreement and we expect to complete negotiations for an association agreement with Central America in the near future and are working to resume negotiations with Mercosur."
"We have intensified our policy dialogues on a range of issues - sustainable development, migration and the fight against illicit drugs."
"These are important negotiations and dialogues."
"They strengthen our relationship."
"There is also much that we can do in practice on regional integration."
"It is very important that the combined weight of the EU and Latin America is able to focus on priority areas."
"With regard to the summit, I agree very much that this is an important occasion."
"We want to have an action plan that covers cooperation on key issues - science, technology and innovation, environment, climate change and so on. Secondly, we want to acknowledge the progress that has been made with the various subregions and strengthen bilateral partnerships."
"Thirdly, as Mr Salafranca said, we want to launch the Investment Fund and to establish the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Foundation."
"We are working hard to strengthen those relationships between the European Union and Latin America in what is, of course, a fast-changing world and where we can maximise the potential that we have."
"I am very keen to hear views from Members of this House and to respond to any questions."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, against a backdrop of financial, social and environmental crisis, the European Union has a role to play, a role of cooperation for development, ahead of the Madrid Summit."
"As the official champion of human rights and development aid, it must take up its many challenges in Latin America."
"Let us remember that the EU is the biggest donor, having pledged nearly EUR 3 billion in 10 years."
"The Committee on Development is delighted by the Commission's pledge to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are respected, especially with regard to education."
"I am also delighted to find in the Committee on Foreign Affairs' report recognition of feminicide and the prioritising of the fight against climate change."
"All the same, I regret the absence of concrete measures and of a genuine development strategy."
"After Copenhagen, the Committee on Development had called on the EU to take notice of innovative projects in Latin America, such as those presented at the Cochabamba Summit this week or the Yasuni ITT project in Ecuador."
"Respect for the political, social, environmental and cultural rights of indigenous populations must be at the heart of our transatlantic relations."
"We have also emphasised observance of the ILO conventions that are flouted in Colombia."
"The minimum environmental and social standards must be respected."
"Finally, we regret the absence of any reference to public services, water and health in the Committee on Foreign Affairs' report."
"Personally, I do not believe in the proliferation of study organisations with a ridiculous budget that do not allow for genuine dialogue with civil society."
"I do not believe in the usefulness of creating more budget headings that cut into the development aid lines for the sake of unclear objectives."
"I do not believe in any agreement of which the priority might not be respect for human rights and the environment."
"The aim of the EU-Latin American partnership is not just to protect commercial profits."
"The free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia are a very poor counterexample."
"Our duty is to encourage regional integration and to oppose any signed agreement that would weaken such integration."
"It is our responsibility to defend, above all, human rights and respect for the environment in all our external relations."
"Madam President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that we must see Latin America as a hugely important trade partner."
"We believe that negotiations should be reopened for the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which affects 700 million people and will be the most ambitious bi-regional agreement in the world."
"We also believe that negotiations concerning the agreement between the European Union and Central America should be concluded before the Madrid Summit, which is to be held in May."
"We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile, which have been a real success."
"We must therefore express our satisfaction at the conclusion of the free trade agreement with Colombia, which is going to be very beneficial both to Europe and to the Latin American country."
"We believe that Parliament's job now is to ratify these agreements in due time and to ensure that no country in the Andean Community that wishes to conclude an agreement is excluded."
"We, of course, also believe that free trade agreements can and should also be a useful tool for promoting the development of citizens' rights and freedoms."
"Lastly, we believe that the path to follow in the future is, on the one hand, to develop the European Union's agreements with the various countries and regional groups and, on the other, to promote inter-regional integration agreements within Latin America itself."
"Madam President, Mrs Ashton, first of all, allow me to congratulate Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on the very successful outcome of his report."
"You are aware that the May summit is an excellent opportunity for driving forward relations between the two parties."
"The Spanish Presidency is to be congratulated on the work it has done in this regard."
"Nevertheless, I think that what is important is for the relationship to continue to be promoted and strengthened after that Presidency has ended."
"You have a great deal to do in this respect, Mrs Ashton, because there is no other region in the world that has a greater historical, cultural and institutional affinity with Europe than Latin America."
"There is all the more reason to promote the relationship if we consider that, due to the desire of the Latin American people themselves, but also due to Europe's consistent support of democratic institutions, those institutions have achieved a high level of consolidation."
"This report, to which I think I can say my group made a satisfactory contribution, is a good message to send to the May summit in Madrid, and I hope that it will contribute to the results of that summit, and help highlight the fact that it is essential to move forward in the strategic relationship between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean."
"We, of course, support the adoption of the Latin America Investment Facility and the creation of the Europe-Latin America and Caribbean Foundation with a view to the summit."
"In addition, although we are aware of the difficulties experienced in recent years, we hope that the Madrid Summit can give a definitive boost to the negotiations with Mercosur."
"We also welcome the significant step forward of concluding the negotiations on the multi-party agreement with Peru and Colombia, and we trust that, when the time comes, a good, intelligent formula can be shaped that will allow for the desired incorporation of Ecuador, and that we will also leave the doors open, always open, to Bolivia."
"Finally, how can we not celebrate the more than probable and welcome conclusion of the agreement with Central America, and the now accepted incorporation of Panama into that agreement and into those negotiations?"
"I will conclude, Madam President, by saying that of course, all of this must be considered within the framework of what the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament considers to be the basic socio-political philosophy in this area."
"That means supporting the various integration processes in Latin America, demanding respect for human rights and taking an inclusive, development approach, while always committing to keeping dialogue channels open despite any difficulties that might arise and to deepening our links with our strategic partners in order to achieve progress on these objectives."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (BG) Madam President, Mrs Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I first of all wish to express my delight at the huge contribution made by Mr Salafranca to the development of relations between the European Union and Latin America and at the exceptional role he has played in compiling this report."
"The strategic partnership between the European Union and Latin America for the period up to 2015 will develop against the backdrop of 'Agenda 2020', the global agreement drafted to combat climate change and promote our aspirations for creating a green, environmentally friendly economy."
"This is why I want to stress that Latin America is a strategic partner with which Europe must extend its economic and cultural influence even further."
"Particularly during the current global financial crisis, this partnership can be of paramount importance and open up greater opportunities for commercial, scientific and technological exchanges, enabling us to emerge from this crisis in stronger, more stable positions."
"Madam President, I would like to speak in Spanish, at least for the first part of my speech."
"I would also like to acknowledge the process that has taken place in the negotiations since Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra's report was first tabled and what we have achieved now."
"I think it has been a good process, as you have accepted several of our positions, although I must say that obviously, if the report were written by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it would be different, but that is the way things go in Parliament."
"You said, Mr Salafranca, that you wanted to see the relationship between the European Union and Latin America as a relationship between equals, and I must say that I like this idea, but the problem is establishing who these equals are: are they the governments, which are also different, or are they the people, who are asking for more information, or for more rights - as in the case of women - or for poverty to be tackled?"
"That is something that needs to be defined, and which I think is still somewhat missing from this report."
"I do, however, admit that we have succeeded in some aspects."
"I am also happy that the Verts/ALE Group has succeeded in including the cultural rights of indigenous peoples, a proposal that came from the Committee on Development."
"The issue of feminicides, a very serious aspect of violence against women, has also been included, as has the ruling of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights."
"I think that these are major steps forward."
"There is also climate change, which does affect the populations on both continents equally, for example, with what is happening with the glaciers."
"On one aspect, there is a difference between what the Verts/ALE Group wanted and what other groups wanted, which is that we are not in favour of continuing with the association agreements as we have done so far."
"We would prefer to have an agreement with the whole of the Andean Community, a broad agreement, and not only an agreement with Colombia and Peru."
"I would like to end with a specific question to Mrs Ashton:"
"I will continue in English."
"This is a concrete question to you, High Representative, and one that unfortunately we were not able to include in the report."
"Will you speak out against mega-projects like the dam at Del Monte on the River Shingu in Brazil, which is being planned at the moment, and which will destroy swathes of living space for the indigenous peoples and is also not the best solution in terms of energy consumption?"
"There is a protest under way in Brazil, in which hundreds of civil society organisations are participating."
"There are also legal proceedings under way in Brazil."
"I would like to know from you what the Commission, and what you as High Representative, are doing in order to preserve the environment in the Amazon area for the peoples living there, and for all of us on this planet."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, High Representative, I congratulate Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on an excellent report on the EU's strategic relationship and partnership with Latin America."
"After the 2004 enlargement to central and eastern European countries, the EU has understandably refocused the CFSP towards the east, i.e. Russia, Central Asia and China, but nevertheless, trade between Latin America and the EU continues to grow rapidly."
"So this largely democratic region with whom we have much in common must not be forgotten."
"Later this year, Brazil will mark another stage in its emergence as a world economic and political giant when the country holds a presidential election and President da Silva steps down after his maximum two terms."
"Brazil, along with Mexico, is now designated as an EU strategic partner."
"Colombia is also a promising example of how democracy can truly flourish in Latin America and it is now negotiating an FTA with the EU."
"It, too, will hold a presidential election and its people will undoubtedly miss the visionary leadership of Ãlvaro Uribe."
"In contrast, Venezuela is led by a populist demagogue, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, who has shown scant regard for democracy and freedom of expression."
"Bolivia and Ecuador have also shown worrying signs of following the disreputable example of ChÃ¡vez and Castro's Cuba."
"Finally, it is deeply regrettable that President Kirchner in Argentina has chosen to divert attention away from domestic politics and her poor performance as president by employing bellicose language over the Falkland Islands, whose inhabitants wish to remain British."
"With regard to Mr Salafranca's valuable report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, I would like to request that the Council and the Commission, who are both now represented in the person of Baroness Ashton, take urgent action on three issues."
"My first point is that we need to demand the full cooperation of the Latin American countries, in particular, of Brazil, as rotating members of the Security Council, in all international attempts to bring the conflict with Iran over nuclear arms to a peaceful resolution."
"So, we need genuine cooperation and support in that."
"My second point is that we need to demand the full cooperation of the Latin American countries in the continued fight against Islamic terrorist networks."
"This applies, in particular, to Venezuela, because Hezbollah is not exactly just sitting there minding its own business, and neither is Iran."
"My third point is that we need to demand the full cooperation of the Latin American countries in the fight against the global evil of anti-Semitism."
"Again, one person causing great concern in this respect is President ChÃ¡vez of Venezuela, but unfortunately, he is not the only one."
"Recently, the Stephen Roth Institute published a report which highlights several somewhat unpleasant aspects of this issue."
"Finally, last week, the European press maintained a voluble silence as regards China's growing influence in Latin America."
"Does this mean the European Union will, on occasions, be caught in the middle between these two strategic partners of Brussels?"
"(FR) Madam President, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra's report contains many interesting things."
"It is very comprehensive."
"Europe cannot turn away from relations with a unit which, as Recital J of the report recalls, consists of 600 million people, accounts for 10% of world GDP and to which we are connected by special historical ties, especially with regard to the Latin countries of Spain, Portugal and Italy, many of whose citizens went to live in Argentina, and even France, which still has a presence in Guyana."
"However, I regret that the report does not tackle two essential issues more directly."
"Firstly, there is the issue of globalisation, free trade imposed across the world, and the international division of labour, which is wrongly presented as a panacea and which poses extremely serious economic and social problems, not only in Europe, but also in Latin America."
"Secondly, the other problem is that of independence from Big Brother, in other words, the US big brother."
"We are not its enemy but even so, we must remember, after all, that the Monroe doctrine, the professed aim of which at the time was to prevent any recolonisation of Latin America by Europe, was turned into a de facto protectorate, the effects of which we saw a few years ago, above all, in terms of the brutality of the intervention in Panama."
"Therefore, I agree that we should deal with issues such as drug production, but it is not our job to dictate the law, reason, justice or equality between men and women to the peoples of Latin America."
"We believe that we should devote ourselves to those issues that are strictly essential."
"(ES) I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra on his excellent work on this report."
"(RO) The European Parliament is currently sending out a clear message about strengthening relations between the European Union and Latin America, all the more so as the EU-Latin America Summit is going to take place in one month."
"At the same time, these relations between the EU and Latin America are one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency."
"However, I believe that there is a great deal of untapped potential for boosting trade between both regions."
"This is why the European Union must provide resources for promoting European products on the Latin American market."
"In this regard, some Romanian products already have a market outlet in Latin America."
"Our national car, the Dacia, is one example I can give of this."
"Romania has a long tradition of good cooperation with Latin America, as our Latin heritage is a valuable asset we have in common."
"I would like to emphasise that I welcome the new tri-partite approach mentioned by the rapporteur, involving the participation of the European Union, Latin America and the US."
"At the same time, we must take into account cooperation projects which will consolidate the IMF's legal status and equal access to education and the workforce."
"Finally, Mr Salafranca's report and the Madrid Summit must lay the foundations for the long-term development of the strategic partnership between the EU and Latin America."
"(ES) Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra."
"I think that this is a very important report."
"I would like to say, ladies and gentlemen, that there are millions of reasons why we should consider Latin America to be a very important continent for Europe: there are millions of Europeans living in Latin America, and there are millions of Latin Americans who have come to our countries, to Europe, and have found refuge and asylum in France, Germany, Sweden and Spain from the suffering of their people."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Latin America is very important for the European Union, which is why I am very pleased that in the next few months, perhaps largely as a result of the work done by Mrs Ashton and also the Spanish Presidency, it might be possible to conclude four major and very important agreements, with Colombia, Peru, Mercosur and Central America."
"This is going to be extremely important for the European Union and, above all, for Latin America."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, we need to help Latin America."
"Its countries have weak state machinery, with public services that are still very weak because they have very low tax ratios, they have democracies that are still very flawed, and there are problems with human rights."
"We need to help the Latin American people."
"We always need to keep this vision in mind."
"I would like to give you two messages, Mrs Ashton, or two recommendations, which I think are very important."
"In order to work in Latin America, we also need to have the support of European enterprises."
"Our external policy needs to be conducted with a very strong economic presence of our major companies in Latin America, which can do a great deal for the development of those countries with a culture of social responsibility and with a commitment to their development."
"Finally, we need to form a global alliance with Latin America in order to work together in the world, on world governance."
"Let us join together with them so that we can be stronger."
"(DE) Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Salafranca, as a member of the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, I am very pleased about your report, because it is really important for us to continue to strengthen the relationship between the European Union and Latin America."
"We have made a great deal of progress since 1999."
"Latin America has a population of 600 million and almost 600 million people also live here in the European Union."
"We have similar values and human rights and we are also linked by the desire for democracy and peace."
"However, the actual conditions in the two continents are very different."
"In a partnership, it is important to ensure wherever possible that both partners are equally powerful and that is not yet the case."
"There are many problems in Latin America, including illiteracy, but also a lack of infrastructure, a general lack of education, democratic deficits and violations of human rights."
"Fortunately, we do not have as many problems."
"Many people there make a living from the drugs trade and this, of course, is something that must change."
"As a major trading partner with an active involvement in development aid, it is our job to ensure that Latin America receives further help with its democratisation processes."
"I would like to see the partnership leading to people in Latin America living in peace in the same way that we do in the European Union and allowing them to also learn and benefit from one another as we do."
"This is why I very much like the idea of a Euro-Latin American Charter for Peace and Security and a Europe-Latin America Foundation."
"I believe that this would deepen the partnership even further and really help us to make more progress."
"(CS) My fellow Member, Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra, mentioned at the outset here that Europe and Latin America share very similar values."
"There is nevertheless one exception."
"In March, we discussed here the situation in Cuba."
"When negotiating EU strategy concerning relations with Latin America, Cuba, as a significant player in this region, must not be overlooked."
"Cuba's Stalinist regime, with its totalitarian ways, is attempting to damage relations between the EU and this region as a whole."
"However, the region does not deserve this."
"Latin America is a significant partner for the EU, even without the Cuban regime."
"The EU's partner on the Cuban side should not be the current Castro regime, but the movers of change and the democratic opposition."
"I have the greatest respect for all the opponents of Cuba's communist dictatorship, and I would like to thank Cardinal Jaime Ortega for the brave words he delivered - yesterday, I believe - to the regime."
"I am of the opinion that democracy, the observance of human rights and freedoms, freedom of expression, the rule of law, the legal state and the rejection of any form of dictatorship or authoritarianism not only form the foundation of the bi-regional strategic partnership, but are also an essential prerequisite for it."
"Madam President, at the beginning of the debate, Baroness Ashton kindly said that she would respond to any question."
"Baroness, I would urge you please to answer my following question."
"Proposals documented by the Committee on Foreign Affairs include negotiations for the establishment of a Euro-Latin American Charter for Peace and Security, based upon the UN Charter."
"Whose interest do you support in relation to Argentina formally asking the United Nations Secretary, Ban Ki-moon, to question British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands?"
"The Argentine Foreign Minister, Jorge Taiana, has asked the UN to help stop further unilateral acts by the UK in relation to oil drilling in the area."
"A recent summit of Latin American and Caribbean leaders saw unanimous support from all 32 countries for Argentine claims to the Falkland Islands."
"Do you agree that, underpinned by the principle of self-determination in the UN Charter, Britain should maintain sovereignty of the islands, and will you be supporting her interests in accordance with international law?"
"I would like an answer please."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a biregional strategic partnership has been in place between the European Union and Latin America since 1999."
"The basic principles of this partnership include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, together with the right to education."
"However, it is a fact that these principles are often violated."
"In addition, around 42 million people in Latin America are illiterate."
"The European Union is both the main investor in Latin America and an important trading partner."
"Finally, I would like to say that the fact that women are socially disadvantaged and that discrimination against the indigenous peoples continues, to highlight just two of the problem areas, is in violation of universal human rights."
"There is still work to be done in this area and improvements still need to be made."
"(EL) Madam President, I wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his highly integrated and substantiated report."
"I also agree with the Vice-President of the European Commission and High Representative on the importance which she attaches to these efforts to forge a closer partnership."
"It is a fact that there have been developments in Latin America over the last twenty years and it is true that what worried us during the 1980s, namely the numerous dictatorships, has been wiped out."
"However, the drug trade, money laundering, terrorism and the huge problems caused by poverty, insecurity and unemployment in the region have not been wiped out."
"We therefore call, with the help of the European Parliament and Lady Ashton, for particular importance to be attached to sectors relating to education and culture."
"The countries of Latin America are the only countries which we can say are so closely linked - more than other third countries - to Europe on matters relating to history, education and culture, and I think that particular emphasis should be placed on these sectors."
"Mr Salafranca's report includes an integrated programme and proposes the creation of a foundation, which is also hugely important to the European Parliament, and, of course, it calls for a new and stronger role for the European Parliament in relations with these countries."
"I think that this is what we should retain from today's report."
"(NL) Madam President, in recent months, Latin America has increasingly been taking on a more clear and concrete importance in the eyes of the European Union, after years of receiving too little attention from the EU."
"The European Commission brought out a communication positing both regions of Latin America as global players and partners, and negotiations on association agreements are now well under way."
"I cannot help but stress the strategic importance of good relations with Latin America."
"What I particularly have in mind here is the ongoing negotiations for an association agreement with Central America, the latest round of which kicked off yesterday."
"The objective is to dot the final i's and to wrap up the negotiations."
"Although, in essence, I would welcome an association agreement with Latin America, I cannot stress enough that respect for human rights is of the greatest importance here. This agreement should contribute to the improvement of the human rights situation in Central America and it must be a constant incentive to these countries to respect human rights."
"This agreement should contribute to the improvement of the human rights situation in Central America and it must be a constant incentive to these countries to respect human rights."
"We are not just entering a trade agreement here, but also forging a connection with each other through the medium of political dialogues and cooperation."
"The association agreement is important for Central America."
"The region is characterised by a high level of poverty and this agreement must contribute to the economic progress of the people there."
"During the negotiations, the EU must not therefore shut its eyes to the fact that Europe and Central America are not equal partners in the agreement."
"The agreement must take sufficient account of the unequal starting points of the two regions and the asymmetry in the agreement is therefore very important."
"In brief, this must be a balanced agreement and one that does not just bring benefits to Europe and major companies established in Central America."
"No, above all, it must improve the situation of ordinary citizens and small businesses."
"To conclude, we have chosen a region-by-region approach and I would stress that we must bring things to a conclusion in that fashion, so that no single country falls behind its neighbours."
"(GA) Madam President, I welcome this report and I commend the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"I would like to draw attention to trade affairs between the European Union and Latin America."
"It must be ensured that trade affairs are discussed on a level playing field."
"European farmers and producers must adhere to many rules and they produce high quality food and goods."
"These high standards result in higher production costs for European farmers and producers and these can be disadvantageous in the market due to the importation of products of lower quality and at lower cost."
"It is not just for the benefit of European producers that we should look at this issue."
"The European Union has done excellent work as regards protecting and strengthening consumer rights and health."
"We are obliged to ensure that goods and products that are imported into Europe do not compromise these rights and do not endanger the health of European consumers."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, I will try actually to keep to one minute."
"Perhaps Francis Fukuyama was wrong when he said that liberal democracy is the end of history, but he was surely right in his assertion that liberal democracy is the best thing which can happen to people."
"If only everyone really did live in such conditions."
"Unfortunately, democracy has been substituted in Latin America by populism, and capitalism by socialism, or economic populism."
"In view of this I would like to address Mrs Ashton - Commissioner, I have an enormous request, that our experience, the money of European taxpayers and our know-how be directed, above all, to those countries which are on the road of democracy and are building a free-market economy, and not to those countries which are building populist dictatorships."
"(RO) The strategy for promoting relations with Latin America has proved to be invaluable between the time of its launch and now."
"This strategic partnership has added further consistency to relations between our regions and facilitated the funding of projects and programmes in excess of EUR 3 billion during the last 10 years."
"Fortunately, countries in the Latin American region have been more successful so far in weathering the economic and financial crisis than certain developed countries."
"However, the poverty level continues to remain extremely high or is even increasing among the disadvantaged section of the population due to the chronic nature of social polarisation and the political and institutional dysfunction in the region."
"In Bolivia, for example, approximately 60% of the population live below the poverty line."
"The figures reported for the proportion of the population living below the poverty line in Brazil and Argentina are 26% and 13.9% respectively."
"This is why I strongly support the need for development aid to be focused on creating the institutional facilities in these countries, with the aim of levelling out the social disparities."
"It is important for Mr Salafranca's report to promote the increase in dialogue in order to identify the methods for achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"However, I believe that it is vital for us to ensure that this strategy considers including civil society and non-governmental organisations in this dialogue and in the actions involved in implementing the strategy's objectives."
"Madam President, as a member of EuroLat, I commend the Spanish Presidency and Mr Salafranca for emphasising the importance of our relations with Latin America."
"Climate change and global warming should remain a priority on the political agenda between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and a commitment to Copenhagen targets should be reinforced."
"Furthermore, energy and energy-supply dialogue should be boosted to combat climate change and to aid sustainable energy consumption."
"But we have much to exchange, not only in trade but in culture and education, and the ultimate aim is that our trade relationship with Latin America is boosted by increased innovation on both sides and improved education and I would like to emphasise the need to further enhance and promote Erasmus to Latin American participants and the fantastic opportunities that it can offer personally, professionally and for future contacts and improved trade relationships between the EU and Latin America."
"(SK) I welcome the strengthening of relations between the EU and Latin America, which is one of the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, since it benefits both sides and can bring advantages for the Member States of the EU and the countries of Latin America."
"Latin America has enormous human potential, with more than 600 million people, as well as natural resources and a 10% share of global GDP."
"The EU, as the main provider of development aid, the main investor and the second largest trading partner for Latin America, should systematically consolidate its position in the region."
"Fully functional regional cooperation based on common values, such as democracy, the rule of law and the defence of human rights, for example, will require targeted improvement of the current mechanisms of the bi-regional partnership."
"I will also be promoting such an approach during the forthcoming plenary of the EuroLat assembly in Seville in May."
"(ES) Madam President, I would also like to take the opportunity of this debate to highlight a subject of great concern, a situation that we became aware of just a few days ago that relates to Colombia."
"It has been discovered that the Colombian state security services are directly implicated in persecution, creating false witness statements and criminalising members of the opposition."
"We learned this first hand from Senator Piedad CÃ³rdoba."
"It is part of the dossier that the Colombian security services are preparing in her case."
"We were informed that the Colombian Government or, in any event, that body, is seeking to artificially create links between her and guerrilla groups, namely the FARC."
"Moreover, even more seriously - and this is a direct question to Mrs Ashton - the operation called 'Operation Europe' refers to the explicit intention to pursue, clearly attack and discredit the human rights authorities in Europe, including the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"I think this is serious, very serious, and demands an explanation by the Colombian Government."
"I believe it is highly relevant in the context of this report for us to discover exactly what is correct and to find out whether the Colombian authorities are actually planning to do anything about it."
"(DE) Mr President, after more than 300 years of colonial rule and after the continent became an arena for the cold war, Latin America has now become one of the world's emerging regions."
"The fact that the Russian president Mr Medvedev has visited Central and South America is a clear indication of the fact that he is attempting to strengthen Russia's economic relationship with South America."
"It also shows that the EU is on the right track in improving its relationships with this continent, which has a larger population than the EU-27."
"However, this is not just about starting negotiations with the Mercosur trading bloc."
"It also involves all the smaller countries which do not belong to this economic region or to the Andean Community."
"The EU is not only the main investor or the most important or second most important trading partner; it is also the biggest donor of development aid."
"From a financial perspective, we already play a major role and, in my opinion, we must make use of this pole position to develop the relationship between Europe and Latin America."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and Latin America developed a strategic partnership some time ago with the aim of achieving an effective partnership between the two regions."
"I would remind you that bilateral summits have been held regularly since 1999, and this year will be no exception."
"In fact, another EU-Latin America meeting is scheduled for next May in Madrid."
"It is thus with pleasure and a strong spirit of supportiveness that I speak today in the Chamber in favour of the report by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra."
"I agree with the compliments and the congratulations that all, or most, of the speakers have expressed; congratulations that are absolutely shared and justified."
"The report, in fact, aims to consolidate the already strong political, historical, cultural and economic links that exist between the two regions, and I therefore see the foundation initiative as appropriate and completely relevant to the present."
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am keen to emphasise this specific aspect of the economy, and to quote some figures that show that this is a rapidly expanding area of primary interest, accounting for 600 million consumers, and producing essential raw materials."
"The prices of raw agricultural materials in Latin America have recently benefited from slight atmospheric disturbances, which have led to a constant and plentiful supply in many of the producing countries of the area, and to the general return of many investors."
"Moreover, I would remind you that the European Union is the primary investor in Latin America and the primary donor of development aid, with an expected investment of EUR 3 billion for the period 2007-2013."
"As my final and closing remark, Mr President, I would like to mention the topic of climate change - which was also recently addressed in the relevant committees, with the approval of important reports - to look again at a part of this resolution that has my full support."
"I therefore call for discussions and cooperation with Latin America on the fight against climate change, so that the Copenhagen objectives can be achieved more quickly."
"Cooperation with the largest developing countries is essential if Europe is to achieve the climate goals it has set itself."
"Mr President, may I just say that I would like to add my compliments on the work that has been done and the comments that have already been made."
"However, there still remain, as some people perhaps point out, some difficult questions on the issue of Colombia and its human rights record."
"In the absence of one or two of my colleagues, including Richard Howitt, who cannot be here because of the volcanoes, I must refer to what he has pointed out: that there have been particular problems affecting trade unionists in Colombia."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner and others to reflect on this in any strategy and involvement we have across this continent."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to begin - as honourable Members have done - by again congratulating Mr Salafranca for the excellent report and also - as he has done and as others have done - to thank the Spanish Presidency for the work that they, too, have undertaken in not only pulling together the work for the summit but all of the work that they have done to support the initiatives that have been undertaken."
"The forthcoming summit is an important one."
"It enables us to reinforce that relationship that honourable Members have talked about."
"We will also be holding a Foreign Ministers' meeting alongside the summit, which is particularly important to me."
"I hope we will be able to use that occasion to deepen the relationship with a number of states who will be present at the time."
"A number of honourable Members also talked about the importance of trade and the role of European businesses, with which I am in complete agreement."
"We are the biggest investor in that region."
"I was particularly pleased that colleagues talked about the role of innovation, which I think is especially important too."
"Of course, a huge emphasis, as I would expect, was placed on human rights - the importance of making sure that is clearly part of all the dynamic relationships that we have and encompasses our work."
"Honourable Members talked about the particular point made in the report about feminicide and, of course, indigenous people."
"The Commission has always defended the rights of indigenous people and will continue to monitor the projects that were being described."
"On Colombia in particular, I am very well aware of the views, not only within this House but, of course, with the European TUC and the international TUC, with which I have had links in my previous role."
"We are continuing to follow the situation very closely."
"We have taken note of the significant progress that has been made."
"Within the trade agreement, colleagues will see the importance of the robust human rights clause and the commitments that are made within that agreement, which I hope - as we monitor those - will actually go some way to alleviating the concerns, but certainly will be part of our continuing relationship with Colombia."
"I also agree about the importance of the role that we play with these countries in broader international questions."
"Brazil and Iran were specific examples given."
"I have been in discussion with Celso Amorim, the Foreign Minister of Brazil, precisely on that question and we continue to stay in touch about its importance."
"The Falklands Islands were raised."
"Member States have ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"The Falkland Islands is an associated territory to the Union and the rule of law would apply."
"Climate change is also a very important issue."
"We should remember that we have a key dialogue with this region."
"Finally, I was also very pleased that Erasmus and the importance of educational programmes in that context were mentioned."
"To end - again, my congratulations go to Mr Salafranca."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their speeches."
"I would like to say to you, Mrs Ashton, that the fundamental element that will ensure that these relations move forward in the coming years will be the mobilisation of political will."
"Political reasons were behind the ministerial dialogue in San JosÃ© in 1985; political reasons were behind the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the Rio Group in 1990; and political reasons were behind going over and above this in the summits mechanism."
"I would like to respond to Mr KoÅ¾uÅ¡nÃ­k by saying that we are indeed a community of values, and I would like to point out that in the last part-session, we adopted an important resolution on Cuba in which we called for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, who is on conditional release and is ill."
"She has just obtained Spanish nationality in a case promoted by a former MEP, Fernando FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, so that she can come to Spain to be treated."
"However, we need to move from words to actions, and this is shown in the association agreements."
"I think, Mrs Ashton, that you have negotiated the agreements with Colombia and Peru very well."
"I think that although the human rights situation in Colombia still gives cause for concern, it has improved substantially."
"The Colombian people are clamouring for peace, and this agreement is definitely deserved."
"I also sincerely believe that a majority in Parliament is in favour of this agreement."
"Mrs Ashton, we need to give the Central Americans some room to breathe in the negotiations."
"We represent 25% of their exports, and they represent 2% of ours."
"We need to be generous and, as you said, we need to re-launch the agreement with Mercosur."
"To conclude, Mr President, I think that on the one hand, the European Union is in decline, in economic terms, and on the other, it is strengthened by the presence of the High Representative."
"Therefore, we need her to make a significant effort to demonstrate our political will at the Madrid Summit and to continue keeping relations with Latin America high on the European Union's agenda."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in May."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Union is Latin America's number one trading partner and the second largest trading partner in the case of Mercosur and Chile."
"European Union Member States also provide the largest source of direct investment in Latin America."
"However, relations between the European Union and Latin America go further than the commercial aspect as they include historical, institutional and cultural elements as well."
"In this context, I believe that a trade agreement involving closer cooperation with Latin America needs to be drawn up."
"In fact, the continuing efforts to sign an association agreement with Mercosur mark the first step in this direction."
"The association agreement provides an instrument which would help promote both regions' common economic, social and geopolitical interests."
"This would also be the first intercontinental association agreement between North and South which would offer an alternative to other less equitable attempts at integration, such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas."
"Closer trade cooperation between Latin America and the European Union would facilitate the implementation of economic and social cohesion policies aimed at promoting economic development and prosperity in both regions."
"I hope that we will see a number of satisfactory conclusions pointing in this direction, presented at the summit to be held between the European Union and Mercosur on 17 May."
"Agenda (continuation): see Minutes"
"Kyrgyzstan (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Kyrgyzstan."
"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement on Kyrgyzstan."
"As this House knows very well, the situation on the ground remains somewhat fluid and tense."
"Kyrgyzstan has attracted quite some media and political attention, and I have followed developments closely from the beginning, making two statements, one on 7 April and the other on 8 April."
"I sent a delegation almost immediately, headed by the EU Special Representative, Pierre Morel, to the country and we stayed in close contact throughout his visit."
"The coordinated EU-UN-OSCE effort that started last week in Bishkek continues at the moment and will continue until the crisis and its consequences are overcome."
"Yesterday, I spoke with the Kazakh Foreign Minister Saudabayev, who today is visiting Bishkek as Chair-in-Office of the OSCE, and who has literally just sent me a message to say that he has completed his tasks."
"The resignation of the President, on the basis of Article 50 of the present Kyrgyz Constitution, and his departure from the country is expected to reduce political tension."
"However, that is not the end of the crisis, and we have important work to do."
"Most importantly, we have to ensure stability and public order, and while the situation has generally calmed down, violence continues."
"Reports told us yesterday that as many as five people were killed in riots in the suburbs of Bishkek."
"All sides need to be careful and avoid provocation."
"The restoration of law and order must be a priority."
"Citizens and businesses in Kyrgyzstan need to be able to go about their daily life without fear for their lives or for their physical integrity."
"The second issue concerns the legitimacy of the provisional government."
"Although President Bakiyev has officially resigned, the provisional government needs to commit to a clear plan for how to return to constitutional and democratic order and the rule of law."
"Elements of such a 'roadmap' have been announced - a new constitution is being drawn up and submitted to referendum and presidential and parliamentary elections are to be held."
"We will be happy to look at such a plan."
"What is important for us in this context is that the constitutional process is inclusive and participatory."
"Representatives of all parties and ethnic groups should be able to contribute to a new draft constitution before it is submitted to a referendum."
"The early indications - I can tell honourable Members - are encouraging."
"I hope these will be confirmed over the coming days, and I will discuss this with Ministers in Luxembourg on Monday."
"If we are satisfied the provisional government is committed to a quick return to legitimacy and genuinely wants to join the democratic family, we will be ready to provide the necessary political, financial and technical support."
"With the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, we could contribute to the work on constitutional reform and the updating of electoral legislation."
"We know from the presidential elections last year that there is considerable room for progress."
"With the OSCE, we are willing to work on the preparations and modalities for monitoring the elections and, with the people of Kyrgyzstan, we are ready to do what we can to help turn their aspirations for a democratic and open society into reality."
"Thirdly, it is clear that Kyrgyzstan needs material assistance."
"In the very short term, we are willing to address any humanitarian needs that recent events might have created."
"On the basis of the information that we have had from our partners in the field - the Red Cross and the UN Development Programme - there do not seem to be major unmet humanitarian needs at this stage."
"However, there may be specific medical needs."
"The Commission, through DG ECHO, will, of course, keep monitoring the humanitarian situation in the country and adjust as necessary."
"We will continue the assistance that is already ongoing, notably in the fields of human rights, education and poverty eradication."
"Fourthly, after the dramatic events of the last two weeks, there is a need for accountability and justice."
"More than 80 persons died and many hundreds were wounded from gunfire opened against demonstrators in Bishkek."
"These events cannot simply be put on one side."
"We need clarity brought on what actually happened, on who was responsible, and on what needs to be done to avoid this ever being repeated in the future."
"Finally, as the recent crisis has shown, there is a need for genuine economic and social reforms."
"Unfortunately, the example of Kyrgyzstan shows how bad government and the lack of genuine reform can bring political instability and ultimately violence."
"The upheaval and the widespread looting that followed, and now the rise in organised, large-scale crime, further aggravates the situation."
"I will discuss with Ministers on Monday the political framework in which the European Union will be ready to address the most pressing needs, but of course, today, I am very interested to hear the views of the honourable Members on this matter."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you very much for your assessment of the situation."
"I believe your assessment to be correct that we should first try to restore law and order and safeguard human lives and then begin to build on this foundation."
"On the other hand, and you explained this in your last remark, the extent to which economic and social development is needed is clear, because this is also an important yardstick for political stability."
"Of course, this also includes equality, which often suffers as a result of corruption and other similar factors."
"Whether justifiably or not, this was obviously one of the causes of the clashes."
"We must be aware that these countries are sufficiently unstable that our efforts to bring about stability by contributing to improved state-building, democracy and the rule of law are of crucial importance."
"The whole region is of major strategic significance to us, not just the individual countries."
"This relates not only to the available energy sources, but to the area as a whole, in particular, if we consider the religious orientation of the majority of the former republics of the Soviet Union."
"If this were to take the form of fundamentalism, the results could be catastrophic for us."
"For this reason, providing aid to these countries is of extreme importance, not only from the perspective of the aid itself, but also in relation to our interests."
"We should remember that the neighbouring countries in the region, some of which are very large, are responsible for ensuring that these weaknesses are not exploited with the aim of rebuilding old power relationships that would not allow for modern development."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would also like to thank you for your statement."
"A dictator or a president who behaves like a dictator is removed from power."
"His successor celebrates and is pleased to be able to introduce democracy for his subjects."
"After a few months, he is in the same position and it seems as if democracy has only been restored for the purpose of making comfortable, well-paid positions available to his son or other family members."
"We hope that this cycle is not beginning again and that Mrs Otunbayeva has a different approach."
"Her past, and the attitude that she has often demonstrated, are indicators of this."
"However, indicators are not enough."
"We need real proof."
"If she is not to suffer the same fate as her predecessor, she must take a different approach and ensure that she helps the people of her country."
"I hope that the president who has been thrown out of office will be sensible enough not to spread new discord and will make a genuine attempt to live a peaceful life in exile, which will give the Kyrgyz population the chance to build a democratic state."
"Unfortunately, the situation that I have described does not apply only to Kyrgyzstan."
"Similar conditions can also be found in other countries."
"We wish the representative for Kazakhstan success with his task on behalf of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)."
"However, the situation in Kazakhstan is also far from ideal."
"The same thing also applies to Uzbekistan and to other countries."
"The question of how we can encourage the development of democracy there - because it is not a product that we can simply deliver, it must emerge in these countries - is one that we must follow up."
"This is a very sensitive region, as Mr Brok has already said."
"Mr Morel is doing a good job as the Special Representative, but this is not enough."
"I would like to remind everyone that during the German Presidency with Dr Steinmeier, a strategy for Central Asia was drawn up which we have heard very little about recently."
"Therefore, I would like to ask you to take up this strategy again and to transform it into a stability strategy for the region."
"This is not only about the energy supply from Turkmenistan through to Kazakhstan. It is also a question of the stability and, in particular, the political stability of a region which is very close to Afghanistan."
"We know that in some countries, such as Uzbekistan, the situation is very fragile and problematic."
"Of course, it is ultimately a question of humanity, because there really should not be any victims at all."
"Against this background, we need to make a new attempt to put in place a strategy for Central Asia which covers the economy, democracy and humanity."
"I would ask you to use the case of Kyrgyzstan as the opportunity to renew this strategy for Central Asia and to give it a new stimulus."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, there is a wonderful concluding passage in the Kyrgyz epic Manas - which is no small work of literature, being 20 times longer than the Odyssey and the Iliad put together and also an aid to understanding this country's history - where the wife of the hero who represents the whole population sets out to safeguard his memory against foreign attacks and to protect his tomb. In the end, she decides that the name on his tomb should be that of his wife, instead of the hero Manas, precisely to ensure that it remains intact in the face of enemy attacks."
"This type of dedication for the common good, for the people, should be what we expect from the new Kyrgyz ruling class, which is not, in point of fact, all that new."
"Of course, I advise the High Representative to adopt a constructive and I would say positive, yet cautious attitude towards the interim government, but also to call for a series of reforms, a set of measures, which must be clear."
"Not only an international board of enquiry into what has taken place, not only a clear schedule for restoring democratic rules - because this interim government, by its very definition, is not sanctioned as a legitimate government by the popular vote - but also reforms to oppose corruption firmly and effectively, and ultimately to make Kyrgyzstan independent from the judiciary, which is very far removed from the current situation."
"Also - and this is linked to both the issue of the judiciary and to corruption - to streamline what is an extremely oppressive bureaucratic nomenclature and public administration."
"In fact, this is the first real test of the European Union's new Central Asia strategy in a critical, emergency situation of the type currently existing in Kyrgyzstan."
"We must not let this country, where the influence of the United States is now very limited, end up in the rather suffocating grip of present-day Russia, and so I believe that this is an opportunity for us all to make a commitment."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, we know how much people hoped in 2005 at the time of the Tulip Revolution that everything would change when a new president came into office who genuinely took seriously the needs and interests of the people with regard to democracy and codetermination."
"Unfortunately, that was not the case and now he has suffered the same fate as his predecessor."
"The European Union must exert significance influence in this case."
"Baroness Ashton, I welcomed the fact that you said that you have sent the Special Representative, Mr Morel, to the region."
"I think that was both sensible and useful."
"However, it is equally necessary for the EU now to revise its strategy for Central Asia to make it really effective."
"I hope the Council will begin work on this next Monday."
"My question is: How do you intend to tackle this?"
"How do you plan to ensure that a genuinely comprehensive process is put in place for developing a constitution which involves everyone, as you have proposed?"
"We need to help this region and Kyrgyzstan to move towards cooperation and away from confrontation."
"I believe that this is important for the future of the entire region and beyond."
"(FR) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Kyrgyzstan is, in fact, particularly unstable."
"Nevertheless, this country has been, and perhaps still is, one of those that seemed most open to the setting up of democratic institutions."
"The Tulip revolution in 2005 once again raised immense hope."
"Mr Bakiyev has failed; he has been incapable of responding to the population's needs and demands; he has allowed corruption to develop, and played his own part in it with a certain clannishness; he has emptied the coffers, if some statements are to be believed; and he has installed an increasingly authoritarian regime, for which political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists have paid a heavy price."
"After the riots of 7 April, a provisional government was put in place, but for all that, Mr Bakiyev does not seem to have given up, even though he has left the country, and yesterday new riots actually took place, as you said, in the south of the country and around the capital."
"Commissioner, this country is actually of considerable strategic importance, and not only in military terms."
"It must not be the playing field of certain major powers."
"Despite some discussions, the European Union still does not have a great enough presence in this region of the world."
"Its support and its diplomatic presence remain half-hearted."
"One only has to read the stories that are breaking at present on the situation in that country to be persuaded of this."
"This is not just about the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan, the country that currently holds the presidency of the OECD."
"However, the EU's support is essential to ensure that country's independence."
"You are right, Baroness Ashton; priority must go to re-establishing the rule of law, but we must very quickly go beyond that and, as some of my fellow Members have already said, implement a proper strategy for this region of the world."
"Yes, we must help this country to combat poverty; 40% of the population there lives below the poverty threshold."
"Yes, we must facilitate economic development and, as you said, especially with regard to education, health but also water, which is an essential priority in this region of the world."
"Yes, of course, we must support democracy and the defence of human rights."
"This is now a matter of the utmost urgency."
"Our undertaking, Commissioner, can and must be to prevent this country from swinging towards fundamentalism and a new authoritarian regime."
"It is not a case of our interfering in the internal affairs of that country but, on the contrary, of helping the Kyrgyz people to once again trust in democracy."
"This is the key to ensuring that the country plays a major role in this region of the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Kyrgyzstan is very important for the stability of Central Asia, a region in which Europe has particular interests relating to the supply of raw materials and energy."
"Following the unrest of 7 April, it is necessary to re-establish conditions that will lead to the free, legal and rapid election of a democratic regime, if this is compatible with the local situation."
"It is worrying that a considerable haul of weapons has been stolen by criminal gangs, with all the risks of increased lawlessness, armed conflicts and terrorism in the area that this entails."
"Europe and others, including the OSCE, could contribute to helping the country develop institutions that are stable, operational, less corrupt and more democratic."
"One such show of support could be an observation mission for the coming elections."
"We cannot pretend, however, that a new constitution or parliamentary regime will be enough to bring about true democracy; this inevitably depends on the political growth of citizens and a widespread awareness of the law and the rights of individuals."
"We must provide long-term assistance in this area."
"Mr President, last week's riots have led Kyrgyzstan into a political, judicial and economic crisis."
"Its constitutional court was practically disbanded and the interim government's actions appear uncoordinated."
"Meanwhile, the brother of Kurmanbek Bakiyev has announced that the hand-written resignation statement is a fake and that Bakiyev did not himself resign."
"According to eye-witnesses, new local groups trying to take over regional governments have emerged."
"Similarly, ethnic-based groupings appear, creating fear of more ethnic violence."
"Criminal groups operate freely in the country."
"Large numbers of weapons are being circulated and robberies are taking place."
"Safety, security and the interests of the EU citizens in this country are still endangered."
"The present interim government is unable to counter any of these threats."
"The situation is completely unclear for the local people."
"High Representative Ashton has issued two statements expressing her concern, but more active and practical actions are urgently needed instead."
"It is important that the EU take a decisive position on the situation in Kyrgyzstan in this strategically important country."
"We need to be more present there, cooperating with the UN, USA and OSCE to defend the interests of Kyrgyzstani and EU citizens who are currently unable to protect their lives and defend their property."
"It is clear that the EU should pursue an independent investigation into the causes and effects of the riots."
"About the material resources of the Kyrgyz Bank and the agency for investment and development: they need to be evaluated before assigning any further financial assistance."
"Inactivity and hesitancy on the EU's part and an absence of real strategy and tactics may lead to very dangerous developments and undermine the EU's own economic and political interests and credibility in the region and in the rest of the world."
"(EL) Mr President, Lady Ashton, in the twenty years that it has been independent, Kyrgyzstan has been governed by a corrupt regime and little progress has been made in improving its democratic institutions."
"As regards the last fifteen years, I can give you my own assurance, having been personally involved in my capacity as a member of the OSCE and otherwise."
"The people who were governing up to yesterday and the people who overturned them are all cogs in the same corrupt system."
"The army is in the capital, carrying out searches and making arrests as we speak."
"Despite this, we need to give the present regime a chance, because we are in the final stage before civil war and the break up of the country."
"The people of Kyrgyzstan are a peace-loving people and I imagine that many of you will have got to know them through the book by the famous author Chingiz Aitmatov, who was ambassador in Brussels up to 4 years ago."
"However, financial distress and social inequalities, as well as the interventions of foreign countries, have caused explosions which may, on occasion, reach the limits of civil war, and here I would disagree slightly as to whether the people of Kyrgyzstan can ward off terrorism."
"As I said, the danger of Kyrgyzstan splitting into North and South is real and is being cultivated by foreign agents, while its membership of the OSCE and the constant presence of the OSCE in Kyrgyzstan does not appear to be bearing fruit in terms of democratisation."
"Of course, there is a permanent humanitarian crisis which may not be acute, but there has been no modernisation and no improvement in democratic institutions over all these years."
"People are living well below the poverty line."
"That is why the European Parliament needs to intervene, in liaison with the other institutions of the European Union, with the Commission and the Council, and review the strategy followed to date in the area."
"A strong European Parliament delegation must monitor progress in democratisation and grant money in a controlled manner, with a view to developing institutions and education, because the destabilisation of Kyrgyzstan is a major danger for the destabilisation of the whole of Central and Western Asia, and of Europe."
"If the European Union wants to play an effective peacekeeping role, it needs to act now."
"(RO) The situation in Kyrgyzstan is giving particular cause for concern."
"This country has a strategic position in Central Asia."
"It hosts on its territory a US military base making a major contribution to the operations in Afghanistan, as well as Russian troops."
"It is unfortunate that the protests of the last few weeks have degenerated into violence and have resulted in the loss of human life."
"The authorities must take measures aimed at protecting civilian lives."
"Just yesterday, new clashes took place among ethnic Kyrgyz, Russians and Turks."
"Given that large Russian and Uzbek communities live in this country, if interethnic clashes continue, the stability of the whole region will be affected."
"Mrs Ashton, the European Union must focus particular attention on the conflict in Kyrgyzstan, provide humanitarian aid and get involved in stabilising the situation."
"(SL) Madam Ashton, we are here to discuss the alarming events in Kyrgyzstan and to help as much as we can to stabilise the situation in this country."
"A proactive approach by the European Union towards Kyrgyzstan is particularly important, but it is equally important that we also maintain a high level of commitment in principle with regard to another issue, which has been removed from this sitting's agenda."
"However, because it is topical and because human lives are at stake, I feel obliged to call your attention to it."
"I am talking about the plight of Sahrawi activists, peacekeepers from Western Sahara being detained in Moroccan prisons, who are on hunger strike and are risking their lives."
"Amnesty International has also called our attention to their plight."
"I would therefore ask, Madam Ashton, that you and your colleagues pay immediate attention to this problem because, otherwise, it might be too late."
"Mr President, recent events in Bishkek are alarming and a sad end to the 2005 Tulip Revolution, or Colour Revolution, when President Bakiyev had promised democracy and human rights and instead delivered corruption, nepotism and increasing autocracy."
"Kyrgyzstan remains the smallest and poorest country in Central Asia and has undergone a worrying infiltration of radical Islamists in the Fergana Valley in recent years, so stability must be the EU's priority for the region."
"It is right and proper now to recognise the new Otunbayeva government, an unusual example where we have a common interest with that of Russia, which actually supported the revolution and overthrow of the Bakiyev regime."
"President Roza Otunbayeva served briefly as Ambassador to the United Kingdom, so she knows the workings of the European Union well."
"Lastly, Central Asia is a strategic region for reasons of energy and global security and the operational capability of the US air base in Kyrgyzstan is vitally important to support ISAF in Afghanistan as well."
"(PL) Mr President, five years after the Tulip Revolution, when President Akayev stood down, a bloody revolution has taken place."
"Two reasons can, of course, be given."
"Firstly, the problem of nepotism and corruption and hence, the absence of the foundations of a democratic state, and secondly, the country's financial and economic problems."
"Mrs Ashton's initiative, which has meant that Mr Morel can, today, give us a full report on what is really happening in Kyrgyzstan, seems fairly important."
"I would like to make a fervent appeal in relation to the situation in Kyrgyzstan."
"The country is, we know, an area of Russian influence, and also has an American military base."
"The European Union's active participation should be based, principally, on building the foundations of a democratic country, and also on ensuring internal security."
"Over 80 fatalities is a bad signal for the building of Kyrgyzstan."
"So I repeat my fervent appeal and have my fingers crossed for Mrs Ashton's mission."
"(RO) Kurmanbek Bakiyev is neither the first, nor will he definitely be the last, political leader to cause disappointment and disillusionment and be treated like a dictator, after the glimmer of hope there was at the very start and after his name was initially associated with democratic optimism."
"There is a simple explanation for this situation."
"Due to the lack of stable institutions, politicians are likely to cause disappointment and get involved in this cycle of conflict, corruption and blackmail."
"None of us should forget that President Bakiyev has exploited the fact that there is a Russian and a US military base on the territory of Kyrgyzstan to continually blackmail the West."
"Therefore, the solution lies in setting up institutions created by consent, based on a broad consultation process and a wide consensus and degree of compromise among the political forces."
"However, the main priority is to urgently put an end to the violence, as mentioned by the High Representative."
"The violence is serious and a solution must be found as quickly as possible to put an end to it because, otherwise, it will prevent a process of political construction from getting under way."
"(IT) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Kyrgyzstan is alarming to say the least, especially if we consider the statements made by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, in whose opinion Kyrgyzstan's fate seems to lean ever closer to the Russian economic and border space."
"One week after the fall of the government of former President Bakiyev, who fled his country by plane on 15 April, no one has any idea about the country's final political destination or future political intentions."
"What is clear, however, is the role of the Russian Ministry of Defence in facilitating the flight of former President Bakiyev after people took to the streets calling for his resignation."
"Many weapons are in circulation in Kyrgyzstan, a small country with just 5.3 million inhabitants, and the only country in the world to house both a US and a Russian military base."
"The tension is now spreading to neighbouring countries, and the European Union must take note of the priority and the opportunity arising at this time, which is, above all, to put paid to a possible civil war and help the country move towards a democratic parliamentary republic with a stable presidency within the next six months."
"All this, as you said Baroness Ashton, can happen if we are able to make proactive contributions of two kinds: firstly, a diplomatic contribution, but also - as you stated, High Representative - a substantial and material contribution."
"Our timeliness in providing aid to reduce and weaken all social tension will be decisive."
"Baroness Ashton, let us act quickly and for the best, because this will be another important test for Europe."
"We are not in Haiti, but in Kyrgyzstan."
"Let us at least try to get there in time on this occasion."
"(DE) Mr President, when the Soviet Union broke up at the beginning of the 1990s, many people believed that the young democracies would develop almost of their own accord."
"Now we know that these new states have inherited huge problems from the Soviet Union."
"During the Soviet era, differences between the ethnic groups were largely suppressed, which is why there is so much religious and cultural conflict in these countries today."
"Democracy does not just develop overnight and it will not emerge at all while corrupt clans are growing rich at the expense of the country and its citizens."
"Rumour has it that the snipers who shot into the crowd in Bishkek were Uzbek and Tajik mercenaries."
"It seems that this was an attempt to provoke an international conflict which could put the whole of Central Asia at risk."
"European foreign policy should help to defuse the situation."
"However, military intervention is the wrong approach, as is clearly shown by the German presence in Afghanistan."
"It is essential to provide intelligent, targeted economic and development aid."
"We must give priority to combating corruption and to depriving the local clans of their power."
"It is really only then that democracy will have a genuine chance in Central Asia."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Europeana project is taking on a new, ambitious dimension."
"With this EU digital library, the diversity and the wealth of our culture will be made accessible."
"It is essential that our different countries be heavily involved in this project."
"A crucial aspect of this initiative concerns a fundamental value: respect for cultural and linguistic diversity."
"One of our continent's horizons is Africa, but we have blackened that horizon with slavery and colonialism."
"We have a duty of recognition and reparation towards its peoples."
"Financial compensation could not meet this need alone, but thanks to the Europeana project, we can help to return to the African peoples part of their culture in terms of its oral literature."
"Amadou HampÃ¢tÃ© BÃ¢, a Malian intellectual, said: 'In Africa, when an old person dies, it is a library that burns'."
"Working to digitise works of oral literature, which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists, and encouraging free access to them through the Europeana project, thereby making them universal in scale, would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity's cultural diversity, to which we are all attached."
"Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, today I sit in the Commission's space as well."
"The honourable Members have made a number of important points and I will try in the short time I have to capture and address as many of them as possible."
"Mr Brok, with Mr Tannock and others, talked about the importance of this being one of the poorest countries in Central Asia and, of course, one of the main recipients of EU assistance per capita."
"I could not agree more that social and economic development is essential as part of the strategy that we need to put forward."
"Mrs Swoboda talked too about the importance of making sure that what we have before us is a genuine political reform."
"We are working very closely with the UN and with the OSCE."
"Together, the people who have been in the region in the last few days have made this point consistently that we need to see the importance of reform as central to what happens next and I agree completely about the political stability of the region."
"It is very important."
"We need to look again very carefully."
"There is a strategy for this part of Central Asia, it will be reviewed, but I am looking at it in the context of the External Action Service and what we should be doing within this region to pull together the different elements of Commission and Council support."
"Mr Rinaldi and others too I think rightly described that we need to be cautious, positive and constructive in our attitude and I would agree too with a number of honourable Members who talked about the value and importance of the rule of law."
"It is core to everything that we will do in the country to make sure that there is indeed the rule of law in operation and that applies in the legal system of course, but also in the political and constitutional reform that is so essential."
"Mr Lunacek talked about the elections falling - I think that the actual words were used in the briefing I had - significantly short of the standards that we would wish to have internationally."
"And I think the elements which I would put into the mix of things would include financial support, of course, and I have mentioned the rule of law, political and constitutional reform and the elections and the link that we want to make economically too."
"One small example of that, of course, is that it is one of the great water-rich countries in that region, and it provides water to the regions, as honourable Members will know."
"We have been assisting them with their water management for more than five years, and I hope that we will be able to return to that work which is so essential as soon as the crisis is overcome and we have a legitimate government firmly in place."
"Those are just some of the elements that I would include."
"I think that we are probably right in the level of presence in the region."
"Pierre Morel has been there for several days."
"He has just come back."
"He will be briefing Mr Borys of the AFET Committee on 27 April to bring the committee up to date with all the events."
"We are in touch by text every few hours and we have spoken several times and he has been in touch of course with colleagues too."
"We have had a strong presence in him, I pay tribute to him and to his team for the work that they have done."
"The importance of democracy, as Mr Provera said, can never be underestimated, in my view; we have got to get beyond some of the issues that Ms Vaidere talked about: the instability, rumours, insecurities, the issues, which are clearly of enormous importance and, as I have indicated, we have set out what we wanted to do over these first vital few days which I hope honourable Members will feel has been responsive."
"I think that the final thing that I would say is this, that some of the current members of the government in formation are the former human rights defenders on the opposition who were oppressed by the former President and who were supported by the European Union including, of course, Members of this House."
"So, although I do not have any illusions about the nature of politics in this country and, indeed, in the region, I think that we have to try and give this government a chance to form itself properly, to agree to do the political and constitutional reforms, which are going to be so essential, to hold the elections it says it will have and, if it is willing to do those things, to support it now into the future."
"And on that basis, I am very grateful for the comments which have been made and we will pursue the strategy as I have outlined."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in May."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the popular unrest that has broken out in recent days in the capital of Kyrgyzstan has halted the progress of the 'Tulip Revolution' that kindled hopes of democratic change in the former Soviet republic in 2005."
"The European Parliament is following the development of the political crisis in the country with great concern. This is not merely because of the country's crucial geostrategic position for Russia and the United States, but also because the stability of Central Asia, its political and economic development and interregional cooperation is of interest to the EU, not least, due to the importance of Central Asia for our energy supplies and our economic and trade partnership."
"The risk of civil war breaking out and of a 'second Afghanistan' must be averted."
"We put our faith in the diplomatic mediation that the Presidents of the United States, Russia and Kazakhstan - the latter in his capacity as the current president of the OSCE - are deploying in their negotiations with the interim Kyrgyz Government for the establishment of public order and constitutional legality, in order that free elections can be held and the country's problems resolved."
"As Chair of the EU-Central Asia delegation, I hope, even despite the recent ethnic clashes, that we will do everything we can to bring about national peace and the lasting return of democratic life in Kyrgyzstan."
"Stabilisation of the situation in Central Asia will guarantee good cooperation with the EU."
"No one is in any doubt that Kyrgyzstan plays a special role here."
"Kyrgyzstan is important to the European Union for strategic reasons - as a country which has sources of energy and natural resources, and because it is host to an American military base which is supporting NATO forces in Afghanistan."
"At the same time, the failure to carry out suitable reforms after Kyrgyzstan gained independence has led to the dramatic situation which we are seeing today."
"At present, let us concentrate on ensuring security to civilians and on giving them humanitarian aid."
"In addition, we should take every possible measure to prevent radicalisation of the country."
"We must not allow civil war to break out."
"In the long-term perspective, it is essential to develop a new strategy for the entire region."
"We need the rapid development of a specific EU position covering key aspects such as preventing religious fundamentalism, combating poverty and corruption, building civil society, the defence of human rights and democratisation."
"In particular, we should send a team of observers to the next elections."
"We have to keep abreast of what is happening and, while avoiding interference in internal affairs, we should do everything to help Kyrgyzstan turn to democracy and, after the situation stabilises, to carry out effective reforms."
"I think that sending further aid from the EU to Kyrgyzstan must be conditional on the introduction of reforms which will ensure law and order and respect for human rights."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I welcome the fact that the European Union's Special Representative has been sent to Kyrgyzstan."
"We must know what the plans of the interim government there are. It must be guaranteed that there will be an end to violence in Kyrgyzstan, and the development of the rule of law and democracy there must be ensured."
"During the revolution in Kyrgyzstan, the forces which came to power blamed President Bakiyev for restrictions on the free press, violence against journalists, the arrest of opposition leaders, corruption, a move away from democratic values and the country's poor economic situation."
"Our expectation should thus be to see Kyrgyzstan change before long into a democratic state governed by the rule of law."
"At the same time, our hope will only be justified if we ourselves are prepared to direct resources into implementing this plan, because Kyrgyzstan's struggling economy cannot afford the necessary support for carrying out the long-awaited social, economic and political reforms."
"With the aim being to create sustainable development in the Central Asian region, we must, as well as offering economic help, also offer the interim government our know-how in carrying out reforms, just as we have done in Kosovo, Macedonia and elsewhere."
"In this area, it is worth noting that Estonia has given this type of help to Ukraine as well as to Georgia, which shows that our experience of communicating with the people living in the area of the former Soviet Union cannot be underestimated."
"With the change of regime which is taking place, we cannot miss any opportunity to facilitate a move towards democratic values in Kyrgyzstan."
"It would therefore be irresponsible of us to leave Kyrgyzstan without support and make it dependent on some of its large neighbours."
"EU - Canada Summit (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the EU-Canada Summit."
"Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, Canada is one of the oldest and most like-minded partners of the European Union."
"We work together on a wide range of issues - both bilaterally and, of course, around the world."
"Our relationship is anchored in a shared history that goes back a long way and by common values that are deeply held."
"It is on that basis that we cooperate to protect our common interests."
"We do so of course for the benefit of citizens in Europe and in Canada, but also to promote security and prosperity worldwide."
"So it is an important relationship."
"We need to nurture and invest in it, so that we realise its full potential."
"That is the purpose of the next EU-Canada Summit which will take place in Brussels on 5 May."
"The timing is fortunate. Because it means that, as Canada is chairing the G8 and G20 summit at the end of June, our EU-Canada Summit allows us to take stock and align our strategies on global themes that will figure on the G8 and G20 summits, for example, how to promote a sustainable economic recovery, cooperation on financial market reform and regulation, climate change and combating nuclear proliferation."
"I attended the G8 foreign ministers meeting recently in Canada where, indeed, many of these issues were discussed."
"We will also have the chance to discuss EU-Canada bilateral relations and how we work together on regional crises."
"Our aim is to have a focused, business-like summit."
"With our bilateral relations, the summit will deal with efforts to upgrade and modernise the EU-Canada relationship."
"It will offer us an excellent opportunity to provide support at the highest political level to reach an ambitious comprehensive economic and trade agreement as soon as possible."
"We will take stock of the progress made during the first three rounds of negotiations but also give new impetus to these negotiations, bearing in mind its importance to expand trade and job creation."
"On trade more generally, the summit should send a clear signal that the EU and Canada reject protectionism, recalling our commitment to reaching an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced conclusion of the Doha Development Round."
"The summit should also address the subject of reciprocal visa-free travel."
"Our goal is clear: we want visa-free travel to Canada for all EU citizens as soon as possible."
"We will also have a chance to discuss our crisis management cooperation which, I am pleased to say, is expanding rapidly."
"We have several crisis management operations ongoing, notably our police mission in Afghanistan, where our cooperation with Canada is exemplary."
"Haiti will also be on the agenda of the summit for obvious reasons."
"Canada plays a very important role in Haiti, and one of the areas where we can and should strengthen our joint efforts is in linking crisis management to longer-term development."
"This was also the point I stressed during the New York conference on Haiti on 31 March which was co-chaired by both the EU and Canada, along with France, Spain and Brazil."
"Along with my fellow Commissioners for Development, Andris Piebalgs, and for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, Kristalina Georgieva, I was pleased to announce at New York that the EU will contribute over EUR 1.2 billion to Haiti's reconstruction and development."
"The EU and Canada both have a long-term commitment to assist Haiti on the path to reconstruction; to rebuild for a better future."
"The summit will cover climate change."
"Taking into account the post-Copenhagen context, adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will continue to top the agenda and will require supportive energy policies."
"There is wide support for the idea that EU-Canada cooperation should focus on financing mechanisms as well as on support to third countries' clean development."
"The consequence of climate change for the Arctic will be another important element of our discussions at the summit."
"Nowhere are the effects of climate change more keenly felt than in the Arctic region."
"Environmental changes have a growing impact on the Arctic's people, biodiversity and landscape - both on land and at sea."
"Protecting the region, including its population, is a key objective of the EU's evolving Arctic Policy, as honourable Members may recall from my presentation during the March Plenary session."
"With more than 40% of its land mass in the North, Canada shares our interest in protecting the Arctic environment and ensuring the sustainable economic and social development of the region."
"Finally, when we talk about upgrading and modernising the EU-Canada relationship, we have the 1976 European Community-Canada framework agreement."
"This is still in force but outdated."
"EU-Canada cooperation has extended to other fields such as foreign and security policy and closer cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"So we need a modernised framework agreement to act as an umbrella for all our sectoral agreements, including the comprehensive economic and trade agreement and we are holding exploratory talks with Canada to upgrade that agreement at the present time."
"In a world of big challenges and where change is constant, we need partners."
"Canada is among the most important the European Union has."
"We aim for a productive summit with clear results."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Baroness Ashton, for your comprehensive statement."
"As vice-chair of the delegation for relations with Canada in the European Parliament, I am particularly pleased that we are discussing in Parliament the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit."
"As you know, the vote has unfortunately been postponed until the beginning of May."
"However, I would like to present briefly the points that are important to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Since 1959, Canada has been one of the closest and the oldest partners of the European Union."
"Canada and the European Union share many common values and are firmly in favour of a multilateral approach to tackling global challenges."
"In 2010, Canada holds the G8 Presidency and will host the next G20 summit."
"With regard to the current negotiations for a comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, it is important for us to deepen and strengthen the good relationship between the two partners at the forthcoming summit."
"For this reason, we are calling in our joint resolution for a coordinated and coherent approach to the challenges which face us, in particular, with regard to the economic and financial crisis, foreign and security policy, development cooperation, climate and energy policy and the negotiations in the Doha round."
"However, we are also calling for the problem of the visa requirement that has been partially reintroduced by the Canadian Government for EU citizens from the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania to be resolved during the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit."
"Against this background, we very much welcome the opening of a visa office in the Canadian Embassy in Prague and the establishment of an expert working group on this issue."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise once again that I am convinced that the EU-Canada Summit will deepen the already close political relationship between the two parties."
"Thank you for your commitment and your attention."
"As Mrs Ashton, the High Representative, has also said, Canada is one of the European Union's oldest partners, and this year's summit is important in order to continue and consolidate this close cooperation in every area: economic, trade, climate change and military."
"Indeed, I wish to welcome the measures which have been taken so far aimed at signing an EU-Canada trade agreement and I hope that this year's meeting will give the necessary impetus to finalise it."
"Bearing in mind the current economic situation and state of the climate, I must emphasise the need for close cooperation in order to identify alternatives to the traditional sources for producing energy, which will respect the particular features of both states, the European Union and Canada, which are involved in developing and using low carbon technology."
"At the same time, cooperation should also be promoted in the energy-climate sector and maritime sector in the Arctic region."
"There are also sensitive issues which will be touched on at the summit."
"I am referring here to ecological issues, global warming, ACTA, CETA, the banking sector, bringing stability to financial and economic markets, the CITES conference and the EU-Canada agreement on PNR information."
"I think that, bearing in mind the experiences from the past, the European Union and Canada will manage to resolve as many of these issues as possible."
"However, these issues must be approached with tact and understanding, without any recriminations, simply looking ahead to the future and taking into account the interests of citizens on both sides."
"Guaranteeing reciprocity in bilateral relations is one of the European Union's basic principles."
"We hope that, in the near future, Canada will waive the visa requirements for Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian nationals, thereby ensuring fair and equal treatment for all European Union citizens."
"Finally, bearing in mind that the European Parliament's opinion is required to sign any international treaty, it must be involved and consulted right at the initial phase of any project."
"I take this opportunity to ask the Commission to establish effective communication with the European Parliament in order to achieve sustainable results."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between the EU and Canada works very well, not only in the area of the economy, but also on questions of foreign policy, such as Iran, Afghanistan, Haiti and other similar cases."
"Despite this, we are faced with a number of serious challenges."
"I am sure that we can overcome them, because we have such a close friendship and partnership."
"I am thinking about five points in particular."
"Firstly, we must do the job of regulating the financial sector properly."
"A great deal was promised by the G20 and I believe that it is important for it to be clearly shown at the G20 summit in Toronto, which is hosted by Canada, that the G20 countries are taking concrete measures and not just making promises."
"My second point has already been mentioned."
"We have very similar objectives with regard to climate policy."
"We in Europe can definitely learn from Canada about carbon capture and storage projects and other developments in this sector."
"We hope to be able to agree on joint standards for reductions."
"My third point concerns the need for a new trade agreement and I believe that our objectives are very similar in this area as well."
"I would like to highlight two points where action is needed and where we intend to move closer together, but still remain some distance apart."
"One of these concerns visa-free travel, which you, Baroness Ashton, have already referred to."
"I hope that it will be possible to treat ethnic minorities from EU Member States in the same way as all other EU citizens."
"My last point relates to the passenger data agreement which expired in the autumn of last year."
"It is de facto still in force, but no longer has a basis in law."
"We need a new legal basis, so that we can produce a new agreement."
"This new legal basis must ensure that civil rights are respected."
"Modern technological opportunities for networking should not be used to make all the information on names, dates of birth, flight details, credit cards, and so on, readily available in such a way that this information can be misused."
"We hope that we can work together to create a legal basis which corresponds to our European concept of civil rights."
"Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Canada is a good friend and an important partner of the EU."
"It is also an important international player and has long been a mature democracy which we can learn a lot from. However, because it is a long time since we have adopted a resolution on Canada in this House, we should take the opportunity to look more seriously at the relationship between Europe and Canada than this resolution does."
"I find it rather embarrassing that the resolution refers to the many common challenges, but does not include the policy on the Arctic among them."
"There is no mention of protecting the Arctic using targets and standards."
"The Arctic is only referred to in passing and the fact that in March, Canada prevented Sweden, Finland, Iceland and the indigenous peoples from taking part in an international meeting on the Arctic in a rather unfriendly way is completely overlooked."
"I am embarrassed that the problem of the tar sands, the bluefin tuna and the ban on seal culling are not addressed."
"This is not all about provoking Canada. However, if we hold a serious discussion with a friend, it is foolish and shameful not to mention the problems that we have."
"No mention is made of the fact that Canada did not play a particularly positive role in Copenhagen."
"The problem of the visa policy, specifically with regard to the Czech Republic and its Roma people, should be highlighted more clearly."
"We must work together in friendship, but we must not sweep the problems under the carpet, because that does not help anyone."
"Therefore, my group will seek to ensure when we vote that the problem of the tar sands and of the import of seal products is included in the resolution."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, as chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada, I warmly welcome this resolution, which is actually a first part of an EU-Canada Summit."
"As has been said, Canada is one of Europe's oldest partners, and strengthening our relations across the Atlantic has become a priority for both sides."
"Again, as the noble lady said in her opening remarks, discussions are progressing with Canada for a comprehensive, economic and trade agreement which hopefully will set the standard for future trade agreements between the EU and third countries."
"Parliament will have to approve these agreements, and I hope that the Commission will keep Members, especially the interparliamentary delegation and the International Trade Committee, fully informed and involved at each stage of these discussions."
"The resolution before us is one that I can fully support as it is concise and sticks to the issues of the summit and our relations with the Canadian Government."
"The resolution sets a positive tone for future discussions and illustrates this Parliament's willingness to engage positively with our oldest trading partner."
"It can be built upon to advance the reputation not only of this House, but also in future negotiations with other third countries."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Mr President, there has not been any assessment of the social, environmental and economic effects of an economic agreement between the European Union and Canada."
"The Canadian Union of Public Employees, with 600 000 members in areas such as health care, education, local municipalities, public utilities and transport, is seriously concerned about the effects of such an agreement."
"The National Union of Public and General Employees, with 340 000 members in Canada in the public and private sectors, is equally concerned, as is the Public Service Alliance of Canada, with 165 000 members."
"These workers are concerned because they understand that such an agreement will be implemented primarily in the economic interests of big business in both Canada and in the European Union and not primarily in the interests of working people or of social justice."
"Now, both the European and Canadian transnational corporations want to break into the provision of public services in Canada - on a maximisation-of-profit basis, of course."
"They see an EU-Canada agreement as a vehicle to force extensive privatisation in areas like public transport, water provision and electricity."
"Such a development would be ominous for Canadian workers' pay and conditions."
"It could be the beginning of a race to the bottom in exactly the same way as we have seen in Europe, where the EU Commission itself endorses the rights of private companies providing services to exploit workers, as proven when the Commission took the Luxembourg state to court for wanting migrant service workers to be given the same protection as Luxembourgish workers."
"Now, Canadian water is a particular target of the water multinationals."
"Some EU-based multinationals previously wreaked havoc in countries such as Bolivia with water privatisation and their baleful influence is already being felt in Canada."
"Happily, ordinary people in Canada are prepared to fight to protect their public water provision."
"They will need to be vigilant."
"The European public sector workers' trade unions are also concerned, and I call on both Canadian and EU-based unions to forge a real campaign to protect public ownership in public services with democratic control rather than maximisation of private profit, but not just a coming together at leadership level but a real involvement of the rank and file to protect their public services."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, Europe and Canada have enjoyed a good partnership for many years, so it is only natural for us to seek to expand free trade."
"Is the present method the best one, however, in view of the time that the negotiations have taken?"
"Is the EU apparatus too cumbersome and bureaucratic to deal with this task?"
"Canada would like a free trade agreement with the EU, but at the same time, Canada refuses to ban the terrible method used to slaughter seals that runs absolutely counter to all rules on animal welfare."
"Similarly, Canada wants the right to tax shipping through an ice-free Northwest Passage."
"A route north of America must be freely available to all, however."
"The Northwest Passage is an ideal way to save time, money and fuel and benefit the environment."
"It improves the competitiveness of all the countries of the northern hemisphere."
"I therefore urge Canada to pursue the ideas behind the free trade agreement and drop any ideas of taxing use of the open sea."
"(DE) Mr President, as if it were not embarrassing enough that information has leaked out in the middle of the negotiations on the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (CETA), the accusation has also been made that Canada is being forced to adapt its copyright laws to US and EU standards as part of the CETA and the anti counterfeit trade agreement (ACTA)."
"It seems that the CETA refers to significant privatisation, deregulation and restructuring."
"This involves local authorities being prevented from applying specific local or ethnic procurement guidelines."
"Of course, it makes sense to put larger contracts out to tender and, of course, there must be rules in place to ensure that corruption and nepotism do not become rife."
"When our local authorities here are already complaining that they are not allowed to use companies that show social commitment, but instead are generally forced to give contracts to the firms that dominate the market, it becomes even more incomprehensible that we are imposing similar regulations on other countries."
"When free trade agreements allow multinational companies to sue governments for damages because of their decisions on environmental and health policy, it is clear that the European Union has learnt far too little from the financial and economic crisis and is continuing on the wrong, neoliberal course."
"If the EU really wants to be there for its citizens, as the soapbox speakers always say, then it must stop going down the wrong road and turn itself into a bulwark against globalisation, while supporting friendly powers such as Canada."
"(RO) I would like, first of all, as other fellow Members have also done, to emphasise that the EU-Canada Summit is an important opportunity for deepening our partnership with this important democracy."
"This relationship is extremely important to the EU as it involves partners who share the same values and have worked together over a long period of time."
"At the same time, I would like to remind you of the declaration made at the previous EU-Canada Summit in Prague in May 2009, which reiterated the partners' common objective, and I quote, 'to enhance the free and secure movement of people between the EU and Canada, with a view to extending as soon as possible visa-free travel to Canada for all EU citizens'."
"One year on, we are obliged to note that we are far from achieving this objective."
"Currently, not only are Romanians and Bulgarians still subject to a compulsory visa requirement, but, as you are aware, visas were reintroduced for the Czech Republic last year."
"I think that we have here, first and foremost, a problem of reciprocity."
"Given, as you are well aware, that all EU Member States have waived visas for Canadian citizens, in accordance with our legislation, we have, on the other hand, if I may say so, a problem of consistency as Canada has removed the visa requirement for one of the candidate countries, Croatia, while, I repeat, currently retaining visa requirements for citizens from EU Member States."
"I believe therefore that the May summit must make significant, if not decisive progress on the issue of waiving visas for all EU Member State citizens."
"I think that specific measures are required and this objective must be placed as high as possible on the agenda because we are no longer happy with declarations of principle."
"This form of discrimination is extremely unfair, especially for citizens in the country where I come from, a Member State of the European Union, which has made significant technical progress in terms of waiving visas."
"(DE) Mr President, I am wondering why I always feel that I should suspect the Commission of not wanting to put things before the European Parliament."
"That is the case with the free trade agreement which is being negotiated with Canada."
"I would like to join in the criticism voiced by fellow Members who have said that some of the facts are suspicious, in particular, the one mentioned by Mr Higgins, and I fully agree with him."
"In my opinion, trade agreements are a good thing if they promote general prosperity on both sides, but not when they serve the interests of a few large multinational companies almost exclusively."
"When you find out that health, education or public security have suddenly become the subject of trade agreements and that they are to be deregulated and privatised, then you begin to suspect that the agreement is for the benefit of the few and will cause harm to many others."
"I would like to send out a warning to the people who are attempting to bypass the European Parliament in introducing agreements of this kind."
"The second point that I would like to make is as follows."
"If you meet and negotiate with a long-term partner, such as Canada, you have to cover some unpleasant subjects."
"I believe that a discussion and an agreement of this kind should include the issue of the seal cull."
"This is not intended to annoy anyone, but to clarify the European position and to find a solution which would put an end to the appalling profit making at the expense of small animals."
"(RO) My fellow Member, Sebastian Bodu, was unable to make it to Strasbourg today and I am going to stand in for him."
"At the moment, 39 million European citizens from Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are unable to travel to Canada without a visa."
"More than half of this number - 22 million - are Romanians."
"Retaining the visa scheme for entry into Canada, as in the case of the United States scheme too, creates the situation where some Europeans are second-class citizens."
"European citizens' freedom of movement must be treated on a uniform basis."
"The visa issue affects the relationship between the European Union and Canada."
"President Barroso called at the previous summits for a resolution of this matter."
"This issue must continue to be raised."
"In the case of Romania, the proportion of rejected visa applications from Romanian citizens has dropped from 16% to 5% between 2004 and 2008."
"Roughly 200 000 Romanians live in Canada, the large majority of whom have entered there through the Canadian state's official immigration schemes."
"I do not understand why Canada takes different approaches."
"In 2009, visas were waived for a European country which is not a European Union Member State, the reason being given that a large number of citizens originating from that country were already living in Canada."
"I also believe that the Czech Republic must benefit again from the visa waiver."
"The reason given for reintroducing visas must not become a factor for the other states."
"The topic of visas has been entered on the agenda for the EU-Canada Summit by the European Parliament."
"The EU must maintain the stance taken in October 2009, which is to enforce the solidarity clause if the problem is not resolved by the end of 2010."
"Vice-President Ashton, achieving a visa waiver for Member States would be a major success for you in your job. I wish you every success in this endeavour."
"(EL) Mr President, Canada is one of the oldest and closest allies of the European Union and has been since 1959."
"However, our cooperation must always be based on common values and mutual respect."
"Canada is one of the ten worst emitters of greenhouse gases in the world and is the only country which, even though it signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol, then publicly announced that it had no intention of honouring its legal commitments."
"Instead of reducing emissions by 6% compared with 1990, emissions in Canada have risen by 26%."
"The production of tar sand is the main cause."
"Emissions of greenhouse gases from the production of tar sand are 3-5 times greater than from conventional production of oil and natural gas."
"The production of tar sand also takes two to five barrels of water for every barrel of tar extracted and then creates a series of waste products which threaten both biodiversity and the life of the natives."
"This production is also destroying the boreal forest, one of the biggest carbon sinks on the planet."
"By 2020, tar sand will probably have produced more emissions than Austria and Ireland."
"Canada spends just USD 77 per person on green subsidies, compared with USD 1 200 for Korea, 420 for Australia and 365 for the United States."
"Guaranteeing protection for the boreal forest is extremely important and it is important that we ask Canada to comply with the international agreements that we have jointly signed, but which only we are respecting unilaterally, and that should be the basis for any further cooperation."
"(SK) Since 1959, Canada has been one of the closest and most stable partners of the European Union."
"I am delighted that the economic situation has improved in Canada during the term of the current right-wing administration, which has not happened during previous electoral terms in this country."
"The strengthening economic situation and the stronger Canadian dollar, which are leading to greater prosperity for Canadian citizens, have also sent a positive signal to other countries, creating favourable conditions for the development not only of political but also of economic cooperation."
"I believe that the EU-Canada Summit in Brussels will bring concrete progress in negotiations over a complex agreement on economic partnership."
"Canada is the eleventh largest trading partner of the EU, accounting for up to 1.7% of overall foreign trade of the Union, and the EU is the second largest investor in Canada, while Canada is the fourth largest investor in the EU."
"In 2008, the total volume of goods reached almost EUR 50 billion, while services accounted for EUR 20.8 billion."
"The liberalisation of trade in goods and services between the EU and Canada, along with greater access to markets, will make it possible to invigorate and deepen bilateral trade, which will certainly bring significant benefits to both the EU and the Canadian economies."
"(CS) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the common visa policy of the EU now faces a major challenge in the form of the visa requirement imposed by Canada for the past 10 months on citizens of the Czech Republic."
"Canada, through its unilateral measure in relation to the Czech Republic, has also quite unacceptably bypassed the EU bodies responsible for the common visa policy."
"The rights of citizens of a Member State, as well as the prestige of the EU institutions which uphold these rights, have thus come under threat."
"The unprecedented action of the Canadian Government towards a Member State of the Union confronts the entire EU with a test of solidarity."
"Czech citizens are relying on the European Commission resolutely to take on the role of defender and representative of a Member State and its legitimate interests."
"There will be a unique opportunity for this at the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit, where the visa question should be among the points of discussion."
"It is high time that all possible steps were taken to achieve a breakthrough in this long drawn-out affair."
"I applauded the fact that the Commission, in October 2009, adopted a report in which it called on Canada to open a visa office in Prague and to establish a timetable for lifting the visa requirement."
"Canada has fulfilled the first requirement but not yet the second, and therefore neither the European Commission nor the Council should be satisfied with progress to date."
"The pressure on Canada should not be relieved, but, on the contrary, should rather be increased."
"In this context, I would like to call on the Commission to make a clear statement regarding its commitment to propose, in case of insufficient progress, countermeasures involving the introduction of a visa requirement for Canadian officials and diplomats."
"I firmly believe that we must stop dragging our feet."
"Czech citizens do not expect fine promises and sympathetic noises from EU bodies, but concrete, goal-orientated actions."
"In my opinion, the ball is now in the hands of the Commission and especially President Barroso, who will be the main negotiating partner of the Canadian premier at the summit."
"If we fail to start acting self-confidently and forcefully towards the Canadian Government, any efforts we make will lose effect and the result will be that the faith of Czech citizens in European institutions will be seriously undermined. Our talk of European solidarity will then be so much hot air to them."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the EU delegation for relations with Canada, I would like to emphasise the fact that Canada and the EU share common values."
"Our common values form the basis for the structure of our society and are of fundamental importance in this respect."
"We should make increasing use of this common foundation to take joint responsibility for restructuring basic global conditions."
"Our close historic and cultural links and our respect for multilateralism, including our support for the Charter of the United Nations, form the foundation of our partnership."
"We must improve and strengthen our relationship on a variety of levels, in particular, of course, on the political level."
"The agreement that we are discussing today will be the first based on the new treaty and the Commission should be aware of this."
"The main requirements for a successful decision-making process for this agreement are transparency, cooperation and the inclusion of Parliament."
"Two important subjects have been raised in this discussion."
"The one-sided visa rules for Czech citizens are unacceptable and should be abolished."
"Canada's criticism of the strict regulations on the sale of seal products is an indication not that we need to change, but that Canada must change."
"However, one of the objectives of the EU-Canada agreement is that we should work together to create a stronger trade area than the North American free trade agreement (NAFTA) area."
"This is not just about economic cooperation, but also about sending out a clear signal that protectionism is not acceptable."
"It is a lucky coincidence that Joe Biden is speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels on the same day as the EU-Canada Summit is taking place, because effective, professional cooperation with both parts of the North American continent is important to us and because together, we want to take more responsibility in the world."
"(CS) Baroness Ashton, I would like to point out to you that the Achilles heel regarding successful ratification of the agreement between the EU and Canada is the unilateral visa requirement for the Czech Republic, Romania and Bulgaria, because it creates an unacceptable form of second class citizenship in the EU."
"Not just the other countries showing solidarity with us, but also many MEPs will be perfectly entitled to block ratification if Canada fails to fulfil the promise to tighten its lax asylum policy, which is supposed to be the precondition for lifting visa requirements."
"Baroness Ashton, can you tell me whether you have pointed out to Canada that it is not acceptable for the country to postpone until 2013 the tightening of this generous asylum act which is open to abuse, and that it must amend the act as soon as possible, bearing in mind the shared values and good economic relations it has with the European Union, the terms of which are to be contained in the new trade agreement?"
"Madam Vice-President, do you consider it your priority to raise the question of bringing forward this deadline at the summit with Canada in two weeks' time, and to get the visa requirement lifted before signing the agreement with Canada?"
"If this is not the case, are you aware of the possibility that this important agreement may not be ratified here in the European Parliament, because we do not intend to accept this behaviour on the part of Canada towards the three Member States of the EU?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you on behalf of millions of citizens for your solidarity, and to applaud the fact that the draft of your joint resolution, which we will vote on in Brussels, includes a clear call for the amendment of the Canadian asylum system and the quickest possible lifting of the visa requirement for almost 50 million European citizens."
"(IT) Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the discussion and the debate in this Chamber lend great strength to its actions with a view to the May summit."
"There is no doubt about the ideas that everyone has expressed: the importance of our relationship with Canada, the importance of the partnership and our shared values with a great democratic country with which we have a strategic need to cooperate."
"However, some questions have been raised which, in my opinion, and on the basis of your mandate from this House, are questions which absolutely must be dealt with and, if possible, resolved, because it is the solutions that count at the end of the day, not the battles."
"The first of these concerns the need to stress the principle of reciprocity regarding the free movement of Canadian and European citizens."
"I am neither Czech, nor Romanian, nor Bulgarian, and other Romanian colleagues have spoken before me, but, all the same, as a European citizen, I feel just as cheated of my rights if European citizens cannot move freely around Canada - I am talking quickly, because you understand me, Mr President, but I think you would like me to repeat it for the translation - but, all the same, I feel cheated if other citizens from other European countries cannot move freely around Canada, while Canadian citizens can move freely around all the European countries."
"Moving onto the issue of the seal massacre: we are always moved when television programmes or press enquiries show the vicious, terrible actions used in certain hunting pursuits: in this Parliament, we have the chance to voice our opinions, and I believe that we should stop feeling upset and protesting and start taking action."
"Our relationship with a great democratic country such as Canada should also allow us to bring up problems and to request moratoriums."
"I thank Baroness Ashton for the action she will take and report back to this Parliament, beginning with the summit in May."
"(CS) Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit, I would like to mention one of the fundamental principles on which the EU is based."
"This is the principle of solidarity. This value must be respected in all circumstances if the EU wants to retain the trust of its citizens, even in cases which involve a problem for just one Member State."
"As has already been said, in July 2009, Canada introduced a visa requirement for citizens of the Czech Republic."
"At the request of the Czech Republic, the question of visa relations with Canada was included as an item at the February meeting of the Council of Justice and Internal Affairs."
"Solidarity with the Czech Republic was expressed at the meeting by Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia, and also in clear terms by the Spanish Presidency."
"The Commission also proclaimed solidarity, although there is no concrete solution in sight, even after negotiations between the groups of experts."
"Time moves on, and it is decidedly not working in favour of the EU and its citizens."
"For EU citizens from the Czech Republic, waiting for a new Canadian asylum act to be passed as a condition for lifting the visa requirement, with the closest realistic deadline in 2013, is hard to swallow."
"In this context, they are therefore expecting real help from the EU."
"If we often talk of citizens having a crisis of confidence in European institutions, let us also seek reasons for it in an approach, which, unfortunately, has not been one of complete solidarity so far."
"Mr President, I hope the High Representative will congratulate the Canadians on their diplomatic skills because they have something to teach us."
"At the recent conference on the trade in endangered species (CITES), they teamed up with their Japanese allies to comprehensively defeat our attempt to introduce a trade ban on bluefin tuna."
"That CITES conference was all too reminiscent of the one on climate change in Copenhagen, where the EU position was unclear."
"We seemed to have spent a lot of time debating amongst ourselves, rather than debating with others, on a day-by-day basis and we ended up being soundly thrashed."
"Japan and its Canadian allies had spent months beforehand doing the rounds, winning friends and buying a bit of influence here and there in order to get the votes they needed to get the result they wanted."
"We ended up coming out looking incoherent, disorganised and weak."
"The Environment Commissioner has said that this must never happen again."
"He is determined to make a change."
"However, we have conferences of this kind taking place across the world all the time and we need to ensure that we are harnessing the full diplomatic skills of the European Union to ensure we have a forward-looking strategy, that we use our resources effectively, and that we stop punching below our weight."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to highlight a very serious problem in enforcing intellectual property rights in these negotiations."
"Critical comments from Canadian professors of law and also from Harvard indicate that the planned agreement could amount to a complete revision of Canadian copyright, patent and trademark law."
"On the one hand, the Canadians feel that their sovereignty and their right to make use of their own intellectual property are being restricted."
"However, on the other hand, strict and precise rules governing copy protection and the extension of this protection to cover films are very, very important."
"It seems to me particularly crucial to include the Internet in any discussions on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, because it is impossible to protect intellectual property on the Internet without cross-border agreements."
"I am in favour of a specific ban on recording with video cameras in cinemas."
"This should be enforced in Canada."
"However, it is important for us to find a middle way."
"We should support the protection of intellectual property, but oppose blanket surveillance and persecution on the Internet."
"Of course, it is also important to take into account that Canada has a different legal tradition and a different legal system."
"This is a very difficult problem to solve, but I hope that we can find an effective solution."
"(DE) Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, our most important concern should be to provide support for small and medium-sized businesses, particularly during an economic crisis."
"These companies employ two-thirds of all workers and generate 80% of tax income."
"For this reason, it is essential for public tenders to focus on giving small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to be awarded public contracts."
"Of course, the technical regulations, in other words, the trade facilitation measures, must also be adequately taken into consideration in this agreement."
"What I would like to know is whether there is an agreement with the World Trade Organisation to incorporate the basic principles of the Doha negotiations into this free trade agreement."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, air transport is vital for bringing the European Union and Canada closer to each other by facilitating the transportation of goods and persons."
"The EU-Canada air transport agreement, signed on 18 December 2009, and the agreement on civil aviation safety between the European Union and Canada, signed in Prague on 6 May 2009, are two important elements in the transatlantic dialogue between the European Union and Canada."
"The first agreement is enforced provisionally until its entry into force after its ratification."
"The Council has not yet received any notification in this regard."
"The second agreement is not enforced provisionally."
"The Council must send the proposal for a Council decision and the text of the agreement to the European Parliament for its opinion."
"Bearing in mind the importance of air transport in the cooperation between the European Union and Canada, I would like to ask you, Vice-President, when the two agreements between the European Union and Canada will be able to enter into force properly."
"Mr President, Canada is a close ally, but the EU must be a critical friend where necessary."
"Canada's record on climate change is poor and Canada was obstructive during the Copenhagen negotiations."
"Of particular concern is the tar sands industry, as Mr Arsenis mentioned."
"Extracting oil from tar sands requires much more energy than oil produced from other sources, as well as being very polluting for the local environment."
"Given that the Canadian Government is currently trying hard to get the Commission to weaken its approach to carbon measurement in the implementation of the Fuel Quality Directive, may I ask the High Representative whether she will be raising the issue of tar sands in the summit discussions?"
"Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. - Mr President, this has been an extremely useful and valuable debate for the preparations for the summit."
"Honourable Members have covered a wide range of different topics and I shall not least be making sure that the two presidents - the President of the Commission and the President of the Council - who, of course, will be leading the European Union at the summit, are fully aware of the issues that have been raised."
"I am very grateful for the helpful way in which Members of Parliament have given me information, and put questions on areas I have to confess I do not know very much about - for example, on air transport, which I will have to find out about for them."
"I would like just to pick up on two or three of the key areas that were discussed."
"In the context, there seemed to be a general view among honourable Members that this is an important relationship."
"Perhaps some of the frustrations I felt in the Chamber were because we recognise the importance of Canada and the importance of the shared values that we hold."
"The frustration of those honourable Members from the countries particularly affected by the visa question is therefore completely understandable."
"Let me begin with trade, because quite a lot of the different contributions focused on that."
"We are right to go for an ambitious trade agreement."
"This will not be easy and from the very beginning - and I actually launched the trade negotiations - we recognised that, because of the particular interests of the EU and Canada, this was never going to be an easy negotiation."
"However, we should be very ambitious on both sides."
"One example is intellectual property rights, where I am very concerned that Canada needs to make sure it has a proper regime in place."
"I know that it is looking at that and that the discussions and the rounds so far have been extremely positive and constructive and things are moving at a good pace."
"I agree that we need to keep the Committee on International Trade fully informed and, as Mr Bradbourn said, those with a particular interest in Canada also need to be clearly in the loop on that."
"There will be an impact assessment, which is already being worked on at the present time, and, of course, Parliament will play its role in giving assent or not to the agreement when it is finally put forward."
"There is a very clear and key role for Parliament there."
"All I would add to that are two things."
"One is that a good trade agreement actually benefits our citizens."
"That is what it is for."
"It is to make sure that for consumers, there are greater choices and for workers, there are greater opportunities."
"We need to ensure that all our trade agreements provide genuine opportunities across the European Union."
"On the point on small and medium-sized enterprises, which I agree is very significant, I am reminded that one of the statistics that always struck me as being very interesting is that only 8% of our small and medium-sized enterprises actually trade, and only 3% trade outside of the European Union."
"I have always felt, and continue to do so, that if we were able to increase those figures and provide opportunities - and government procurement may indeed be one of the areas where that is a possibility - then that is an opportunity in both directions for our small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit."
"A number of honourable Members talked about the Arctic, and we have had discussions about that in recent times in Parliament."
"I accept that this is a very important issue, not least because it links to the other important issue I wanted to raise before I mention visas, which is climate change."
"As far as we are concerned, Canada did belong to the group of countries that, in the Copenhagen negotiations, did not, in our view, take us anywhere near far enough."
"We can debate Copenhagen further - and no doubt in other conversations with the Commissioner responsible, there will be opportunities to do so."
"We were interested that, in the Speech from the Throne on 3 March, the Canadian Government stated that it fully supports the Copenhagen climate change accord."
"That is significant, and what we want to do in the context of the summit is to encourage and urge Canada to be ambitious, notably in increasing its mitigation target for 2020."
"The international carbon market is key in shifting investment towards a low-carbon economy, and part of what we are able to do in our bilateral relationship is to push forward on those strategic questions of investment, of green technology and of collaboration, in trying to support all the measures we need to take to mitigate the problems of climate change."
"The final issue - and there were many, but I just want to pick on three - and one which I, of course, wanted to raise, is the whole question of visas."
"This is extremely important and, as Member States represented here through their MEPs have mentioned, there are three Member States who are actually affected."
"There is a lot of work going on to try and resolve this matter."
"We have had a lot of dialogue with Canada, a lot of the issues are well known and there are issues for Canada to resolve in terms of the legislation that it needs to put in place for the future."
"Honourable Members were quite right to raise this question and it will be part of the discussions."
"The second expert working group meeting took place in Prague to look at the issues particularly relevant to the Czech Republic, and that has been facilitated by the Commission, so the Commission is fully involved."
"I did pick up on, and will take away from this debate, the frustration of honourable Members who have raised the need to work quicker and further to address this problem and to recognise what is absolutely the most significant point of this, which is that this is not a bilateral issue, but a European Union-Canada issue, and we need to address it as such."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in May."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the moment, 39 million European citizens from Romania, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria are unable to travel to Canada without a visa."
"More than half of this number, 22 million, are Romanians."
"Retaining the visa scheme for entry into Canada for some of us is an untenable situation as it creates two classes of European citizens."
"European citizens' freedom of movement must be treated on a common, uniform basis, while the visa issue concerns the relationship between the EU and Canada and not bilateral relations between Canada and the respective states."
"In the case of Romania, the proportion of rejected visa applications from Romanian citizens has dropped from 16% to 5% between 2004 and 2008."
"Roughly 200 000 Romanians live in Canada, some of whom have entered there through official Canadian immigration schemes."
"This is one of the reasons for a large number of visa applications."
"The topic of visas was entered on the agenda for the EU-Canada Summit by the European Parliament."
"The EU's stance must be to apply the solidarity clause if the issue is not resolved by the end of 2010."
"The waiver of visas for Member States would be a first achievement for the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"I think that one of the priority issues on the agenda for the EU-Canada Summit, scheduled to take place in Brussels on 5 May, must be to waive visas for all European Union citizens, on the basis of reciprocity and in order to eliminate the current discrimination preventing Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens from visiting Canada without a visa."
"This situation is all the stranger considering that, last year, the Canadian authorities removed the compulsory requirement to apply for short-stay visas for citizens of Croatia, a country still negotiating its accession to the EU."
"Romania has made significant progress in the last few years, including with regard to certain important criteria for removing the visa scheme."
"The rate of rejection of visa applications, the rate of exceeding the legal residence period and the number of asylum applications are in steady decline."
"This is why the visa waiver would reflect this development, not to mention that equal treatment given to European and Canadian citizens would help strengthen mutual trust."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"Î¤he next item is Question Time (B7-0207/2010/rev. 1)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one:"
"Subject: Creation of a European credit rating authority"
"Does the Commission intend to propose the creation of a European credit rating authority for the Member States of the eurozone and/or their credit institutions?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Papastamkos for this question on a subject which, in my current capacity, I consider absolutely essential to the proper functioning of the economy and the financial markets."
"Credit rating agencies play a crucial role in assessing the risks associated with the situation of companies and also, for that matter, of the Member States, and the crisis has shown - and this is putting it mildly - that their method of operating has posed and continues to pose problems, with very serious consequences at times."
"That is why the G20 quite rightly took tough decisions to put in place supervision and new rules of governance."
"I wish to remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that at the time of the crisis, the Commission very quickly assumed its responsibilities in this regard, prioritising the regulation of the activities of credit rating agencies over the last two years."
"In September 2009 - in other words, one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers - the regulation on credit rating agencies was adopted with Parliament's support;"
"I would like to pay particular tribute to the work of your rapporteur, Mr GauzÃ¨s, to address the problems caused by these agencies' operating methods, which contributed significantly to the financial crisis."
"The regulation of which I speak introduced a system of compulsory registration for all credit rating agencies established on European Union territory."
"It imposed a set of stringent requirements: firstly, to ensure that possible conflicts of interest are brought to an end; secondly, to review and improve the quality of ratings and the methodology used; and, finally, to ensure that these rating agencies operate in a transparent way."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that the new rules on credit rating agencies about which I have just been speaking will definitely improve the independence and integrity of the rating process, will make credit-rating activities more transparent, and will improve the quality of such ratings, including those relating to the sovereign debt of the Member States - the countries of the European Union - and of the EU's financial institutions."
"That is the stage we are at."
"Mr Papastamkos, as regards the creation of a European public credit rating agency such as the one for which you are calling, it is an idea that is becoming part of the debate on possible alternatives to the credit rating agencies' current economic model, which is known as an 'issuer pays' model."
"The effects of such an idea must be carefully evaluated, particularly in terms of responsibility."
"Clearly, Mr Papastamkos, my first priority today is to ensure that the 2009 regulation is properly implemented and to make the current, reformed system work."
"However, I am not ruling out this idea that you support of creating a European agency."
"It must be considered in the light of the evaluation of the 2009 regulation and of its effects on credit rating agencies."
"Moreover, this evaluation is provided for in the regulation, and the Commission must submit it to Parliament and the Council between now and December 2012."
"What I can confirm is that the Commission will soon be proposing an amendment to the regulation on credit rating agencies in order to entrust the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) with overall responsibility for supervising these agencies."
"You in Parliament requested this when the regulation was being negotiated, and the Heads of State or Government have reached agreement on this principle."
"We will, therefore, make this amendment."
"I am convinced that the transfer to the new authority for the supervision of credit rating agencies will strengthen and improve the regulatory framework that we in the European Union have at our disposal."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his reply and to say, Commissioner, that this is a subject on which I have repeatedly exercised parliamentary scrutiny since back in 2006, in other words, before the international economic crisis broke."
"In my opinion, there are two paradoxes: there are international rating firms, but they are not subject to international supervision."
"The second paradox is that private schemes and interests outside Europe are acting high-handedly against European institutions and Member States."
"I should like - and I call, Commissioner - for Europe to move at a faster rate and with a quicker pace and, finally, I should like to know where the geographical seat is and how the turnover of these credit firms will be divided?"
"Mr President, Mr Papastamkos, I am aware of your long-standing commitment, and that is why I welcome this dialogue that you are opening between us for the first time today, because I personally have only been in post for a few weeks."
"I am taking account of this new regulation, which was proposed by the previous Commission, under Mr Barroso's authority, and which improves matters."
"I have mentioned the new requirements that will be imposed on credit rating agencies and I have spoken about the latest progress that will be made on the proposal that I shall put to you, in accordance with your wishes, for supervision by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)."
"You are right in what you say: this is not the only area in which, in a now highly integrated common and single market, we see that there are businesses, particularly financial businesses, that are no longer nationally owned."
"I would remind you, Mr Papastamkos, that in half the countries of our European Union, 50% of the banking industry belongs to groups from other countries."
"We are therefore in an integrated market with businesses that are largely transnational, but supervision has remained at national level."
"Our task, therefore, is to ensure integration, and that is what we are committed to doing."
"With the new powers being granted to ESMA, the international - European, let us say - supervision that you are calling for will be very much a reality."
"Now, as regards your country, which has suffered this shock, we must be very vigilant."
"I am not going to jump to conclusions about what happened."
"We must be vigilant in all cases in which credit rating agencies reach decisions on the Member States, and evaluate their economic situation and that of their public role."
"Why?"
"Because at stake here is, in fact, a sovereign state, the cost of its debt and, in the final analysis, the situation of its taxpayers, who I believe are too often made to bear the brunt of things."
"This, incidentally, was the subject of the proposals that I made to the Ecofin in Madrid on Saturday on foreseeing, preventing and managing future crises, so that taxpayers do not always have to bear the brunt of things."
"I am very aware of the effects of the decisions taken by credit rating agencies and of the effect that these decisions have on the behaviour of investors."
"That is why we need tough, demanding legislation, and these agencies must weigh up all their responsibilities and must be supervised in order to do so."
"They will be supervised by the European authorities under the proposals that I will be making at the end of this year."
"(DE) Mr President, thank you for the excellent report."
"It makes me feel quite optimistic that establishing the European credit rating authority will finally make us independent of private US agencies."
"However, what interests me in this context is not only the location, but also the functional and structural composition of this European credit rating authority."
"Ultimately, it is important for an organisation of this kind to have teeth."
"I am, of course, also interested in the expected consequences of the proceedings and in the consequences of a member of the euro area having a bad creditworthiness rating."
"Mr Obermayr, Mr Papastamkos asked me about the opportunity, which he supports, of creating a European credit rating agency."
"This agency, if I have understood his idea properly, should be public."
"I have not taken up a position on this subject."
"This is not, I might add, the direction in which the Commission was heading, since its proposal focused - through the regulation that this House adopted - on the reform of the current system of agencies, which are private, and on the very rigorous consolidation of the transparency requirements to avoid conflicts of interest, of honesty in their credit rating work."
"This is the stage we are at."
"This regulation is now on the table, it will enter into force as soon as possible, without delay - I mention this in passing - and we will then complete this plan by entrusting a supervisory role to the European Securities and Markets Authority."
"As regards this new agency that Mr Papastamkos so very much wants, I am not ruling it out."
"Nevertheless, we really need time to evaluate the change in business model which the idea of a European credit rating agency entails."
"It is an idea that I find interesting, but it must be carefully evaluated."
"I am not, therefore, going to say who would be part of it or how it would work, because I do not know."
"There would also be the question of the public authorities interfering in the work of such an agency."
"The strict conditions applied to private credit rating agencies should also apply to a European public agency, in particular, the rules on conflicts of interest."
"These issues would arise if we moved towards the creation of a new European public agency."
"Frankly, in order to work on this matter seriously, without improvising, we would need, firstly, to take the time and the decisions necessary to implement the reformed system that you have adopted through this regulation, and, secondly, to take the time to seriously address every issue and, in particular, those that I have just mentioned."
"The rule is that, if the author is absent, the question lapses."
"However, given the exceptional circumstances of this plenary, what we shall do is I shall read out the names of the Members who are not present and they will receive a written reply to their questions."
"However, there will be no related debate in plenary."
"So, the members who are absent but will receive a written reply, in the order in which the questions were submitted, are Mr BalÄytis and Mrs MorkÅ«naitÄ-MikulÄnienÄ."
"Part two:"
"Subject: Consumer choice and smart phone technology"
"The increasing popularity of smart phones has created a new market in terms of technology, software and applications."
"Certain smart phone and device service providers trap consumers and have organised the market in such a way that they completely control users' experience in terms of their access to software, navigating programmes and applications."
"It would appear that, under these circumstances, consumer choice is limited."
"Does the Commission intend to safeguard consumer rights and choice in this growing digital market and can it tell us if open operating systems will offer a way out for smart phone consumers?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission is closely monitoring the developments regarding smart phones and related markets."
"As the honourable Member recognises in his question, in some instances, new markets are being created."
"The Commission is fully committed to ensuring that general EU rules and principles relating to competition are respected, while taking account of the dynamic and fast-changing circumstances in the market."
"As recent cases such as Microsoft and Intel have shown, the Commission will take enforcement action to ensure that competition on the merits allows, where necessary, consumers to choose between different alternatives and therefore benefit from technical developments and innovations."
"In that respect, while acknowledging that proprietary technology is at the heart of Europe's success in second- and third-generation mobile technologies, the Commission is, at the same time, aware of the excellent technical development driven by non-profit technologies."
"While we have to leave it up to the industry to decide the specific business model it wants to use and up to the market to choose the winner, the Commission emphasises the importance of interoperability in encouraging competition on the merits between technologies from different companies and helping prevent lock-in."
"In this context the Commission welcomes the use of openness specifications that may prevent the unfair transmission of dominant positions between neighbouring markets."
"Open platforms serve that purpose, allowing the creation of competitive markets on top of software systems."
"Can I thank the Commissioner for the reply."
"Just changing, slightly, there have been a number of news stories recently regarding the concept of content-based censorship which is occurring with this technology."
"Some applications have been refused by operators and software manufacturers due to their political content."
"What can the Commission do to ensure that there is increased competition in accessing information via new technologies and that the right to freedom of speech is not infringed upon?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I know that the points you refer to in your second question can create problems for competition on the market."
"We are closely monitoring this issue all the time but I cannot comment on particular investigations that are now ongoing or are being developed."
"However, I am fully aware that the questions that you raised and the concerns that you have presented to Parliament are real, and my role and that of the competition authority is to monitor the situation and to avoid a kind of dominant position with closure of the market, barriers for new entrants and, ultimately, problems for the consumers and users of these new technologies, who should benefit and not suffer from the development and improvement of technologies."
"(DE) Mr Barnier, in the first Roaming Regulation for data exchange and telephony, we established a must-carry obligation, which means that every operator in Europe must be able to reach every customer."
"Conflicts are now suddenly arising from the fact that operators are removing these services from the networks and are not prepared to provide the necessary support."
"Do you think it is necessary for the national regulatory bodies to take action in this case?"
"(DE) I welcome the fact that the Commission is dealing with this subject from a competition perspective."
"My question is: Has the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on similar cases and could these cases be cited in the context of this type of access restriction?"
"Are there any users of smart phones who have already attempted to take legal proceedings against their service providers?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - In relation to the question, I think we should combine, where appropriate, regulation and competition instruments."
"In terms of some of the aspects that were raised in the questions and in your intervention, competition instruments have been useful and shall continue to be useful, but I am not excluding that at any moment, the Commission, where appropriate, will use the regulatory powers that we have."
"We did this in the past and we can do it again in the future."
"I think the best solution is an adequate mix of competition and regulation, not as alternative instruments, but as complementary ones."
"And, regarding your question, excuse me, honourable Member, I am not a lawyer;"
"I do not know the least thing about the complaints of individual citizens before the courts."
"In any case, we receive some information and sometimes complaints, and every time that we need to react where we consider that the information we have received or the complaints that have been sent to the Commission deserve a reaction on our part - and you have seen our instrument - we do just that."
"As I said in my previous answer, in this area, in this question, with these problems, we are now dealing with some investigations but I cannot publicly confess because by nature, I have to be discreet."
"The next author, Mr Toussas, who is absent, and Mr Ziobro, will receive written replies, as explained earlier."
"Subject: Activity of credit rating agencies"
"The day after the harsh measures taken by the Greek Government were announced, the credit rating agency Moody's is threatening to downgrade the five biggest banks in Greece."
"According to the international credit rating agency, the rise in unemployment and the fall in disposable income may cause additional pressure on the Greek banking system, which is already facing lower profits and further depreciation of its assets."
"As announcements of this sort and the time at which they are made feed speculation, what comments does the Commission have on the situation in the Greek banking system?"
"What measures does it intend to take on the 'activity' of credit rating agencies?"
"Member of the Commission. - The financial crisis in Greece did not originate in the banking sector but in the public sector."
"Banking sector vulnerability has increased, however, due to the exposure of the banks to Greek government bonds and, more importantly, due to low economic growth prospects."
"The Commission, in making its own analysis of the Greek economy and financial system, takes into consideration multiple sources of information, including the credit agencies."
"In this context, the Commission is carefully monitoring implementation of the additional fiscal measures announced by the Greek authorities on 3 March 2010 and adopted by the Greek Parliament on 5 March 2010, with a view to achieving the 2010 budgetary targets."
"The Commission is closely monitoring developments in the Greek banking sector."
"Some 8% of the banks' assets are in the form of government bonds or loans, although the government and non-performing loans arising are not expected to top eight per cent in 2010 due to the weak economy."
"Furthermore, Greek banks are heavily dependent on the ECB refinancing operations for short-term funding being shut off from the international money markets."
"The Commission takes its responsibility to ensure macro-financial stability in the euro area and the EU as a whole."
"Indeed, banks in other EU countries are exposed to the Greek crisis mainly through their holdings of government debt, with France and Germany the most concerned."
"While these exposures are not very large in terms of GDP, they are likely to be more significant in terms of the balance sheets of individual banks."
"Meanwhile, about 10% of Greek banks' balance sheets is invested in southern and eastern Europe, implying another transmission channel."
"(EL) Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"Obviously, there are problems with the banks in Greece."
"There is the liquidity that has been produced by the Greek public sector which, unfortunately, is not moving towards the real economy; but what I should like to point out to you is that every time that Greece announces certain measures, certain forms of borrowing, these famous credit rating agencies come along and downgrade the credit rating of Greece and the Greek banks."
"This is a sad role."
"A debate was held earlier, and I have no wish to recycle it."
"These credit rating agencies, which are private US firms, are truly unreliable and I consider it unacceptable for the European Central Bank and the European institutions to consider them - even today - to be important."
"The question which arises, and the answers which were heard earlier, are this: alright, the issue may be regulated in 2013."
"Right now, can the European Union and the institutions stop taking account of these agencies' ratings?"
"Member of the Commission. - As I have just said, in its own analysis, the Commission is taking into account not only the credit rating agencies but also its own analyses."
"The European Commission is following events very closely in the public and in the banking sector in Greece, so we come to our own conclusions and make proposals to the Council on the basis of those conclusions."
"There is something else, of course, and that is the activity of the credit rating agencies."
"These are private companies, which are very influential with respect to the financial markets, but that, of course, is not the responsibility of the European Commission."
"(DA) Mr President, we are all very concerned about what we can do to relieve the problems arising from the financial crisis."
"Commissioner, I saw that in the media the other day, you suggested that, in future, the Member States should submit their draft budgets to the Commission before they are debated and adopted by the national parliaments."
"I would like you to give us more details as to how the Commission will, in future, be given opportunity to comment on the Member States' draft budgets before the national parliaments do so."
"It sounds extremely interesting."
"I would like to hear more about it."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your reply."
"I listened with a great deal of attention to the information which you gave us and how you explained the Commission's position."
"I am trying to reach a conclusion."
"If, at some point in the immediate future, another country in the euro area faces similar problems with credit rating agencies and market pressures, will we proceed along the same well-trodden path?"
"Will we adopt a 'wait and see' approach?"
"Will we assume that, with the approach that we have applied to date to the problem of Greece, we are dealing overall with structural problems in the euro area which may, at some point, be of concern to other Member States?"
"Member of the Commission. - Let me first of all recall that I am answering these questions in place of Commissioner Rehn, who is ill, so this is not my particular portfolio, but I can say, on the questions that have been raised with respect to the national budget that we discussed for the first time last week in the college, what measures should be taken for the future monitoring."
"That is, of course, one of the topics that will be addressed, but it is clear that at this moment, there is no decision on that yet."
"There has only been a debate to make sure that the matter is duly discussed in the college and the competent Commissioner will come with proposals shortly."
"Then you can, of course, discuss it with him directly."
"On the second question, there is no reason for the Commission to take a different stance vis-Ã -vis Greece and vis-Ã -vis whatever other Member State, so I hope these questions are not put to us any more; if they were put to us again, we would have exactly the same stance."
"Subject: EU broadband strategy"
"Can the Commission clarify what measures it intends to take in order to promote high-speed Internet access throughout the territory of the European Union, especially in rural areas?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - In a world that is moving fast into a new digital age, Europe needs to be prepared with the state of the art broadband infrastructure that will indeed drive the growth of tomorrow."
"The Council of March 2009 fixed an indicative target of achieving 100% coverage by 2013."
"The Europe 2020 strategy has taken the challenge one step further by setting the 2020 high-speed broadband targets as 30 megabits per second for all Europeans, including people living in rural regions, and as 100 megabits per second for 50% of households subscribing to the Internet."
"The Digital Agenda for Europe, which is one of the seven flagship initiatives under EU 2020, sets out a strategy to promote high-speed Internet in Europe and is scheduled for adoption not that long from now."
"The agenda will be followed by three documents on broadband: firstly, broadband communication, which details the implementation of the agenda with respect to broadband; secondly, the recommendation on new generation access (NGA), which aims to clarify the basis to encourage investment in high-speed Internet; and thirdly, the first radio spectrum policy programme, which will form the basis of the Commission's strategy to generate enough spectrum for wireless broadband."
"The actions to promote high-speed broadband in the Digital Agenda comprise not only the Commission commitment but also suggestions to the Member States."
"Those suggestions will bring into focus the development of national broadband strategies covering the promotion of private investment using town-planning rules, mapping of infrastructure and clearing of rights of way; and by doing that, the Member Sates can substantially cut investment costs and make them more viable."
"They will also focus on bridging the financial gap by fully using the available Structural Funds to fund high-speed broadband and, where there are no incentives for private funding, direct public financing."
"The Commission, for its part, is looking at the options available to increase private and public investment in NGA to reach the agreed targets."
"Financial engineering will be among the considered options to reduce the gap between what is required and what the market is prepared to invest."
"deputising for the author. - Given the fact that we live in an increasingly digital world, as you have acknowledged, where so much of our daily business is carried out online, one group that, in my view, has been left behind are older citizens, who have limited or no access to the Internet."
"What can we do to ensure that they are not excluded from society, and what can we do to help them?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - It is not only the Commission but also the Council which took the wise decision, so to speak, to have an indicative target of achieving 100% coverage by 2013."
"100% is 100%, so whoever you are thinking of should be covered by the 100%."
"I very much welcome this question by Mr Crowley, and I am interested indeed that in Ireland, there is a new wireless broadband roll-out to provide first-generation access to rural communities, which I think is an exciting initiative."
"I wanted to ask you specifically about an issue that has come up in work I have done, which is on the State aid criteria for supporting local broadband initiatives."
"Some local authorities that I know have been trying to work with public authorities to consolidate demand together to give a viable package for an investor."
"But apparently, in some cases, this is considered to infringe State aid criteria."
"So could I ask if her services could support some of these community projects by giving some clear guidelines about State aid criteria to help those public/private partnerships which would, I agree, be crucial to achieving universal broadband."
"(RO) Commissioner, the Economic Recovery Plan provides a sum of EUR 1 billion to cover up to 100% of the broadband infrastructure."
"I would like to ask you what stage this project is at, bearing in mind the importance of establishing this infrastructure."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I am grateful for the first question because, indeed, when talking about broadband, it is not only about cable fibre, but also wireless, via satellite and so on. So, when I answer the honourable Member by saying that it is 100% coverage, I do not mention in which way the problem will be dealt with or solved."
"But I am quite positive about Ireland and their investment level."
"When there was the opportunity to spend structural funds, especially focusing on and investing in this type of issue, Ireland made the most of that opportunity."
"It was a bit under 50%."
"Compared with other Member States, I felt dismayed as sometimes it was a third, or even this opportunity was not taken."
"Investing in this type of infrastructure is really working for the future and the recovery of the economy and creating jobs."
"But, sometimes, I count my blessings and also my past experience."
"In my former portfolio, I had the privilege to review State aid rules."
"One of those reviewed State aid rules was connected with, for example, broadband."
"What we did with the review was to give more guidance as to how, when and in what way it could be dealt with."
"By the way, it is also investigating, with the European Investment Bank, possible ways to take advantage of their funds and support the funding of civil engineering."
"I think that, at the moment, with the recent review of the State aid rules, it is quite clear what is possible and what is not acceptable."
"You can always ask the staff of JoaquÃ­n Almunia to give you guidance, so do not hesitate when there is any uncertainty."
"All in all, we need to be aware that this is really public-private partnership that is making a big difference in this type of issue. Of course, it depends on the Member State and what is at stake, but all in all, I think that with the 100% coverage - and I am repeating myself - we are serving an excellent goal by talking about the 50%."
"I know what 100 megabytes are, but what can I imagine?"
"Well, a blink of an eye is less than 100 megabytes so we are talking about a tremendous step forward."
"So broadband measures and what concerns us in this debate is really scheduled to take place earlier than 2011."
"Subject: Great Britain, Sweden and the euro"
"How does the Commission evaluate the dangers to the EU as a single economic area from the fact that Member States such as Great Britain and Sweden have still not introduced the euro as their currency and what measures and initiatives are being planned for the new term of office of the Commission in this sector?"
"Member of the Commission. - The economic benefits of adopting the euro accrue to both the Member States that join the euro area and to the euro area as a whole."
"Detailed analysis and argumentation on this matter can be found, for example, in the Commission's EMU@10 report of 2008."
"Under the treaties, all EU Member States are obliged to join the euro area once they fulfil the necessary conditions."
"However, Denmark and the United Kingdom have negotiated an opt-out clause that allows them to remain outside the euro area."
"If Denmark and the United Kingdom decide to apply for membership of the euro area, they will be subject to the same convergence assessment as any other candidate, as happened with other Member States that have already joined the euro area."
"The Commission would support their preparations fully, including preparations for the actual cash changeover."
"Sweden does not have an opt-out clause."
"For the time being, Sweden does not fulfil all the criteria for introducing the euro."
"In particular, it is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism tool, and some elements of its central bank legislation would have to be made compatible with euro area membership."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that those Member States not currently in a position to fulfil all convergence criteria for joining the euro should strive to meet these conditions."
"(DE) Mr De Gucht, I just have two supplementary points to make."
"Firstly, will the Commission attempt to encourage Sweden to fulfil its obligations?"
"Sweden has an obligation under the treaties and this cannot just be interpreted arbitrarily."
"Secondly, what is happening about Estonia?"
"Do you think that Estonia will become a member in the foreseeable future, perhaps even this year?"
"Member of the Commission. - As I rightly mentioned, Sweden does not fulfil certain criteria."
"I mentioned the two criteria: it is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism, and some elements of its central bank legislation would have to be made compatible with euro area membership."
"It seems to me that these are, let us say, criteria which are possible to fulfil."
"They are not economic criteria with respect to debt or with respect to deficits."
"Whether or not the Commission will take action in that respect is a matter for you to put to the Commissioner who is competent for this, Mr Rehn, who unfortunately is ill at the moment."
"With respect to Estonia, as far as I know, this is still under reporting with respect to the convergence criteria and there is no definite stance of the Commission on this."
"Subject: Extending cuts to the private sector"
"On 4 March, your representative, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that cuts in the Greek public sector might well be followed by cuts in the private sector."
"From an economic point of view, any such development would exacerbate the recession by cutting domestic demand and internal consumption."
"The immediate impact of this cyclicity is a reduction in state revenue."
"I should like to ask the Commission where the optimism that disarming consumer power will guarantee Greece a way out of the recession comes from."
"I think that no one needs any particular knowledge of economics to say with certainty that limiting consumer power leads to even deeper recession."
"Member of the Commission. - Indicators reveal that over the last decade, there has been a disconnection between wage and productivity developments in Greece."
"This has generated competitiveness losses, reflected in persistent current account deficits and a fall in export market shares."
"Labour market rigidities and wage setting have been identified as an important factor behind the excessive wage growth in Greece and the resulting gap in unit labour costs with its main trading partners."
"In recent years, domestic demand has been the main contributor to economic growth, fuelled by buoyant growth in general government expenditure and household incomes."
"Private final consumption expenditure per capita increased by more than 80% over the last decade."
"This model has clearly been unsustainable, resulting in the build-up of significant fiscal, which means a high general government deficit and growth debt stock, increasing interest payments and macro-economic, which implies a high current account deficit and external debt outflow of income imbalances."
"The increased financing needs of the government have resulted in the public sector absorbing a large part of the available financing, thus ruling out the private sector and adversely affecting the economy's growth prospects."
"Economy-wide wage moderation, with public sector wage cuts playing an important signalling role to the private sector, and fiscal austerity measures are thus indispensable to put the Greek economy on a stronger footing by restoring competitiveness and achieving fiscal consolidation."
"The Commission is aware that fiscal austerity measures and wage moderation may have a negative short-term impact on demand."
"Nonetheless, given the current situation that Greece is facing, these measures are necessary to restore market confidence and to lay down the foundations for a more sustainable growth model for the Greek economy in the long term."
"Greece has adopted an ambitious programme to correct its deficit and to reform its public administration and the economy."
"The consolidation measures taken by Greece are important for enhancing fiscal sustainability and market confidence and have been strongly welcomed by the Commission, the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"The courageous measures included in the stability programme and the packages announced in February and March 2010 include not only the envisaged wage cuts through a reduction in allowances paid to civil servants and Easter, summer and Christmas bonuses, but also measures to improve the tax collection mechanism, widen the tax base and increase tax compliance."
"In the communication adopted on 9 March 2010, the Commission concluded that Greece is implementing the Council Decision of 16 February 2010 and that, based on available information, the fiscal measures announced by the Greek authorities on 3 March appear sufficient to safeguard the 2010 budgetary targets."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the National Statistical Service of Greece announced in its most recent - I think it was today's - announcement that unemployment in Greece has risen to 11.3%, of which nearly half (45%) are young people up to the age of 34."
"At the most productive ages, from 25-34, unemployment is 14.6%."
"I would also point out that this generation of young people in Greece receives extremely low wages, well below the European average."
"They are the EUR 700 generation, as they are called in Greece, and we are worried that wages will go even lower."
"So I think that we must be very careful when we make these generalisations, especially at such a difficult time for unemployment because, as you will understand, Greek society is worried."
"Do you think that, while there is such high unemployment and all these problems in Greece, we can get back to growth with new cuts and new redundancies?"
"Member of the Commission. - Of course, we are very much concerned by the unemployment in Greece, and not only in Greece but also in the rest of the European Union."
"On the other hand, it is also quite important that economic fundamentals are respected and when, over a certain period of time, wages go up faster than productivity, then you have a problem, and that is essentially what has happened in Greece."
"I realise that this is a massive problem, especially for young people, and we are actively monitoring the situation, but we are also of the opinion that long-term financial sustainability of a Member State of the European monetary union is essential."
"(EL) Mr President, my question is about the principle behind and reason for my fellow member's question."
"He said that Mr Rehn's representative suggested that cuts should be made in the private sector in Greece."
"The question, Commissioner, is this: with what right do Commission surveillance officials, Commission spokespersons and possibly Commissioners talk, suggest, forecast and exert pressure as to what Greece should do in sectors unrelated to Community policy, such as wages, pensions, public administration and health?"
"Who accredits these statements and where does the competence and jurisdiction come from to question, to pursue or to suggest such provision for the Greek economy?"
"Member of the Commission. - We are certainly not asking for employment in the private sector to be reduced, but we are seeing unemployment rise, not only in Greece but also in a larger part of the European Union as a result of the financial economic crisis."
"What we are saying is that we have to redress the Greek economy if we want the Greek economy to be sustainable over the longer term."
"We should also preserve the economic monetary union, which is of invaluable importance for the whole of the European economy: that is what we are saying; we are certainly not saying that unemployment should rise."
"Unfortunately, this is the result of policies that have been conducted over a certain period of time."
"Subject: Conflict of responsibilities of Member States and the EU in connection with IMF agreement(s)"
"In order to prevent a broader crisis, the Commission has provisionally amended the rules on State aid, by considerably simplifying the terms of eligibility of SMEs (European Economic Recovery Programme)."
"Hungary recently went through a very difficult financial crisis, as a result of its economic policy."
"On the basis of the EUR 20 billion agreed with the IMF, Hungary is obliged to come into conflict with values such as high levels of employment and protection for minority groups, values enshrined in the treaties which Hungary, as a Member State of the EU, considers to be of paramount importance."
"Can such an agreement be legal?"
"Who is responsible if, in a Member State of the EU, further to an agreement with an international organisation which has nothing to do with the European Union, the employment situation deteriorates drastically, including in respect of aid for the employment of people with disabilities?"
"Member of the Commission. - When the global financial crisis hit Hungary particularly hard in autumn 2008, the Commission and the Council decided very quickly to support Hungary with a major EU support package of up to EUR 6.5 billion, which exceeded half of the available funding for non-euro area Member States at the time and, together with the loans from the IMF and the World Bank, made a total of EUR 20 billion."
"I would like to stress that without this assistance, Hungary would have faced much larger disruptions to its economy than the 6% decline observed last year and the expected stabilisation this year."
"Moreover, given that the government had lost access to financial markets, no support would have meant that fiscal policy would have been even more restrictive than has been the case under the programme, and expenditure restraint would have been more severe."
"Thus, by limiting the magnitude of the recession, avoiding a sharper increase in unemployment and supporting the financing of the deficit, that international assistance has directly contributed to limiting the social consequences of the crisis, including among the vulnerable sections of society."
"Of course, in order for the economic programme to be credible, and to reassure investors that over time, Hungary would be back to sound public finances and sustainable growth, it was important that the government implemented an economic strategy that included financial consolidation measures."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity, Member States are responsible for the design and implementation of social policy measures."
"That being said, the assistance supported the actions of the government aimed at making budgetary savings and at better targeting expenditure and, in particular, at assisting poor and low income earners."
"Thank you for the answer."
"On behalf of Mr KÃ³sa, I would like to add a remark."
"After all, the reason why Hungary could not take advantage of the multi-billion euro stimulus offered by the European Economic Recovery Plan was precisely because rules such as these did not make possible a larger scale economic stimulus, and this went hand in hand with the further deterioration of employment."
"In particular, support for the employment of people with disabilities could not be realised, and so a strange contradiction arises here."
"I would ask for your opinion on this."
"Member of the Commission. - I am not responsible for this Commission file, but it would seem to me that the honourable Member is hinting at a EUR 100 billion package, but that it is a package that was financed by the Member States themselves, and which the Member States got the authorisation to put into practice."
"It was not money that was put at the disposal of the Member States."
"You will find the EUR 100 billion on the debit side of their national budgets."
"What has happened with Hungary, because it was necessary, is that additional aid of EUR 20 billion was put at the country's disposal, which is something that has not happened with the other economies."
"They have only been authorised to take measures so that they could overcome the crisis, but no actual disbursement has been made to those Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the reply which you gave does not, in my opinion, reflect the problem and speculation behind the question and, given the situation in Greece, I should like to ask you this: have you any concerns about the entry of the International Monetary Fund, an external organisation, into the internal affairs of the European Union?"
"Wherever the International Monetary Fund has been, it has - one might say - sown destruction."
"So the question is this: has the Commission any concerns as to why the International Monetary Fund has entered the European Union and in which treaty and in which article is provision made for the participation of the International Monetary Fund in the procedures of the European Union?"
"Why does it not opt for a European solution in the case of Greece, as provided for in Article 122(2) of the treaties?"
"Member of the Commission. - Very briefly, if the IMF were to intervene in Greece, that, of course, would be at the request of Greece."
"They do not intervene unilaterally and, as the honourable Member knows, there has been a European agreement among the Member States and the members of the economic and monetary union to have a joint effort of the Member States of the European Union and the IMF."
"But it is only at the request of a Member State, in this case Greece, that this will actually happen, and that is what I understand is presently being discussed."
"Subject: Budget deficit in Cyprus"
"The economic crisis has hit the entire world, including the countries in the eurozone."
"Does the Commission have any information on the budget deficit and other indicators of the Cypriot economy?"
"Are developments in the Cypriot economy and its indicators a cause for concern?"
"Do you consider that measures need to be taken in respect of the budget situation in Cyprus and, if so, what measures and for how long?"
"Has there been an exchange of views and have the positions and recommendations of the EU, by which I mean the Commission, been conveyed to the government of Cyprus?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me kindly ask you whether this debate could come to an end."
"I am replacing Mr Rehn, and normally Question Time stops at 8 o'clock."
"I have other engagements so I cannot stay."
"That is a real problem for me."
"I have no time and cannot stay."
"I travelled here with great difficulty from part of the European Union and I do not accept the response from the Commissioner that he has no time."
"If you have no time, walk out that door now."
"I am a Member of Parliament, I have a question down for answer here."
"I have a lot of engagements as well."
"I have sat here for a very long time waiting for my question while all sorts of supplementaries were answered."
"I should have the courtesy of a reply in this House."
"I think it is very arrogant of you to say you have no time."
"Member of the Commission. - It is up to the President to decide on this."
"Let it also be very clear that I am not at present answering questions that are put to me but am replacing Mr Rehn, who cannot be here because he is ill."
"You have to say that to the President."
"I respect the authority of the President in Parliament."
"It is not up to me."
"You are right to point out the problem."
"You are replacing Commissioner Rehn, which is unfortunate, of course, given the importance of the questions."
"Nevertheless, Question Time is scheduled until 8.30 on our agenda."
"Given the circumstances, whereas I cannot tie you down on that chair, I can tell you that what is expected is for you, having received the unfortunate role of replacing Commissioner Rehn, to do so in the full range of his questions."
"Member of the Commission. - I had understood it was until 8 p.m., but, as I have already said, you have the chair and it is up to you to decide what I should do, so I shall continue."
"The financial crisis which has also evolved into a macro-economic crisis has been the worst in post-Second World War history in terms of both magnitude and global coverage."
"The crisis took a heavy toll on the global economy, including the EU and the euro area countries."
"As such, it unavoidably affected Cyprus, a very small, open economy."
"According to provisional estimates released by the Cypriot Statistical Service, the gross domestic product of Cyprus appears to have contracted by 1.7% in real terms in 2009."
"This is the first time economic activity in Cyprus recorded a negative growth rate over the last 35 years."
"These unfavourable economic conditions, coupled with the fading-out of the asset boom and an expansionary fiscal policy partly due to measures adopted within the framework of the European Economic Recovery Plan, led to a deterioration of the public finances."
"According to the latest notification of GDP-related data from the Cypriot authorities transmitted in March 2010 and currently under validation by Eurostat, the general government balance reached a deficit of 6.1% of GDP and the general government gross debt attained 56.25% of GDP in 2009."
"The Stability and Growth Pact requires the Commission to prepare a report whenever an actual or planned deficit of a Member State exceeds 3% of GDP reference value."
"Currently, the Commission is in the process of preparing such a report for Cyprus."
"Once the report is ready, it will be presented to the Council, which should decide whether the deficit is excessive."
"If the Council concludes this is the case, it would make recommendations to Cyprus and would establish deadlines for effective corrective action to be taken."
"In the meantime, the Cypriot Government has also sent its updated stability programme."
"The programme spells out the medium-term budgetary strategy until 2013."
"Currently, the Commission is in the process of assessing the update and preparing its recommendation for a Council opinion on the programme."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, it would be extremely embarrassing if you did not give an answer right now to the question asked."
"Be that as it may, I should like you to tell me if Cyprus is in danger of being put under supervision and if you are satisfied with the convergence programme."
"Of course, you said something about estimates, but I should like to know if you are satisfied with the convergence programme tabled by the government."
"Member of the Commission. - Well, I can only repeat what I said, that there will be an assessment and this is the normal procedure that we apply to all Member States including Cyprus."
"If the Commission comes to the conclusion that this is an excessive deficit, then it will make recommendations to Cyprus."
"Subject: Greece and the current crisis in euro cooperation"
"Greece is revealing the other side of euro cooperation at the moment."
"In the good old days, the impression was that everything in the EU was peachy."
"However, as soon as the consequences of the financial crisis hit Europe, the situation deteriorated drastically."
"The Greek public deficit was 12.7% of GDP in 2009, well above the 3% ceiling permitted under the Stability Pact for countries in the eurozone."
"Athens is now forced to impose an austerity package which makes provision for cuts of EUR 4.8 billion to the national budget."
"The Greeks are being forced to tighten their belts and the austerity measures are hitting everyone indiscriminately, from civil servants to pensioners."
"Generally speaking, fluctuating exchange rates are not a good thing."
"They are of no benefit to anyone, nor do they resolve fundamental, structural problems."
"However, we are obliged to acknowledge that money, like everything else, has a price."
"The price of money in Greece is being felt in the form of massive interest rates which are freezing all forms of economic activity."
"When the situation becomes that drastic, a country needs to be able to apply the emergency brake and 'slash' the price of money."
"Does the Commission not agree with this and does it not therefore accept, by extension, the inherent weakness of the euro?"
"Member of the Commission. - The honourable Member seems to suggest that having an independent monetary policy in Greece would be a way of alleviating the crisis affecting the country."
"This is not correct; the high interest rates from the Greek Government are not due to monetary policy factors but rather to high risk premiums related to market concerns about debt sustainability."
"ECB interest rates are at a historical low and the Central European Bank has been providing very ample liquidity to the euro area financial system, including the Greek institutions."
"Of course, participation in the euro requires that economic adjustment of course via channels other than the exchange rate, as shown in many Commission documents, for example, the comprehensive 2008 report on EMU@10."
"Adjustment in the euro area has not been sufficiently smooth in the past."
"This is why the Commission has highlighted the need to reinforce EU multilateral surveillance procedures based on intensified peer pressure to identify and tackle vulnerabilities in Member States at an early stage."
"The Commission is currently preparing proposals to this end, as I already mentioned in reply to a previous question."
"(DA) A wealth of possibilities exist for regulating a country's currency - provided that country has its independence."
"However, that is precisely what members of the euro area do not have, because they dumped a great many of the instruments they used to have in Frankfurt."
"Moreover, it is not correct that interest rates do not differ within the euro area, for there is great variation in private interest rates for both medium- and long-term borrowing, and the Greek bond rate is much higher than the Danish bond rate, for example - despite the fact that we have our own currency."
"What I would like the Commission to give an answer to or concede here is whether it will face up to the fact that were Greece not bound by the position set out by Frankfurt, then Greece would have devalued, and this devaluation would have remedied a large part of the problems that Greece is facing."
"Member of the Commission. - Certainly not."
"The whole idea of a monetary union is of course - and everybody is perfectly aware when they become a member of the European monetary union - that you can no longer devalue your currency because you do not, in fact, have a currency any more."
"There is only the common currency."
"There is no longer such a thing as a Greek currency."
"The Greeks have the euro as their currency."
"So an individual devaluation is completely contradictory to the whole idea of a European monetary union, and it is not by accident that Greece is a member of the European monetary union."
"It is a member because they did everything - really everything - to get in."
"Subject: European Monetary Fund"
"The idea of a European Monetary fund was refloated over recent weeks as a mechanism for addressing crises like the crisis that hit Greece at the start of the year."
"What is the status of this proposal?"
"How could such a fund operate in practical terms?"
"What are the main obstacles to the creation of an EMF?"
"For example, is it feasible to create it on the basis of the provisions of the current treaty?"
"Member of the Commission. - The crisis has demonstrated the need for establishing a crisis resolution framework for the euro area."
"Due to the need to consider all economic, legal and institutional implications, this is an issue for the medium term rather than the immediate view."
"The Heads of State or Government of the euro area gave a strong signal on 25 March by calling for the establishment of a task force to work on measures for the euro area framework for crisis resolution before the end of the year."
"The public discussion regarding a European Monetary Fund has touched a number of elements that are relevant in this respect."
"In particular, the Commission agrees that there is a case for establishing a framework for emergency financial support under strict conditionality and subject to incentive-compatible interest rates."
"However, no new body is needed to provide it or to define and monitor conditionality."
"Consistency with the stability-oriented governance framework of the EMU needs to be ensured."
"The Commission is considering the scope of proposals to this effect."
"More generally, a firm commitment to sound policies by all euro area Member States remains the cornerstone of the successful functioning of the EMU."
"In this context, the Commission is in the process of preparing for the proposals on reinforced economic policy coordination and country surveillance building on the proposals presented in the recent Commission communication on Europe 2020 strategy."
"First of all, can I apologise to the Commissioner."
"We are all suffering a little bit of cabin fever because some of us have not been able to get home and are trying to help some of our families to move around the place."
"I realise that the Commissioner has other appointments and is substituting for a colleague."
"Could I ask the Commissioner, in relation to his reply, what would constitute the medium term?"
"Are we talking half-way through the lifetime of this Commission?"
"Are we talking a year, 18 months?"
"What sort of period does he see for some more definitive response in this issue to materialise?"
"Member of the Commission. - You should put the question on a specific timeframe to Commission Rehn, but when you look at the recommendations that we have been making and the agreement that has been made to support Greece, in particular, by a combination of bilateral loans and International Monetary Fund support, it is clear that the Commission is of the opinion that what happened now in any case could not be resolved by the putting into place of a European Monetary Fund because this would certainly take much more time than we have with respect to Greece."
"So this is a medium-term project that we are sympathetic with, but with respect to a specific timeframe, I really suggest you put the question to Mr Rehn."
"Subject: Financial monitoring procedures for the Member States"
"The Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Policy, Mr Olli Rehn, said that the key lesson of the crisis is that we urgently need broader and deeper monitoring of economic policies, including action to promptly identify and address imbalances, with a view to safeguarding macro-economic stability in the eurozone."
"Given that the Commission has the tools, under Articles 121 and 126 of the treaty, to monitor the Member States' financial policies and given that the majority of them have a deficit which well exceeds 3%, does the Commission intend to strengthen the preventive character of monitoring and, if so, using what means and procedures?"
"Does it intend to table proposals to strengthen economic convergence in the eurozone?"
"Does it intend to promote the necessary structural changes in the Member States so that they are already applied at a time when their public finances so permit?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission has long argued in favour of deepening and broadening euro area economic surveillance."
"The importance of this issue was recognised by the European Parliament in its report on the 2009 annual statement from the euro area and public finances."
"The Commission intends to make full use of the new treaty instruments to achieve stronger policy coordination and governance."
"A forthcoming communication will outline new proposals in order to frame the development of a comprehensive framework for crisis prevention and correction in the euro area through recourse to the new Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The communication may include proposals to reinforce the preventive and corrective arms of the Stability and Growth Pact - proposals for more effective and broader surveillance of intra-euro area macro-economic imbalances - and explore the options for the creation of a crisis resolution mechanism for euro area countries."
"Regarding fiscal policy, a reinforced emphasis on fiscal sustainability is warranted because of the impact of the crisis on debt and growth potential, as well as the demographic factors kicking in."
"The incentives for compliance with the preventive and corrective dimensions of the Stability and Growth Pact need to be made stronger."
"The commitment to consolidation needs to become stronger in good times."
"Underlying vulnerabilities of public finances should be taken properly into account when designing the optimal consolidation part."
"New focus should be given to debt dynamics and sustainability and quality of public finances, including national fiscal roots."
"There is also a need to address cases where the rules are continuously broken; penalties could be made more deterrent and incentives strengthened."
"Competitiveness developments and macro-economic imbalances, on top of fiscal imbalances, are a matter of concern for all EU Member States."
"However, surveillance of macro-economic imbalances and competitiveness diversions are particularly warranted for EU Member States that linked to the euro because of the higher degree of economic and financial spillovers across euro area Member States; less market discipline; the absence of exchange rate risks and more challenging adjustment with potentially high cost for the euro area as a whole."
"Competitiveness divergences are a cause of serious concern for the functioning of the European Monetary Union."
"During the decade preceding the crisis, divergence has been underpinned by a worrying build-up of a range of domestic economic imbalances in some Member States including, inter alia, high debt and housing bubbles in some current account deficit countries, as well as entrenched weakness in domestic demand in some surplus countries."
"Diverging wage and cost trends, the accumulation of a sustainable external debt position and the protracted mythical allocation of resources raised the stake for adjustment and increased vulnerability of public finances."
"At the same time, countries heavily relying on trade surpluses have fallen victim to the sharp contraction in world trade in the early stages of the global crisis."
"Therefore, complementing fiscal surveillance, the Commission intends coming forward with proposals for the broadening of economic surveillance in the euro area, addressing macro-economic imbalances and competitive developments."
"The aim is to set up a framework for early detection, prevention and effective correction of intra-euro area imbalances."
"The third main element in the Commission's proposal will explore the options for setting up a crisis resolution mechanism."
"The ad hoc mechanism for possible financial assistance for Greece serves the immediate need."
"However, it is necessary to set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism with strong built-in disincentives for activation."
"Establishing ex ante clear, credible and consistent rules and procedures for the provision of exceptional and conditional support for a euro area country in serious distress will bolster the fundaments of the EMU."
"The proposals for enhanced economic surveillance and coordination in the euro area are an important complement to the EU's comprehensive 2020 strategy for growth and jobs."
"The Commission will ensure the efficient articulation between the two frameworks."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply; allow me to come back to the subject of surveillance and imbalances."
"What I was hoping to learn from my question is whether divergence will now become a serious item on the agenda; not only financial imbalances, but economic divergence, and not only the surveillance mechanisms, but also action to address divergences."
"International crises, the Greek crisis, have brought all the weaknesses in the euro area to the surface."
"Member of the Commission. - First of all, I would also like to apologise to the interpreters but I am in a somewhat exceptional situation."
"You could also interpret that I tried to answer all the questions within the timeframe of 20.30."
"With respect to the additional question, I think you should go back to the origin of the crisis in your country, which is, in fact, that these imbalances have been created over time."
"There is a very big imbalance with respect to competitiveness."
"Wages went up much higher than did competitiveness and this is, of course, in the first instance, also a matter of national policies."
"Regarding whether it is better to have closer monitoring, the answer is yes."
"That is why we are proposing a new scheme for that."
"You should not forget that in 2002, the European Commission made a proposal that auditors could be sent to a Member State to check the numbers, for example, but it was not accepted by the Member States."
"So the Commission has always been aware that monitoring was a very important part of the national budgets being compatible with the European Monetary Union, especially in the case of Greece."
"All I can tell you is that Olli Rehn owes you a big one, apparently!"
"So you have something to negotiate with him next time there is a Question Time, perhaps when it is your turn to stand here."
"Establishment of a European Asylum Support Office (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Jean Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council position at first reading (16626/2/2009 - C7-0049/2010 - for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Asylum Support Office."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am not sure that inspiration is going to be what is on offer but this is obviously a very controversial topic that many Members in this House were terrified to come and speak about, so those of us who are brave enough to be here must seize the moment."
"I want to start firstly by thanking very much all the shadows who worked on this report for their very active involvement and our ability to find a common negotiating position and act as something of a team."
"I also want to thank the two Presidencies involved - the Czech and particularly the Swedish Presidency - for their more open attitude on this than we have seen in some negotiations, as we were able to negotiate rather than feel we were there to do what Council wanted - well, sometimes anyway."
"So, what did we achieve?"
"The aim of the common European asylum support system is to deliver consistent high-quality decision making for those in need of protection, and it really can be a matter of life or death for those in need."
"It is well known that the system is not delivered in a consistent way across Member States."
"Differences at times are so great between the best and the worst that there is a lack of confidence which can lead to those who try to deliver objective decisions feeling undermined by those who do not."
"And those who suffer at the end of the day are those in need of protection."
"There is also a very strong feeling from some Member States under particular pressure that there is a lack of solidarity from others, that their need for support is not given a real practical response."
"Under the refugee fund, there has been a funding strand for cooperation between Member States which has led to some positive developments, but it has also become clear that there are limits to this more piecemeal approach."
"The Asylum Support Office is therefore being set up to provide ongoing support to enhance a consistent approach and to provide active support for countries under particular pressure."
"Specific tasks are already being assigned to it via other legislation."
"The key points for the European Parliament during the negotiations have been the role of the European Parliament itself in relation to the Asylum Support Office, how to achieve greater solidarity between the Member States, and the role of civil society and UNHCR with the Office."
"The issues about the role of Parliament have centred around our relationship with the Director in terms of his or her appointment and ongoing links."
"We have eventually settled on the European Parliament hearing the recommended candidate, offering a confidential opinion and receiving feedback on how that is being taken into account."
"The Director will also present the annual report to the relevant committee - I cannot quite believe we had to fight for that, but still - and we can also invite the Director to report on the performance of certain tasks."
"The role of Parliament in relation to agencies is now a topic for discussion in the interinstitutional working group, and I am now a member of the European Parliament team on that - partly due to my experiences and a certain sense of frustration with the negotiations on the Asylum Support Office."
"As regards solidarity between the Member States, Parliament wanted binding mechanisms, Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation, and the final language is more neutral, but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to, which will cover the Support Office's impact on practical cooperation on asylum."
"On the role of the consultative forum, there is a lot of real expertise available to Member States, and it seemed obvious to us that such expertise could be valuable."
"We know that some Member States have active relationships with NGOs, and we wanted as well to make sure that local authorities, which often deliver much of what is required under the common system, also had an opportunity to be included."
"So we are pleased to have been able to breathe a little more life into this body."
"In conclusion, we feel that the Asylum Support Office could play a very valuable role in developing a common system."
"We hope it will be of high quality - even if we could not quite get that into the final text - and help engender a sense of mutual confidence and support."
"I would also ask the Member States involved to be more open to what other institutions, elected authorities and civil society can contribute, because, while this is about cooperation between Member States, it is not entirely intergovernmental."
"It is a European institution we are creating."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really happy that we are now very close to a final adoption of the regulation establishing the European Asylum Support Office."
"The Commission proposed this back in February 2009, and the Council and Parliament have been extremely committed to this."
"The establishment of a common asylum system has been an objective of the European Union for many years and the Commission and myself remain very committed to this objective."
"We must establish a system which is fair and efficient, based on common standards and common principles."
"This system should also be based on solidarity, and that means solidarity with the migrants, with the countries of origin and transit, and it also means solidarity between the Member States."
"In order to strengthen the solidarity between the Member States, practical cooperation between the different authorities in the area of asylum is important as a part of forming the European asylum system."
"To enhance this practical cooperation, the establishment of the Asylum Support Office was requested by the European Pact on Asylum and Migration of 2008 and agreed in the Stockholm Programme in 2009."
"The Support Office will therefore be a cornerstone in the building of a common asylum system."
"The Support Office will, as you all know, be located in Valletta."
"It will provide concrete and operational support to Member States' authorities, and will facilitate the development of the necessary cooperation between the Member States and the development of common practices."
"This will be achieved through training of individual persons dealing with asylum applications and through exchange of information and best practices."
"The Support Office will also provide assistance to Member States under particular pressure by sending expert teams which can help with the registration of asylum applications."
"I would very much like to thank the European Parliament and all the rapporteurs responsible for this - Mrs Jean Lambert, of course, for her work, as well as Mr Moraes for the necessary amendments to the European Refugee Fund, and all the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"Your full and constant support has been extremely valuable and I am looking forward to working with you on the final steps before this Office opens - hopefully very soon."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by congratulating Jean Lambert for her report and for the success of this dossier, as well as for the loyal manner in which she cooperated with us, the shadow rapporteurs, on the subject."
"The European Popular Party has a positive outlook on the establishment of the Asylum Support Agency because it considers it to be an important step forward in the establishment and implementation of a common asylum policy within the European Union."
"On a personal level, as a Maltese MEP, I am obviously not just satisfied but also proud that this Office is to be established in my country's capital city, Valletta."
"I would like to point out that this Office must recognise that a common asylum policy needs to be built upon one word, as has already been mentioned, and that is solidarity: solidarity towards asylum seekers travelling to Europe who are entitled to protection, which the said office must ensure, and, as rightly stated by the Commission, solidarity towards those countries who have been shouldering the burden alone, without any assistance."
"Therefore, this concept of solidarity must be understood in its entirety; indeed it is as though we are looking at two sides of the same coin, in showing solidarity to those who deserve protection and solidarity with those Member States carrying a disproportionate weight."
"I would like to say that, so far, it seems as though the message on the importance of solidarity has been understood."
"However, we have not yet taken it a step further."
"I would now like to see words being translated into facts, and to see this principle being activated on a practical level."
"This is where the Support Office will have a major role - to flesh out this principle, to implement it and to ensure that the specific initiatives it undertakes will indeed succeed in extending solidarity to all those who require it."
"Therefore, I hope that this Office will be up and running as soon as possible and I would like to assure others that we, as Members of Parliament, will be closely monitoring its operation method in the months and years to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to start by congratulating both Mrs Lambert and Mr Moraes on their excellent work, which will allow us in the next few days - as soon as the airspace situation has returned to normal - to formally adopt the regulation on the creation of the European Asylum Support Office."
"I imagine, therefore, that we will all agree on one point: that we welcome the imminent creation of this Office."
"Resolutely aimed at practical cooperation, the Office will help reduce the significant gaps that still exist between the asylum practices of the various Member States, and this despite a first, so-called harmonisation phase that began at the Tampere European Council."
"This body will allow us to ensure the consistency that is lacking in current practice."
"I also wish to stress the important role that civil society will play in this Office, through its participation in consultative forums."
"Civil society's grassroots involvement will provide a clearer insight into the difficulties encountered by asylum seekers, and into the failures of the national systems."
"However, we must recognise that this matter leaves a slightly bitter taste in the mouth."
"For Parliament, it is regret at not being able to play a full role in the appointment of the Director of the Office, for example, and for the Office itself, it is the impossibility of contributing to the introduction of a system of compulsory solidarity between Member States to provide relief for the countries located at the gates of the European Union."
"In practical terms, this voluntary solidarity is empty talk."
"The fact is, if we refuse to even mention a more binding system, how will we ever achieve it?"
"This remains a topical issue in our debates and we will continue to remind our partners, the Council and the Commission, of it."
"The creation of this Office perfectly illustrates the need to put in place a common European asylum system."
"All the Member States are very much in favour of this when it is a case of declarations such as the 2008 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum."
"Strangely, however, these same Member States seem to suffer memory lapses when it is case of shifting from words to actions and translating their commitments to common rules into texts."
"It is, for example, most regrettable to see how willingly the Council adopts a whole series of measures to combat illegal immigration, as it did during the February Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"However, it proves more cautious during the negotiations on the asylum package, which has been at a standstill for several months now."
"Rather than putting on a purely and opportunely political display achieved through repressive measures, I call on the Member States to build a real Europe of solidarity."
"On the one hand, we know that these repressive measures are a significant threat to the right of asylum in Europe for individuals who, because of the increase in screening and other barriers, are undertaking increasingly dangerous journeys."
"On the other hand, Europe could finally boast genuinely harmonised asylum procedures based on the granting of proper guarantees to asylum seekers."
"We can see that the Member States are very resistant to the asylum package and that the tendency is towards keeping national practices."
"This resistance is echoed resoundingly in arguments over the budgetary costs of such a common policy, which would seem to be unsustainable in a crisis context."
"Nevertheless, Europe has a huge responsibility where asylum is concerned."
"We should emphasise the fact that, to date, it is more often than not third countries that are less well-off than us that have played their part in accommodating refugees."
"Let us hope, therefore, that this asylum package is as successful as the Office was, and that its success comes quickly, because there is an urgent need to act."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is one of the European Union's fundamental values and nobody dares question it publicly, in their speeches."
"Nevertheless, the reality of European policies and those of its Member States in this area raises questions."
"It was in 1999 that the European Union started to harmonise its policies on the subject, and there seems today to be a sense of satisfaction at the spectacular fall in the number of asylum seekers."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left could also be pleased about this if that figure reflected an improvement in the human rights situation across the world."
"We all know that it does nothing of the sort."
"Our debates will prove it, if necessary, when they take place on Thursday afternoon."
"Since 2004, in particular, we have been seeing the downwards harmonisation of reception procedures and conditions."
"There are significant differences between countries' practices, and we know that some of the applications have been outsourced and that, today, some asylum seekers no longer even have the opportunity to register their applications."
"Once again, the prize for the biggest reduction in the number of asylum applications goes to France."
"As a human rights activist in France, I am well placed to know what has caused these results."
"To have accompanied an asylum seeker just once to the services of the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons is enough to know what the cause is."
"It is unbearable to watch the way in which these men and women are summoned to submit evidence of the acts of torture that they have suffered."
"The proposal that we are examining today therefore seems to be a breath of fresh air."
"It helps improve the implementation of a European system on the right to asylum."
"It aims to promote practical cooperation between Member States, in particular, by improving access to accurate information on countries of origin, which is a good thing."
"The majority of the proposals made by Parliament at first reading have been adopted by the Council."
"We know that we owe this result mainly to the Swedish Presidency, and we are grateful to it."
"I would add that, in my opinion, Sweden is, as it were, a model, and I would very much like other states to align themselves with it in this area."
"We have supported our rapporteur at both first and second readings in committee, and I too am keen to congratulate and thank her."
"We will do the same in plenary and we express our sincere hope that this small step forward will constitute a new turning point in European policy on this matter."
"We hope that, instead of Europe withdrawing into itself in what we in this House dare to call fortress Europe, we can instead welcome these men and women who have a right to asylum, as is proclaimed in the international treaties and in the European Convention on Human Rights, which we will soon be ratifying."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard it suggested that this measure relies on solidarity."
"In my humble opinion, something else is lacking - and that something is security."
"And yet, you only have to talk to those involved with these issues, for example, the police - on this occasion, I was lucky enough to be travelling with members of the law enforcement agencies, Carabiniere officers from the supply office in Turin, whom I would like to mention by name, Romanini and Tavano."
"They confirmed to me that in many cases, these asylum seekers show false cards and documents; cases of this have been reported by various police forces and other bodies."
"Would it not be a good idea to look at this question from a security angle as well?"
"I do not think that the question of security is very pronounced in this document and yet it is very important, because we must avoid contaminating an important principle, an important institution of such great humanitarian value, in other words, the entitlement to asylum, with the grubby interests of those who traffic in illegal immigrants and who often use asylum as a way of infiltrating people who have no rights and no relationship to those actually being persecuted."
"Secondly, Article 2 of the regulation states that the Office shall facilitate, coordinate and strengthen practical cooperation among Member States on the many aspects of asylum and help to improve the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, including its external dimensions."
"Article 7 should specify this, but it only does so very vaguely, saying that the Office can establish methods of cooperation with third countries on technical aspects."
"I believe that we must go much further, and I wonder why - despite many people, including us, proposing it - no one talks about or examines the suggestion of setting up these offices in third countries as well?"
"What is preventing it?"
"I think it is very important to filter, partly in order to lighten the workload and the situation of countries that have to deal more directly with this."
"Someone spoke of these countries' needs, but these countries must be supported, and I believe that offices should be established in third countries, for instance, in North Africa, in the sub-Saharan area, where there is a concentration of asylum applications and asylum seekers."
"Here, we need to filter, perhaps using the European Union's External Action Service, carrying out operations that would involve certain developing countries taking some responsibility; we need to give them a sense of responsibility where the asylum issue is concerned."
"I believe that these issues are very important and that we should not neglect them, nor should we ignore the needs of European Mediterranean countries affected by these issues, not merely by talking about them or by sending along a few officials; we already have our own bureaucrats in Italy."
"What we need in order to deal with this situation is money, resources, and real support."
"It has been said that in Sweden, things are going very well."
"That may be so, but Sweden is very far removed from the needs of Malta, Italy, France and the Mediterranean: this is where the problem is, and it needs to be addressed - and we must make the countries of the European Union responsible for this."
"Privileges and burdens go hand in hand, and since we have the burden, we should also have the means of dealing with it."
"(DE) Mr President, it is definitely not a bad idea to apply the regulations on asylum uniformly in order to reduce secondary immigration within the EU and to support those Member States with a very heavy influx of asylum seekers."
"However, there are serious doubts as to whether it is necessary to establish this support office to bring about improvements and whether the office will interfere too much in the powers of the Member States."
"Establishing this agency is another step towards centralising EU asylum policy."
"The aim is to achieve a high level of protection based on the actions of the most generous Member States, such as Austria."
"Existing differences are to be removed, with the more generous countries staying on the same course and the others making the necessary changes."
"That is all very well, but establishing large numbers of new EU agencies (the figure has tripled since 2000) and expanding their remit clearly goes against the attempts of the Lisbon Strategy to introduce more deregulation and subsidiarity."
"I believe that the widely discussed objective of circular migration - a bit here, a bit there, occasionally somewhere else - is totally wrong."
"It does not work in practice and circular migration often turns into permanent migration."
"There are, of course, other criticisms that can be made."
"Unrealistic conditions for detention pending deportation are put in place at the expense of security and at the expense of our executive."
"Extending the concept of the family to cover everyone including grandmothers will result in a further influx and improving access to the labour market in a period of high unemployment is unsustainable."
"It will not be possible to finance the extension of basic welfare provision to the same level as countries such as Austria and Germany."
"The new asylum support office is therefore not fit for purpose and should not be established."
"We must develop a common asylum strategy from scratch, because what you are recommending will not work in the countries that are affected."
"(EL) Mr President, the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office is indeed extremely important and thus, symbolically, I consider it to be important that it is being set up in Malta, a country in the south of Europe which is under a great deal of pressure from asylum seekers and also within the framework of illegal immigration issues."
"It is very important that we strengthen and coordinate cooperation between the Member States on asylum issues still further and, ultimately, that we try and arrive at a uniform approach from among the various national practices, especially as we all recognise the huge differences which exist."
"For example - this information is at the Commission's disposal, but I believe that it already knows that an Iraqi asylum seeker may have a 71% chance of his application being accepted in one Member State, but just a 2% chance in another Member State, and, of course, there are also different problems between the Member States."
"The Dublin II Regulation will, inevitably, put a heavier burden on some Member States compared with others, and, of course, this Asylum Office will also support the solidarity mechanisms available through the European Refugee Fund."
"I refer to the transportation and reallocation of refugees both from third countries in Europe and to the so-called internal 'reallocation' of refugees."
"As far as reallocation from third countries is concerned, we are making small steps, but we are progressing."
"However, as regards the internal reallocation of refugees, I wish to stress that, despite the fact that we all acknowledge that there is a greater burden on some Member States, especially in the south of Europe, compared with others, we have not made any specific proposal; we have not taken any initiative on these issues."
"We await the Commission's proposals; we have also sent a letter on the matter within the framework of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and, if nothing else, we must be bolder on these issues, because the pressures are great."
"To close, I have this to say: it is very important that we develop mechanisms in the European Union for receiving refugees, for accepting asylum seekers, not just for humanitarian reasons and for the reasons already referred to by numerous members, but also so that we can combat illegal immigration."
"We must give everyone seeking a better homeland, a better future, the message that, in Europe, anyone taking the legal route ultimately has a better chance than if they take the route of illegal immigration from which, unfortunately, there is a great deal of pressure."
"Mr President, the establishment of a European Asylum Support Office goes totally against the British opt-out on immigration and is at odds with the UK rejection of the Schengen acquis."
"The proposal that EUR 40 million will be spent establishing and staffing an entire office in Malta to deal with asylum seekers across the EU suggests that this Commission wants to make the decisions that should be left to national governments."
"Any common European asylum policy threatens British sovereignty over border control."
"Repeated appeals to let the UK decide who comes in and out of the country, and who can be accommodated, arise from the fact that we have a huge population problem that is quite unlike the situation anywhere else in Europe."
"The Commission does not offer help and support when the UK is struggling."
"Instead, it will take the money of the British taxpayer to cover the cost of making our decisions on our behalf."
"EUR 40 million would be better directed towards building new schools, hospitals and houses in the UK as well as affording critical services such as clean water, desperately needed if we are to continue providing a decent First World quality of life for everyone."
"One in four births are to mothers who themselves were not born in the UK, that is 170 000 births a year."
"Where is the money to help the British taxpayer afford all this?"
"In your pocket or spent on setting up a new asylum office which will no doubt pile more pressure on to the UK?"
"In our election campaigns, all the parties in the UK are promising to do something about immigration because the people back home are demanding something should be done."
"But what can Westminster do as long as we are in the EU, because at exactly the same time, the European Commission wants all the powers over asylum seekers passed to them?"
"Time and again, this Commission has shown only disregard for the wants and needs of the UK people."
"Is it the Commission's intention to repeal the UK opt-out in this area too?"
"The people back home deserve your honesty because this issue is extremely important to them."
"You are supposed to represent them and they deserve to know what you have planned."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must not shroud in solidarity an office that must support a procedure for establishing the true conditions of asylum seekers."
"We believe that this is important and useful, but that it must ensure, on the one hand, that those who actually have the right to asylum are granted it more quickly, and, on the other hand, that those who do not have the necessary rights and try to abuse this system are firmly dealt with, because it is clear that not all those who have the right to asylum are granted it."
"I would like, very briefly, to echo the statements of Mr Borghezio: certain countries, such as Italy, and particularly southern Italy, where I come from, provide natural entry routes for immigration and are particularly affected by asylum applications due to their historical traditions of welcoming immigrants."
"Europe must take charge of this, and the European Union must focus its attention and efforts, including its economic efforts, in those areas that receive the most immigrants."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am grateful for the strong support for creating this agency by a majority of this plenary."
"As you know, there has been a unanimous demand from Member States to create this agency, even those under opt-out, who know that the Commission has no intention of forcing any changes in the UK opt-out."
"That is the decision of the UK people."
"But there has also been a strong support in this plenary for an agency, and I am very glad that it is going to be created now."
"We know that, especially in certain seasons, there is a great pressure on the countries in the Mediterranean, and this agency can help and support."
"There are also migrants coming to northern, eastern, western and central Europe, so this is an agency for the whole of Europe, even if it is no coincidence that it is located in Valetta."
"It is not just another agency."
"It is, in fact, a cornerstone in building a common asylum system and it will be an important instrument in supporting Member States, in helping develop practices and common standards, and in supporting Member States under particular pressure."
"It would gather information, it would put up a portal, it would have experts, etc. Ultimately, it is always up to the Member States as to who can stay, but there are certain procedures which need to be harmonised."
"As some of you have said, this is part of developing a common asylum system in Europe."
"This is just one part: as I think the rapporteur said, we are stuck when it comes to the rest of the asylum package."
"The Commission counts on the help and support of the European Parliament in moving on with these issues so that, within the not too distant future, we can indeed establish a common asylum policy in the European Union."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to just take an opportunity to clear up one or two questions which have arisen, although it is a pity that some of those asking the questions are not around for the answers."
"Asylum obligations are clearly set out under international conventions which all Member States have individually signed up to."
"That is not the same as an immigration policy, and people really should recognise the difference."
"For those who are concerned about the money - if I may make a party political and national political point here - if certain of our Member States stopped creating asylum seekers from Iraq and Afghanistan, I am sure we could save a lot more money and indeed save people a lot more misery."
"As regards some of the other points which were raised, it is hoped that improving the quality of the system in certain Member States will be able to increase confidence between Member States and deblock some of the other parts of the asylum system, as well as helping Member States feel that there is support when they are facing particular burdens."
"As others have pointed out, while some of our Member States do have considerable geographical pressures on them from the flows which arrive, many of the over-burdened countries are actually not in the European Union at all but are elsewhere."
"I was very interested to hear a colleague arguing for additional support out there, in terms of the Asylum Support Office, but I am afraid I missed the amendments which he tabled on that topic."
"I also want to be clear that the Asylum Support Office is not there to determine status; it is not taking over the role of Member States in that field."
"All in all, I welcome the kind comments made by colleagues, I welcome the active involvement of those who have helped me very much on this report, and I am sure that we are all looking forward - or most of us anyway - to being there in Valletta when the ribbon is cut on the Asylum Support Office and we can begin work."
"I am going to close the debate."
"I will not do so, however, without saying with great feeling that I am not unmoved by the fact that the person who chaired this debate enjoyed the right of asylum because of the generosity and hospitality of the governments and people of France, Austria and Belgium, to whom I would like to pay a tribute of thanks here today, because there is no time limitation on gratitude, even though this happened more than 40 years ago."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the part-session in the first week of May"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Setting up the European Asylum Support Office is an extremely important step in establishing a European Common Asylum System, as provided for in the European Immigration and Asylum Pact and the Stockholm Programme."
"The Office will help increase cooperation between European institutions, local authorities and civil society, and will identify common practices in asylum matters."
"I am confident that this will bring Member States' positions closer together with regard to asylum-related policies."
"This matter is an absolute necessity, given that some Member States are facing large influxes of asylum seekers."
"Cooperation and solidarity are also needed between Member States not only to help these countries cope with the problems they are facing, but also to improve the European Common Asylum System."
"I must mention that this system will be based, from a legal and practical perspective, on the full, overall application of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"General provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund as regards simplification of certain requirements and as regards certain provisions relating to financial management (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Evgeni Kirilov, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 concerning general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund as regards simplification of certain requirements and as regards certain provisions relating to financial management - C7-0003/2010 -."
"Mr Kirilov, the rapporteur for the report, has not been able to come as a result of the air transport situation."
"Mrs Krehl, who is replacing Mr Kirilov, has the floor."
"Mr President, I am very sorry that Mr Kirilov cannot present the report himself."
"He has worked very hard to draw up a report for Parliament on a subject which is very important for the regions and the citizens of the European Union."
"Therefore, I would like to read out his notes."
"They are in English, which is very surprising for a Bulgarian Member."
"However, it is a good thing that I do not have to speak Bulgarian."
"I am very pleased that I can represent him here in Parliament, even though he was unable to get a flight in Sofia."
"Mr President, I am glad that this evening we have the opportunity to discuss important amendments to the Structural Funds general regulation."
"These modifications are a substantial element of the common efforts at European and national level to overcome the consequences of the economic crisis."
"They are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year."
"Then, as the rapporteur on the role of the cohesion policy for investment in the real economy, I called on the Council and Commission to work for simplification of the Structural Funds rules and thus facilitating access to these funds when they are more needed by the Member States."
"I am happy that Parliament's main recommendations for further simplification have been taken on board."
"I am convinced that the new changes to the general regulations, simplifying some of the existing procedures, deserve our support."
"Reducing unnecessary administrative burden, red tape and unclear rules will contribute to more transparency, better control and fewer irregularities."
"This also means improved implementation and correct spending on EU money."
"Here is just one example."
"Through the amendment of Article 88, the Member States are further stimulated to detect and correct irregularities before they are found by the EU controlling institutions."
"In this case, the Member States will not lose the affected money but will be able to use them again for other projects within the relevant programme."
"The second group of amendments concern financial management rules."
"Advance payments for countries worst hit by the crisis will be increased for 2010."
"All Member States will receive more time to spend 2007-committed funds for projects which have not been approved or implemented within the deadlines."
"Both groups of measures are important because of their message to the beneficiaries and because of their practical utility."
"Anti-crisis measures are a clear demonstration of solidarity."
"They will bring fresh money for the Member States to get out of the crisis."
"All measures will commit realisation of more projects, especially now."
"This is crucial for the creation of jobs, investment and infrastructure and adaptation of workers and firms to the economic change."
"Both types of measures are useful and more valuable if they are implemented at the right time, but they are still awaiting final approval."
"Unfortunately, there was a huge delay in the Council for reaching an agreement when it was the leading body for the adoption of the amended regulation."
"I strongly believe that now, when Parliament has the same power as the Council, we will not postpone any more the approval and entry into force of these long-awaited and needed measures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Krehl, thank you very much for your report."
"I would also like to ask you to pass on my thanks to Mr Kirilov."
"He has worked very hard to ensure that we are able to discuss these proposed amendments to the general regulation today, after they have passed so quickly through all the institutional stages, and also, I hope, to enable us adopt them shortly in Parliament with a broad majority, so that the relevant items can be implemented quickly."
"This is a good indication of the positive dialogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission and a good example of the fact that the interaction between the institutions is working effectively."
"What is the aim of these amendments?"
"In the long term, we want to simplify the regulations, but in the short term, we also want to help those Member States which have been hit hardest by the current economic crisis."
"We accept the Council's compromise proposal, which has gained broad agreement in Parliament, because it is important for us to provide rapid and targeted help and to get the programme under way."
"The common overall objective of this initiative is to accelerate the implementation of the programmes."
"We have recently presented the first strategy report and have identified those things which did not work particularly well and those areas where there were positive developments during the first few years of the current programme period."
"We must be self-critical and take a look at the rules which, in some places, are complex."
"In my opinion, the current third series of amendments to the ongoing programme has succeeded in resolving this problem."
"In addition, we want to help to overcome the crisis."
"What can be done?"
"To give you a few isolated examples: standardising the thresholds for large projects at EUR 50 million, simpler regulations for modifying operational programmes if - and this is a very important point - this is necessary to overcome the crisis, making it possible to subsidise energy efficiency measures in the construction and renovation of housing, which will not only result in energy savings, but will also have a positive impact on the sectors associated with the building industry."
"The current regulation is aimed in particular at the existing liquidity problems of the five countries affected - Romania, Hungary and the three Baltic states - and is intended, as has already been said, to speed up the absorption of the funds as a result of increased flexibility."
"It will be possible to implement many projects more quickly using the promised funding of EUR 775 million which can be made available earlier than planned."
"Finally, against this background, I would like to refer to the EUR 6.2 billion that has already been paid out in advance in 2009."
"It shows that, although the Structural Funds were not originally intended as emergency funding and should not, in future, be regarded as such, if necessary, they can be sufficiently flexible to make a suitable contribution in times of crisis."
"I would like to thank everyone and I am looking forward to the discussion."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Kirilov, even in his forced absence, and highlighting the way in which he was able to draw up this important report and promote its main objective."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Krehl for the presentation she has given us."
"The main objective, to go straight to the point, is to simplify procedures and to speed up implementation of the programmes financed from the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds and the European Regional Development Fund."
"In the current financial, economic and social crisis, pressure on national financial resources has been growing."
"That pressure will be reduced through better use of Community financing and swifter delivery of those resources to the beneficiaries worst affected by the economic downturn."
"More than 20 million Europeans are unemployed, or 4 million more than a year ago, and unfortunately, the forecast is for the number to rise further."
"This situation demands that we ensure that cohesion programmes are properly implemented, since they are an important, powerful lever for helping the real economy, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for jobs."
"SMEs are the motor of the European economy and producers of sustainable growth, creating numerous quality jobs."
"Further simplification and clarification of the rules governing cohesion policy will undeniably have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation, particularly by providing national, regional and local authorities with clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility in order to adapt the programmes to the new challenges."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having cooperated constructively for months with the rapporteur, Mr Kirilov, I am keen to express my heartfelt thanks to him here."
"I also wish to highlight the quality of the work carried out by the Council, in particular, since the start of the Spanish Presidency."
"This is all the more important because this evening, we are debating a regulation whose measures are awaited by thousands of actors on the ground."
"I am convinced that, for these actors on the ground, it is regional policy that is the most tangible expression of the European Union in their area or region."
"Nevertheless, although it is intended to help them, regional policy is too often seen as complex and restrictive."
"It is therefore time to change its image through an in-depth simplification of the rules on its application."
"The EUR 350 billion of European funds are for the benefit of our fellow European citizens."
"Today, we are demonstrating the responsive approach awaited on the ground, in these times of economic and social crisis that we are all experiencing."
"If I had to pick out only certain aspects of this important text, I would say that it gives us greater flexibility and solidarity in Europe."
"Greater flexibility, because the proposed simplification measures allow for a reduction in the amount of information to be provided, for fewer controls, and for greater flexibility on revenue-generating projects."
"However, it also increases solidarity, because exceptional measures are being taken to combat the economic crisis, such as financial advances - as the Commissioner and Mrs Krehl were saying - and a new calculation system."
"The final vote at the start of May will, therefore, allow us to be of great help to the recipients of European funding as well as to planning departments, but let us not forget that there is still much to be done in the field of simplification."
"Mr President, Mr Hahn, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Hahn has summed up the purpose of our debate this evening, which is to provide rapid and targeted help."
"We urgently need to speed up the implementation of these programmes."
"I believe that the third amendment to the general structural funds regulation is a response to the financial crisis and should, as has already been said, allow for rapid and, in particular, easy access to these funds."
"We know from past experience that money from the Structural Funds has made a significant contribution to improving quality of life, creating jobs and giving people a future in the regions."
"I believe that in times such as these, the solidarity of the European Union is needed in order to provide emergency funding."
"As we have said, both flexibility and solidarity are required."
"Measures to combat the crisis are indications of this solidarity and we need the flexible advance payments so that these projects, which improve quality of life and create jobs, can be implemented."
"As the rapporteur - or in this case, this evening Mrs Krehl - has already mentioned, there was an almost unpardonable delay in adopting this regulation."
"From this perspective in particular, future cohesion policy should be designed in such a way that it does not put procedural and technical obstacles in the way of quick and efficient implementation of regional policy."
"Therefore, I support the rapporteur's call for this amendment to the structural fund regulation to enter into force quickly."
"We must provide rapid and targeted help."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Hahn, let us speak plainly."
"The simplification that everyone here is so much in favour of will mean that large sewage plants and huge waste incinerators will no longer, as is currently the case in the regulation, have to be approved by the Commission when the investment is greater than EUR 25 million, but only when the amount exceeds EUR 50 million."
"For projects with a value under EUR 50 million, the Commission will no longer evaluate cost-benefit analyses and it may be that these analyses will no longer be carried out."
"In contrast to the current situation, no checks will be made to determine whether or not these projects comply with EU environmental legislation."
"On account of the fact that these projects are partially financed by loans, there will also be no investigations to establish whether it makes sense to burden the citizens of the region with heavy borrowing and to identify whether the credit burden is in proportion to the benefits of the project for the citizens."
"These are attractive transactions for the banks, because they can charge high fees during the initial years of the project."
"This is why in the past, ex-ante evaluations of large projects were essential in order to ensure the efficient use of European funds."
"This is why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are of the opinion that checks on large projects must be increased, rather than reduced as specified in this proposal."
"Therefore, we are against raising the evaluation threshold."
"In addition, we want cost-benefit analyses and compliance with EU legislation to be transparent to the public and not to be fudged, as has been the case in the past."
"The Structural Funds regulation continues to suffer from the fact that large projects which receive finance can only last for five years from the time when the investment is made."
"Therefore, we Greens have already called for an extension of ten years to ensure the true sustainability of the investments and to create permanent jobs in the regions."
"If projects are based in the regions for a longer period, this will prevent those responsible for the projects from pocketing European subsidies and then simply disappearing after five years."
"The case of Nokia in North Rhine-Westphalia demonstrates the damage that can be caused to regions when subsidy hopping becomes widely accepted."
"In our opinion, the sustainability clause should therefore remain in place for small and medium-sized businesses for five years and not for three years, as proposed in the amendment."
"We Greens are also opposed to this, because a combination of larger investments without checks and a shorter duration for projects is highly likely to result in money being poured down the drain."
"We believe that it is not possible to justify this to European taxpayers."
"If our amendments are not accepted, we cannot vote in favour of the report."
"We will also request a roll-call vote, so that when citizens complain to us at a later date that money has been wasted, we can show them how the Members voted."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(NL) Mr President, I have a question for Mrs Schroedter."
"In her analysis, she has chosen to take a rather negative approach."
"My question to her is: is it not the case that, thanks to the cofinancing, the local governments which implement the programmes in the Member States within the strategic frameworks agreed for each country and within the rules are required to fulfil their own responsibilities?"
"Why is she painting such a negative picture today?"
"There is no reason for bringing all that negativity to this proposal today."
"(DE) Mr President, I will be happy to answer the question."
"Investment in large projects is being simplified."
"This applies to investments of up to EUR 50 million which, until now, have been evaluated by the EU, because we are responsible for taxpayers' money."
"I am of the opinion that the situation should remain unchanged for large projects because, in our experience, these projects often start with excessive investment and end up with the burden being borne by the citizens."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating here a compromise proposal to amend the regulation, a proposal aimed at simplifying and speeding up access to European funds."
"We definitely have a common interest in achieving this aim, and we should bear that in mind during debates on the future of the cohesion policy after the year 2014."
"The proposed arrangement applies, above all, to large projects connected with the environment and infrastructure, projects which generate profits and support for energy projects and renewables in the housing sector."
"The compromise proposal does not, therefore, involve any radical intervention in the architecture of the European funds."
"Sweeping changes are not even possible at the moment."
"We can only manage a gradual modernisation of the existing system."
"The proposal is a compromise."
"At this point, I would like to state that I support the declaration submitted by Hungary relating to the use of financial engineering instruments within the framework of the Cohesion Fund for interventions in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources."
"On the other hand, I am concerned about the retroactive measure relating to liabilities, because it will not be approved until 2010, while the resources should have been returned to EU coffers at the end of 2009."
"In this context, it is therefore vital to clarify all of the technical details of this legislation."
"However, a compromise has been found and the debate should therefore be concluded."
"I consider it vital that the simplification of the European funds, which we are approving today in Strasbourg, is reflected on the ground in the Member States."
"In this context, we still have much work to do in our regions."
"I must applaud the efforts of the current Ministry of Local Development in the Czech Republic which, in the middle of this year, approved a legislative amendment on the drawing of individual sums from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"This administrative simplification mainly involves approval procedures and financial planning and management, including control activities and the resolution of discrepancies."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and I would like to make a few remarks."
"The first is that we very much welcome the simplification of the Structural Funds."
"There are certainly some things which we would criticise and Mrs Schroedter has mentioned these, but I believe that we should not hold back for this reason alone."
"We welcome the simplification and are also of the opinion that the regulation must be implemented urgently."
"Too much time has already been wasted."
"However, I must speak openly."
"The compromise is not exactly how we had envisaged it."
"As everyone is aware, the Commission submitted another proposal relating to the one-off 100% payment of interim payment claims for a limited period and for the purpose of labour market policy measures."
"This was not accepted for a variety of reasons which were discussed in detail in the Committee on Regional Development."
"However, we must ask ourselves whether we have done enough to put in place what the Commission referred to in its communication of 3 June 2009 as a common commitment to employment which can be used to counteract the crisis."
"The objective was to make it easier to use the Structural Funds to help overcome the crisis and this is what we are discussing now."
"The European Structural Funds in particular are, as everyone knows, one of the main tools for investing in citizens and for combating the crisis and creating jobs."
"If we take a look at Europe, it becomes clear that the crisis has had a huge impact on the labour markets in the Member States and that action really is needed."
"There have been massive increases in unemployment, not only in the five countries, but in all the Member States, if we look at the situation in detail."
"In addition, unemployment also plays a major role independently of the crisis."
"In Europe, we have a very high level of unemployment which is still rising and is unrelated to the crisis."
"The alternative proposal submitted by the Commission certainly represents a step forward, which we welcome, because at least five Member States with a GDP that has fallen by 10% since 2008 will receive a relatively large subsidy."
"These Member States will benefit from this and from additional advance payments from the Cohesion and European Structural Funds."
"All of this is good, but we would like to see more being done."
"You know what our position is from what we have said in the committee."
"On the one hand, we are happy and, on the other hand, not so happy, but every step forward takes us forward too and this is where we should be going."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Mr President, the only question is why your group, Mrs Ernst, has not tabled an amendment in plenary?"
"There was an opportunity to table amendments so that the Commission's original draft could be reused."
"It may also have been possible to renegotiate the 100% financing of the European Structural Funds with the Council."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Schroedter, I think we believed that we had only a limited chance and therefore decided against it."
"I assume that my colleague thought the same thing."
"When I looked at the Commission's overall initiative, I was thrilled."
"However, after long discussions on these subjects in the last few days, I have learnt a few things."
"I would have liked to see more."
"It is true that we could have submitted an amendment, you are right."
"However, if we are honest with one another, we know what will happen and this is why my group decided against an amendment."
"I must take note of that myself."
"(NL) Mr President, exceptional times call for exceptional measures."
"Today, this House's long-cherished dream of a simplified procedure and more rapid results has come true."
"What we ultimately want is to retain and create jobs and this week, as Mr Hahn has pointed out, some figures have emerged revealing what that cohesion policy has been able to achieve: 1.4 million more jobs in the previous period."
"European funds can now be provided in a faster and more simple way across the board, not just for major projects but for smaller ones, too, so that we can continue to promote innovation, environmental improvements, urban development, etc."
"There is one point which Parliament opposed and that was the proposal to scrap cofinancing."
"Now, that would be threatening one of the cornerstones of our system, whereby national administrations, local authorities and, where possible, individuals, contribute to the joint project of regional and urban development."
"So we now have to concentrate on maintaining funding for a slightly longer period, for three, rather than two, years, which is another point to which you have agreed."
"That will leave money on the table, cofinancing will be possible and the good thing about it is that, in the case of any delay, we will still be able to allow those valuable projects to go ahead."
"That does not mean money leaving the region: oh no, it means money being spent."
"That is the scheme we have operated for 2007."
"I have a question for Mr Hahn: does he not want to follow this good example with another?"
"Why can we not repeat this scheme in 2008 and 2009?"
"That would be a very positive step."
"Can you answer that?"
"To conclude, we could also show some solidarity."
"There are some countries which do not use all of the ESF funds granted to them and leave some 30 or 40% unspent."
"Why have they not shown any solidarity and transferred those resources to other countries?"
"That is entirely permissible and would allow those countries to get back on their feet."
"That would be showing real solidarity, but unfortunately it has not happened."
"I therefore feel reasonably positive, at least towards the rapporteur."
"This procedure has now taken nine months and I wonder, as indeed did Mrs Krehl, whether it would be possible to complete it during the next joint round of negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission?"
"(GA) Mr President, since 1973, my country has received roughly EUR 18 billion from the European Union Structural and Cohesion Fund."
"Over the years, the cohesion policy has played a significant role in developing and revitalising the Irish economy."
"The European Social Fund is particularly important as we attempt to combat unemployment in Ireland and, of course, throughout Europe."
"Since Ireland joined the European Union in 1973, the country has received more than EUR 7 billion in financial support under the European Social Fund."
"These monies have primarily been used to help combat youth and long-term unemployment."
"Under the EU Human Resources Operational Programme for Ireland for the period 2007 to 2013, the European Union is providing EUR 375 million to Ireland under the European Social Fund."
"The overall budget of this programme is EUR 1.36 billion."
"These monies are being used to provide training courses for those who are unemployed, for people with disabilities, for early school leavers and for the marginalised in our society."
"We live in the age of globalisation."
"To respond to the challenges and opportunities that globalisation creates for the Irish workforce, the European Social Fund in Ireland is also supporting lifelong training courses, which can be adapted to the realities of a globalised jobs market."
"So the present economic and financial crisis has proven the relevance and the value of this important fund - the European Social Fund."
"Mr Chairman, fundamentally, this report seems to have some very good objectives helping the Member States of the EU, who have been hard hit by the economic and financial crisis, via European funding."
"It has the laudable goal of wanting to reduce strains on Member States' budgets when demands upon them are coming from all directions."
"Reducing the project thresholds and simplifying the process will all help, as well as the pre-financing of agreed projects to jump start economies quickly."
"When Europe is facing unemployment figures in excess of 10%, in many Member States much worse, and the economy looks only now to be slowly reviving, there are many things Member States should be doing to rebuild their state finances."
"However, this report is fairly limited and does not seem to address many of them."
"However, a note of caution: the idea that Member States should no longer have to cofinance projects with any of their own money seems a high-risk policy."
"Already, much of European money is not properly accounted for in spending projects due to improper oversight procedures."
"Removing a Member State's vested interest in ensuring its own money is well-spent should not be an invitation to their misuse."
"We need to ensure that relaxing the cofinance criteria does not reduce accountability."
"However, this problem in itself is unlikely to have much effect on my constituents in Wales as, if the European Union has its own way, we will not, post 2013, have any more money to spend on any ongoing projects, which are so generously cofunded by the European funding at this moment in time."
"While it is all very well to say that some of the new Member States are poorer than the old and so need special help, the colossal amount of debt in the UK and the very low GDP per capita in my region of Wales, which was recently compared, unhelpfully, to the economic performance of Rwanda, hopefully mean it will not be forgotten."
"I have discovered by word of mouth that plans may be under way to disqualify regions like Wales, and I do hope that in the future, we will qualify for transitional funding."
"(BG) Commissioner, I first of all want to congratulate Mr Kirilov on his report."
"I welcome and support any step which guarantees and facilitates the lawful use of European solidarity funds."
"The European Union cannot allow itself to be compared by EU citizens to a volcano ejecting bureaucratic ash, raining down on the desire to reduce the disparities between Europe's regions."
"It is difficult, even impossible to use the Structural Funds with which we want to achieve our economic, social and political objectives."
"I believe that changes towards simplifying the procedures must not only be viewed in the light of the current crisis, but must also, in the long term, facilitate access to the European Union's solidarity instruments."
"I think that, in spite of the delay, the proposal tabled by the European Commission, along with the changes featuring in this report, will offer a better opportunity for Member States and the ultimate beneficiaries to improve their situation in the context of the current crisis."
"I want to emphasise the significance of the change concerning deferred expenditure of the resources envisaged for 2007."
"This change will offer a second opportunity to all Member States, including Bulgaria, where the level of use of these resources is still very low, to implement projects using resources which would have otherwise been lost."
"We must appeal to regional and local authorities, as well as to all other stakeholders, and urge them to take advantage of this second chance."
"I believe that the flexibility highlighted in the report, bearing in mind the implementation of programmes promoting the use of funds, is the right approach when drawing up privatisation policy in future."
"With regard to simplifying administrative regulations for using the Structural Funds, the report is a step in the right direction towards finding a balance between facilitating the coordination of projects as much as possible by the European funds and controlling the use of these resources."
"Reforming the regulations must be instrumental in guaranteeing greater transparency in the eyes of European citizens and taxpayers, as well as in helping set out feasible conditions for Member States."
"During the whole process, we must not forget the ultimate goal, which is to achieve comparable social and economic conditions throughout the European Union."
"(HU) Since the outbreak of the economic crisis, the European Union has been criticised on several occasions as being incapable of responding in an appropriate way to the crisis situation."
"My view on this is that the current debate and Mr Kirilov's excellent report are an outstanding refutation of that, showing that the European Union was able to respond to these processes."
"I do not understand colleagues who worry that the current simplifications will mean that the processes will not be monitored, since the great value of the cohesion policy is precisely that it has a very accurate supervisory mechanism."
"Therefore, no one should worry, and if my fellow Members worry about this, I hope that this is not a deficit of solidarity on their part with those Member States - for instance, with my country, Hungary - which, in their opinion, will not use these funds appropriately."
"We will indeed use them very properly."
"This debate is also very important in order to confirm that the cohesion policy is needed."
"I am pleased that Mr Hahn and Mr CioloÅ are here."
"I am very worried that Mr Barroso's first document does not even mention the common agricultural policy, and even the cohesion policy is mentioned only very superficially, even though these are extremely important cohesion and Community policies which are indispensable for green growth, innovation and job creation, in other words, in order to realise the EU 2020 strategy's new objectives."
"Therefore, cohesion policy should not be weakened, but strengthened instead."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of all the amendments made to legislative frameworks at Community and national level aimed at tackling the effects of the crisis, its impact on the real economy and labour market is being felt strongly at the moment on a wide scale."
"High unemployment is having a severe impact on Member States' economies, but there are still great difficulties in providing finances."
"The effective implementation of the cohesion policy programmes is essential as it provides a significant boost in granting aid to the real economy in the form of the EUR 347 billion allocated for the 2007-2013 period."
"Additional efforts must be targeted at the beneficiaries who have been hardest hit in order to speed up the flow of finances for funding the investments in the Member States' regions."
"I think that one important change which has been made is the opportunity to fund a single major project from various programmes in the case of projects which cover several regions."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on the job he has done."
"However, I need to make one remark that, although the report was much awaited, progress on it was slow."
"I suggest that we need to find solutions and give a much higher priority to the objectives in order to avoid situations where excellent measures are delayed too long."
"Simplifying administrative procedures in general will help boost the ability to absorb these funds, including in countries faced with this problem, in other words, my own country, Romania."
"The eruption of a volcano has turned the world upside down in five days and may trigger another crisis."
"How long will it take us to have the capability to respond?"
"One thing which is very clear to me is that from now on, we need to make decisions much more quickly."
"(Applause)"
"(SK) I would like to begin by applauding the work of the rapporteur, Mr Kirilov."
"It is a very good thing that, with the aim of responding to the economic crisis, European institutions have decided to speed up the process of financing regional development projects, and also to simplify rules regulating the use of structural funds."
"There is also to be an extension of the time period for using EU funds approved in 2007 in order to give Member States more time to make use of them."
"In Slovakia, we have a saying that help given quickly is twice as effective."
"The Member States most affected by the economic crisis are looking forward to the regulation which we are discussing today."
"The Commission presented the first draft as long ago as July last year."
"We will not decide until May."
"The whole legislative process has taken nine months up to today."
"Perhaps it is time to start thinking about a simpler and shorter legislative process in concrete, specified cases."
"The crisis, unemployment, poverty and deepening regional divides are precisely the kind of cases where it is necessary to act more quickly and more flexibly."
"We will find it difficult to explain to the unemployed that it took us more than three quarters of a year to pass the legislation which is supposed to help them now, in their time of need."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all in agreement today in welcoming the measures to simplify the awarding of the Structural Funds proposed in Mr Kirilov's report."
"Nevertheless, as Chair of Parliament's Work Group on the European Social Fund, I am indignant at how long the review procedure that is currently in progress has taken."
"The Commission's initial proposal dates from June 2009."
"Even though the purpose of this review was to help Member States combat the economic and social crisis, it took the Council six months to reach an agreement."
"That is unacceptable."
"It is true that the legislative procedure has been modified along the way to give Parliament the same amount of power as the Council."
"However, as the elected representatives of the European Union, we cannot today justify these delays to the public."
"I will now make a brief digression to welcome the responsibility shown by Parliament in agreeing as far as possible on the Council's position in order not to delay the procedure any further."
"However, I would like to express my disappointment once again."
"We need a European Union that can take swift decisions that have a real impact on the ground."
"Now let us turn to the future for a moment."
"The simplification measures proposed today to combat the economic crisis are positive, but I would like to add that they could have been even more ambitious if the measures being applied to the current programming period, 2007-2013, had not been so clumsy and complicated."
"Therefore, looking ahead to the negotiations for the multiannual legislative framework for 2014-2020, I call on the European Parliament to demonstrate boldness in its proposals for the simplification of the administration and application of the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also voice my appreciation for the report by Mr Kirilov, and I am sorry that he cannot be here today."
"Further simplification of the mechanisms relating to the Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund is a good idea, and will be good for expenditure."
"At a time when these funds are also being used to combat the crisis, we must put the paying agencies in a position where they can spend all their money; but this measure of ours also means that there is one less excuse."
"One less excuse for whom?"
"For the regions which, for example, spend the Cohesion Fund and which often cannot spend all their money because they unable to do so but still hold the chaotic nature and the excessive bureaucracy of European procedures responsible for their lack of expenditure."
"Today, this excuse is no longer valid; today, all the bodies in charge of distributing European funds are put in a position where ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) The effects of the economic crisis have been felt since 2008."
"The main problems we are currently facing are unemployment, a decline in living standards and poverty."
"In terms of the European Union's policies, constant efforts have been made to expand and improve the instruments available for tackling these effects, which also means encouraging economic growth in Europe."
"Mr Kirilov's report is a good example of this."
"It has been drafted on the basis of some excellent, welcome proposals from the Commission intended to simplify the application procedure enabling Member States to access the relevant funds."
"I welcome and support the report drafted by Mr Kirilov in terms of both pooling the amounts offered for major projects and of adapting specific technical criteria and conditions in order to facilitate the management of the funds available."
"These amendments are in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, which encourages job creation and supports investment geared towards environmental protection."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Hahn, those who have spoken before me have already mentioned the benefits of cohesion policy, and I do not want to repeat this here."
"I just want to stress that my country of Poland and my region of Wielkopolska are also benefiting from cohesion policy."
"I am very glad about this, and this is how I understand the amendments to the regulation."
"I am glad about the constant effort for better absorption of funds - better absorption of funds as part of cohesion policy."
"For implementation and absorption to be better, it is essential to have continuous simplification and continuous liberalisation of the legislation which governs implementation of this policy."
"This is why I understand the regulation as the next step, to simplify implementation."
"I am pleased about this."
"I would also like to say that this effort must be continuous."
"We must fight excessive bureaucracy all the time, and all the time we must try to ensure that legislation is favourable to beneficiaries."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Hahn, cohesion policy is an important political tool."
"It gives us the opportunity to help to combat the crisis, to stimulate demand in the short term and, at the same time, to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness."
"It is important to make it very clear that cohesion policy and, in particular, the advance payments and more rapid local implementation in 2009 made a very significant contribution to boosting purchasing power which benefited the economy and helped to limit the fall in private consumption."
"Cohesion policy also forms a very important part of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Therefore, I do not understand why your fellow Commissioner, Mr Rehn, has linked sanction mechanisms for a failure to comply with the regulations of the single financial market to restrictions on regional policy."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote will be taken on the Kirilov report in the next few weeks and I welcome this, as the need is urgent."
"The public and our elected representatives have been waiting nearly a year now for tangible and permanent measures from the cohesion policy in response to the crisis; national and local actors have spent a year calling for greater flexibility and adaptability in the awarding of European funds."
"Today, with Parliament reflecting on new measures aimed at greater transparency in the use of the Cohesion Fund, we need, more than ever, to succeed in our move to simplify these requirements."
"The Kirilov report is a first step towards this simplification."
"It must call for others, because the credibility and visibility of European action in day-to-day life are at stake."
"This report is also proof of Europe's solidarity, that in these times of doubt about our unity, it can provide those members who need them with measures adapted to their situation."
"In these dark and overcast times, the Kirilov report may be a breath of fresh air."
"I hope that this report will be only a first step."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank everyone who made their way to the Chamber from nearby or from further away for showing such commitment during the debate."
"I would like to thank you, because you have given your broad support to cohesion policy and to the realisation that it allows us to help our regions and the people in the regions."
"The Czech Member referred to the saying that help given quickly is twice as effective."
"I would say that this is a European insight."
"Despite all the difficulties and mistakes, we have adhered to this principle in the initiative."
"My brief response to Mrs Schroedter is that you do not need to worry that the control mechanisms will suffer simply because we have standardised the thresholds so that we can evaluate projects, which often cover both areas, in a uniform way."
"There are also control mechanisms at local and national level."
"This is the concept behind shared management."
"We are also governed by other regulations, for example, in public procurement and in the State aid system."
"These also involve certain deadlines which we, as regional politicians, cannot simply ignore."
"As far as the extension of the N+3 regulation is concerned, I believe that we should take a very restrictive approach."
"We should ensure that the rules are not relaxed and that the regions do not think that they can sit back and do nothing."
"Instead, they must be committed to using the funds that are available."
"Please could you pass on to Mrs Swinburne that there are no indications at all that what she is afraid of will happen, provided that the budget is sufficiently large."
"We will be providing the available regional funds to Wales and to all the other regions in future."
"For this reason, I do not approve of using the money from the Structural Funds in difficult times to apply apparent sanctions that have no effect."
"Thank you once again for your broad support."
"I include in my thanks the members of staff of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy who have worked very hard in this area."
"Mr President, I will be happy to pass on all the praise and the positive assessments from today's discussion to Mr Kirilov."
"I would like to highlight two points once again."
"We only have European taxpayers' money to spend and therefore we must make the access to the funds as simple and as transparent as possible."
"That is the aim of this report."
"However, I also believe - and this request is directed at Mrs Schroedter - that we should not imply that the individual Member States are not doing everything possible to comply with European law."
"This is what I understand from reading between the lines today and I do not think we should imply this about anyone."
"I work on the assumption that all the Member States and all the institutions do everything they can to ensure that European funds are used efficiently and correctly."
"I would like to make a second remark to Mrs Swinburne, but not just to her."
"This is not about handing out charity to poor regions."
"We are subsidising regions to increase purchasing power and create jobs, because the purchasing power in these regions forms part of the overall contribution to ensuring that Europe can begin manufacturing and selling products again."
"This will strengthen the internal market."
"In other words, it is not simply an act of general solidarity."
"Anyone who knows something about the economy and the world of business will understand, not only from a social perspective, but also from a business and economic point of view, why we need regional policy and why we can use it as a rapid and efficient measure, in particular, in times of crisis, for stimulating the European economy in all of Europe's regions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the part-session in the first week of May"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"This report amending the general regulation on the implementation of Structural and Cohesion Funds is of particular importance to the European Union's citizens."
"A number of Member States, including Romania, have had a low uptake of European funds to date."
"A large number of citizens, companies and local authorities have criticised the complicated procedures obstructing them whenever they attempt to obtain funding for their projects."
"Drafting this report demonstrates the European Parliament's desire to resolve the problems highlighted in this regard."
"I support the proposals aimed at simplifying the procedures for accessing European funds."
"Reducing the amount of unnecessary administrative procedures and red tape, along with establishing clearer rules, will help raise the absorption level of European funds."
"I welcome these measures, especially at the moment when Member States are being affected by the economic crisis."
"Five European countries, including Romania, will take part in a process for accelerating the absorption of European funds."
"Implementing a new procedure for making advance payments will enable more projects to be completed more quickly."
"Furthermore, Romania will benefit from the amendment to the rules concerning the reduction in the risk of losing funds not used quickly enough."
"The economic crisis has demonstrated the need for public action to support private activities that are in difficulty."
"The European Union's cohesion policy plays an essential role in this regard."
"By providing financial support for those affected by the economic downturn, the Structural Funds constitute a lever with which to stimulate activity."
"Nonetheless, accessing European funding remains difficult for a number of potential beneficiaries."
"The procedures are complicated and the delays too long, even though the urgency of the crisis requires simple and rapid measures."
"As part of this concern for clarification, I welcome the Commission's initiative aimed at simplifying the financial management of the Structural Funds."
"The various proposals are along the lines of a more effective cohesion policy, but one that does not have too pronounced an impact on the Community budget."
"I welcome this pragmatic approach."
"The Commission must not stop there, however."
"This reform, necessitated by the crisis situation, must be the first stage of a radical simplification of the way in which European funds are managed."
"Cohesion policy must become an instrument for more effective public intervention with a view to providing real support for economic activity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"I also welcome the agreement being finally approved within the Council and Committee on Regional Development."
"I believe that it is of paramount importance for us to adopt this report as soon as possible so that we can offer the Member States which have been hardest hit by the crisis the financial support required for economic recovery."
"One of the key aspects highlighted in this report is the simplification of the procedures for accessing and implementing European funds."
"We need measures to facilitate a rapid recovery, especially now during an economic crisis."
"Consequently, I think that making advance payments of 2% from the European Social Fund and of 4% from the Cohesion Fund is the ideal solution for Member States which are facing significant liquidity problems, thereby allowing them to benefit from consistent assistance."
"The finances from the European Social Fund should make an active contribution to the economic recovery of the Member States which have been hardest hit by the crisis, helping their efforts to preserve jobs, improve the level of professional qualifications and, by extension, prevent and combat unemployment."
"in writing. - (EL) I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Evgeni Kirilov, and all the members of our Committee because, thanks to their persistence and decisiveness, we have managed to hold a debate today and proceed directly to the adoption of this exceptionally important report without wasting any more valuable time."
"I wish to emphasise the decisive role of the amendments in increasing the take-up of appropriations, reducing the bureaucracy and complexity of the rules, maximising the impact of financing on the economy as a whole and thus multiplying the benefits to citizens."
"In his audience, Commissioner Hahn quite rightly pointed out that, despite the fact that it is perhaps the most successful European policy, political cohesion has enemies as well as friends."
"The adoption of these amendments which we are debating today is an important step, but there is an even more urgent need for the European Commission to immediately take the next step, which is to bring its vision for political cohesion for tomorrow to the table, together with its ideas and proposals for the necessary changes to the framework, operation and competences, new tools and so forth."
"It is high time for this next step now before new unattributed documents surface."
"Specific measures for agricultural markets (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on specific measures for agricultural markets - B7-0208/2010)."
"As Mr De Castro is not present, Mr Le Foll, who is replacing Mr De Castro, has the floor."
"Mr President, it therefore falls to us to close these debates this evening, and it is already late."
"I would like, first of all, to excuse the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, who is unable to be here with us this evening for reasons that you know."
"Like other Members of this House, he has been unable to leave his country to come and participate in our debates in Strasbourg."
"The issue with which we are concerned results from the general crisis being experienced by the entire agricultural sector."
"As we know today, we are experiencing a crisis and, above all, seeing a fall in prices and agricultural revenues that is affecting cereal producers, livestock producers, whether pork or beef producers, and also - and I say this on behalf of Mr De Castro - olive oil producers, and which is hitting and has hit dairy producers extremely hard."
"Faced with this crisis and this price fall, it goes without saying that Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wishes to find out from the Commission what we can do right now and in the future to escape this crisis and, above all, what measures could be adopted in the coming months to support farmers and to ensure that the agricultural markets are less volatile."
"The first question that I would like to ask the Commissioner is more specifically about the dairy crisis: what is the situation with regard to the measures adopted by Parliament and the Council concerning this dairy crisis and, in particular, to the application of the famous EUR 300 million milk fund that had been agreed?"
"That is the first question because I think that, if we are going to take legislative decisions, then we must know how they are being applied."
"As I was saying, all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets."
"That brings us to a question and to seek answers on what we might call market regulation and the way in which we can limit this infamous price volatility."
"Nobody complains when prices are rising, especially not farmers."
"It is European consumers who fear agricultural price rises, which limit their purchasing power and impact on their ability to buy agricultural products."
"It is when prices are low and when they are falling for long periods that producers are penalised in terms of their incomes and, above all, and most seriously for European agriculture, in terms of their abilities to invest and to prepare for the future."
"Agriculture is a hard industry; the investments are substantial and it takes a long time to obtain a return on those investments."
"We need to stabilise prices."
"Commissioner, the question from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chair, Mr De Castro, is composed of two points."
"Firstly, you have announced a number of dairy-related measures to be implemented before the end of the year."
"This is important. Can you give us some details of these?"
"Secondly, there are specific measures that need to be taken on all the markets, not just dairy."
"Finally, the question that we wished to ask you is how the Commission plans to anticipate and prevent these price falls in the medium term."
"What market regulation mechanism can be used to limit sudden increases and, above all, sudden price falls?"
"What work is the Commission currently doing and how does it view this issue?"
"Those are the three elements that I wished to mention: the milk fund, perspectives on the dairy crisis and, more generally, the way in which the Commission intends to deal with this issue of price volatility and price falls."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr De Castro and Mr Le Foll, from Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for having raised these problems for discussion here in this House."
"It is true: I, too, must acknowledge that farmers' revenues fell spectacularly in 2009, which was nothing more than a continuation of the trend recorded in 2008."
"Therefore, this is a situation that we have seldom encountered on the European market."
"It coincides with this market increasingly opening up on the world market and follows the recent reforms of the common agricultural policy."
"This crisis has affected the dairy sector in particular."
"Last year, we saw the sector's producers endure a difficult situation, particularly those in rural regions in which dairy production is essential not only to the agricultural sector, but also to economic activity and employment in general."
"It is in this context that the European Commission took measures last year, firstly by mobilising mechanisms for intervening in the markets to halt the fall in prices."
"It released significant funds, more than EUR 400 million, to finance these interventions in the markets."
"However, as Mr Le Foll pointed out, a EUR 300 million fund was also mobilised to enable the Member States to come to the aid of the dairy sector's worst-affected producers."
"This decision, then, was taken last year."
"It gave the Member States the opportunity to set criteria on the basis of which funds would be distributed, channelling them, above all, to those producers who needed them most."
"I must also make it clear that these criteria were set by the Member States and did not require the Commission's approval."
"The Member States were simply obliged to inform, to notify the Commission of which criteria they had chosen."
"I can announce to you that, as far as I know, all the Member States informed the Commission of their decision to apply the measures."
"They have therefore set the criteria on the basis of which they will distribute these funds, and the process of distributing the aid will begin."
"The Member States have until June to distribute these funds."
"So, as I was saying, firstly, there has been a phase of intervening on the markets to put them back on an even keel."
"I think that the current situation shows us that this intervention has been successful, because prices have stabilised."
"There are still variations, of course, but they are within reasonable limits, within the normal limits of the market."
"Secondly, there are support measures that will be reaching producers soon."
"Those, then, are the measures that have already been taken."
"I am keen to restate here what I recently told Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development: as Commissioner, I hope to learn lessons from the specific situation that we experienced last year."
"I do not wish to wait for the common agricultural policy post-2013 reform, when we will certainly come here with more solid answers for the entire agricultural sector."
"I will not wait for the conclusion of the common agricultural policy 2013 reform to make specific proposals for the dairy sector, on the basis of the conclusions of the high-level group that was created last year in the wake of this crisis and whose work is now under way."
"This group will present its findings in June."
"Immediately afterwards, in July, I will propose a debate to the Council of Ministers of Agriculture and to Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the basis of these findings."
"So between now and autumn or the end of the year, I will come here with proposals that will allow us to foresee and, as far as possible, prevent this sort of crisis - especially in the dairy sector, because it has experienced the most difficult circumstances of all - and thus to propose solutions, not just for the short term, but also for the medium and long terms."
"We will, of course, learn lessons from this for other agricultural sectors in which we will have to intervene."
"Perhaps I could now take the opportunity to give you some information to follow on from the debates that we will have today."
"The Commission pays close attention to the development of the markets in other sectors."
"Using the intervention methods that we currently have at our disposal - mechanisms for intervening in the markets, used in particular as safety nets - we will do our best to prevent a repeat of situations similar to that which has hit the dairy sector."
"Thank you very much."
"I will listen closely to the questions and problems that you are going to raise and I will take the floor again at the end to say a few things."
"Mr President, Mr CioloÅ, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental reorientation of agricultural policy to focus more on the market economy is the right approach to take."
"The decision to increase the links between European agriculture and the world market is also correct."
"The initial success of this policy was very obvious until 2007 or early 2008."
"European agricultural policy offered better value for money."
"There were hardly any market interventions and farmers had stable, rising incomes."
"However, we are currently seeing the downside of this reorientation which includes large price fluctuations and falling farm incomes."
"Both farmers and agricultural policy makers must be able to accommodate major producer price fluctuations in all areas in future, not just in the dairy sector."
"In order to manage serious falls in the market more effectively, agricultural policy needs tools which allow it to react rapidly, consistently and without a lot of red tape."
"Therefore, I am calling for measures such as interventions or export subsidies not to be abolished altogether but to be included in the budget with a figure of zero."
"These instruments should only be used in exceptional circumstances and not for constant market interventions."
"However, when we need the instruments, they must be ready for use."
"We also need to identify measures for the farming profession which will create equality on the market."
"These include, in particular, strengthening the legal position of producer groups."
"I hope that the Commission will keep its promise to consider better basic legal conditions and then take measures quickly when they are needed in order to prevent farmers and consumers from suffering serious harm."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I support your first steps as Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development because, since your hearing and on several other occasions, we have been pleased to hear you expressing your wishes, as you have understood that the extreme volatility of prices is a serious threat to agriculture and its future."
"The same is true for farmers, who can no longer plan for the long term because, clearly, investments - particularly for the youngest amongst them - are calculated over periods of 20 or 30 years."
"Barely six months ago today I, along with Mr Le Foll and a few other colleagues, signed an amendment on this issue and on serious volatility, which aimed to reduce the 1% increase that had been decided on, in particular, for milk production, since we are, in fact, in a period of overproduction."
"The amendment was rejected by almost 250 votes to 350."
"You said that in the future, we would consider a regulation."
"The high-level group is meeting and its members are, as I understand it, high-calibre individuals: it is not just producers who are represented, but distributors too."
"I would not like the actors who find themselves in between the two, between producers and distributors - namely, processors - to be forgotten."
"I hope that we do not forget them, because it is also and, above all, through them that the profits are made; more so than through the distributors, in my opinion."
"I would like reassurance, then, that they will not be forgotten in the discussion."
"Beyond the dairy sector, all agricultural sectors are being affected by volatility, and I would also be so bold as to say that prices are high."
"Let us be careful; this is not necessarily good for agriculture, as processors - users - are turning to alternative products."
"When prices return to a more normal or lower level, these users will not necessarily return to the original product."
"Commissioner, this being so, I would like to know - even if it is a little premature - if you really do intend in the future to implement, in all other areas of production, the regulatory mechanisms that are keenly awaited by producers."
"Mr President, Mr CioloÅ, things are relatively peaceful at the moment in the countryside, not because farmers are contented, but because many farmers are currently very frustrated."
"We cannot fob all of them off by saying that we will identify the important solution to the agricultural crisis in 2013."
"We need to give them answers now."
"We are in agreement on this."
"The protests could very quickly move back to Brussels, so we have to provide some answers."
"In the dairy sector, a fundamental change in policy is needed."
"I attended the conference of the high level group and found the responses given to the dairy crisis interesting, but by no means adequate."
"If a change in policy has to be made, then the recent decision to remove the regulations must be called into question."
"At the conclusion of this process, we could say that ending quotas resulted in a very hard landing, not a soft one."
"We now urgently need to consider how we can put a new policy in place, how we can set new benchmarks and how we can bring the state, in other words, the European Union, back into the game, to give us clearer rules for the market."
"Markets do not function without assistance."
"That is the answer to the financial crisis and also to the crisis in agriculture."
"We must provide rules."
"We are currently faced by a crazy process of concentration in agriculture."
"I feel very concerned when I read in the paper that units which will accommodate as many as 8 000 cows are being built in the south of England."
"On the other hand, many small farms in disadvantaged regions are having to close."
"These are changes which will not produce a European but an American agricultural model with larger and larger enterprises, which will finally lead to the loss of many small dairy farms in Europe."
"We have to remember that this also means losing jobs."
"Mr Jahr, we agree on one point, even if we do not agree that it is right to focus our agricultural policy on the world market."
"We need a clear legal position for farmers."
"They are the weakest link in the business chain."
"They are the first to be hit by dumping prices, which are becoming increasingly common in many areas."
"We agree that we urgently need a clear policy statement about how we can regulate markets better in future."
"We need to look outside Europe's boundaries to see how other regions are resolving this problem."
"No one will tell us how and when to regulate our markets."
"In recent years, we have taken things too far with the removal of many of the market regulations."
"Let us take a look at other countries - the high level group should do the same - to see what rules are being applied elsewhere."
"It is clear that Canada has what many farmers and many consumers believe is a tried-and-tested model."
"We should not exclude this from the discussion right at the outset."
"Instead, we should also provide some answers."
"As part of the change in the direction of our policy, we must make sure that we put policies in place for regional markets."
"The focus should always be on the regions and not on the 5% of products that are sold on the world market."
"We must not regard export subsidies and interventions as the normal rules for influencing the market in future."
"We must finally put an end to this process."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, I welcome the opportunity to have this debate."
"I think it is very timely, and the recent crisis in the dairy sector, which crippled so many of our farmers across the European Union, certainly demonstrated the serious volatility which can affect our agriculture markets."
"Significant price fluctuations are occurring from year to year, and indeed from month to month, and are often due to factors beyond our control, such as the global financial crisis and, indeed, the price of oil."
"The effects of the dramatic drop in the price of milk in 2009 were compounded by the EU's inability to react swiftly enough to the situation."
"While we were eventually able to implement a mixture of market management and income support measures, such as intervention in the milk fund and export refunds, which eased the pain to a degree, many dairy farmers ended up going out of business and many are suffering serious financial loss."
"In my opinion, we need to adopt a two-fold approach in order to attempt to mitigate the effects of depressed prices on our farmers."
"Firstly, we need to agree upon a set minimum safety net for all sectors which are vulnerable to price fluctuations."
"Secondly, we need to ensure that, whatever tools we introduce, we are able to respond rapidly and effectively to whatever crisis presents itself."
"There is a lot of discussion at the moment in Parliament and beyond about farmers receiving a fair and stable income for what they produce."
"The ins and outs of food supply and the food supply chain in general is a topic which is relevant to both farmers and consumers alike."
"The imminent reform of the CAP gives us a real opportunity to address these issues."
"Of course, it is important not to undermine the competitiveness of Europe's agri-food industry."
"However, a reformed CAP must be able to respond to various crises in agriculture in order to stabilise the markets and ensure a fair income for our farmers."
"(EL) Mr President, I am starting from the assumption that there is a great deal of instability in the agricultural markets."
"There has been a significant drop in the prices of basic agricultural products."
"At the same time, there has been an increase in consumer prices and a substantial reduction in agricultural incomes."
"In my opinion, the CAP, following the reforms and the uncoupling of aid, is sufficiently market-oriented."
"My main proposal - and I wish to make this clear - is that the agricultural sector cannot be left solely to the rules of the market."
"It produces public goods and it needs public European financial support."
"I cannot follow the contradiction in the arguments of members who propose a market orientation here, in countries which maintain, cultivate and step up consumer ethnocentricity, consumer patriotism."
"However, the current market management measures do not provide the necessary safety net, as the previous speaker, Mr Nicholson, said."
"We need supplementary measures, more flexible and effective measures, measures that guarantee market stability in times of crisis."
"Also, in my opinion, we need to 'arm' the CAP with a financial mechanism to deal with crisis situations, a sort of crisis management fund."
"Guaranteeing producers' incomes depends, above all, on safeguarding transparency in the food supply chain."
"To close, we cannot confine ourselves to designing future market tools for after 2013."
"We know that the situation - over and above the milk sector - is also critical in other extremely important sectors, which differ from one geographical area to another within Europe."
"(HU) The debate so far has shown that this is a very complex problem."
"To a certain extent, Mr Tarabella and Mr Nicholson, and others as well, have mentioned that on the one hand, the problem has to do with the food chain as a whole, which the JosÃ© BovÃ© report also addresses, namely, that the European Union has been unable so far to resolve how to bring about a fair balance between producers, processors and retailers."
"As far as Mr CioloÅ is concerned, I agree entirely that it would be good to find a medium- and long-term solution."
"There are four theoretical options."
"One, which Mr Jahr has also mentioned, is to examine the neoliberal standpoint which has so far rejected and tried to dismantle interventionist systems."
"So I agree entirely that we need to think through whether these interventionist systems can be discarded, or whether they can, in fact, be used to regulate the market."
"The second option, proposed by the French Government on the American model, is counter-cyclical regulation."
"The question is whether this is workable in Europe, but we need to examine this, too, since the whole market is so volatile that every option must be considered."
"The third is the stock market option."
"Not long ago, there was a conference on the Borsa Merci Telematica Italiana, an online stock market system, and so we have to examine to what extent the stock exchange systems can be used."
"I would add right away, for Mr CioloÅ' sake, that for Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries, the stock market system is unfortunately not very workable."
"The French Presidency also raised the possibility of creating a European Union price monitoring system."
"We need to think this through as well, and we need to think through - something that, if I am not mistaken, is close to Mr CioloÅ' way of thinking - the possibility of setting up some sort of fund, on the model of the fruit and vegetable reform, which could be used in risk management."
"Unfortunately, in the case of grain, this would require extremely large sums."
"In other words, I agree fully with the Commissioner that we have to think through every option, because at present, the EU is incapable of properly regulating the markets."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as you well know, agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary, if not desirable, in the interests of producers, consumers and the public."
"There are at least three reasons why public intervention in this economic sector is as justifiable in the European Union as it is in other countries of the world."
"The characteristics of supply of agricultural goods and the demand for foodstuffs make agricultural markets unstable."
"Agriculture also produces non-market goods and helps ensure a certain degree of social stability in our countries and our countryside through the jobs that it creates."
"Above all, agriculture is the basis of an abundant, varied and healthy food supply."
"Can we be satisfied, then, with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers?"
"A few days ago, Commissioner, a senior official gave me the following figures for his dÃ©partement - as it happens, this is a French dÃ©partement that you know well, a livestock farming department."
"The administrative centre holds 2 500 agricultural accounts."
"Of those, 800 have a debt ratio in excess of 80%, and 20% have a debt ratio of 100% or more."
"Faced with such figures - which, I admit, surprised even me - the issue to be dealt with today is not just one of revenue but of the decapitalisation of European agriculture."
"Less aid, less public intervention and more restrictions on production: that is a truly explosive combination."
"It is true that the general economic crisis is aggravating the situation."
"However, we must also question certain decisions taken by the Commission, certain decisions taken by your colleagues, Commissioner."
"Agriculture remains a bargaining chip in trade agreements."
"Despite the situation in Europe, meat, certain cereals, fruits and vegetables are all affected."
"The recent agreement between the European Union and the Andean countries, in particular, Peru and Colombia, will sacrifice the producers of the outermost regions."
"We cannot continue with such a policy."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I come from southern Italy."
"In my region, in our regions, production revolves around Mediterranean crops, oil, arable crops and vegetables."
"Little has been said about this, as the focus of Europe and of the Commission has always been predominantly on dairy farming and stock rearing; yet we also need to draw attention to Mediterranean crops."
"I assure you that we are witnessing a phenomenon of rural abandonment in our areas, in our regions, due to the effects of climate change and desertification."
"For us, desertification manifests itself in the weeds that grow where vegetable crops, vegetables and fruits, were once cultivated, where olive groves are no longer nurtured and the soil is no longer ploughed."
"I can tell you that in 1995, before the euro came along, olive producers were paid ITL 170 000, which is equivalent to about EUR 90."
"This year, olive producers have been paid EUR 30 per hundred kilograms."
"Thirteen or fourteen years have gone by and the price is now a third of what it used to be."
"Our producers sell oil wholesale for EUR 2 per litre; such takings do not even allow them to cover their costs, and we are putting farms in debt because they are selling at less than cost price."
"We are also seeing a strange phenomenon: oil is bought wholesale for EUR 2 and we find that it is retailing in supermarkets for EUR 2 or less."
"There is clearly a need to introduce more controls."
"I would be happy to meet you to outline the problem of updating Regulation (EC) No 2568/1991; there are new control systems and we must fight against sophistication and adulteration, for the benefit of consumers and producers too."
"We cannot contemplate nationalising aid in the next CAP, nor can we contemplate reducing direct aid, since the absence of direct aid or the reduction of its funds would lead to a farming crisis in southern Italy and the Mediterranean."
"Commissioner, I will conclude by telling you that those who own land today own it not because they won it in a lottery, but because it was handed down to them by their father or grandfather, who cultivated that land, who poured their sweat and blood into it, and left it to their son."
"Today, those who leave their farm to their children risk leaving them with a handful of debts."
"Europe must provide an energetic and strong response to help and aid the revival of our agricultural sector."
"(FI) Mr President, stabilising the market must be one of the shared central objectives of economic policy."
"On this matter, we in this Chamber seem to be of the same opinion."
"In the common agricultural policy, we need the safety net of market measures, both for the protection of farmers and also for the protection of all those who are involved in the food chain."
"The period after 2013 seems particularly alarming, for example, because of the withdrawal of export subsidies and milk quotas, as well as the increase in imports from other countries."
"It therefore seems good that the Commissioner is saying at this stage that he plans to take measures before 2013."
"Now we need to examine how we will be able to put the new administrative tools for the market into use: for example, the many different measures for developing an income insurance system, making producers and businesses stronger and improving the transparency of the market."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr CioloÅ, I have in front of me an analysis of the economic situation in the German agricultural sector."
"The analysis involved the evaluation of 19 100 sets of accounts from full-time and part-time farms."
"The results have been projected on the basis of the distribution of farms from the Farm Structure Survey of 2007."
"In the financial year 2008-2009, the overall situation deteriorated significantly."
"The figures for the 18 200 full-time dairy and arable farms fell from EUR 45 400 to EUR 34 400."
"That represents a reduction of 24%."
"Particularly large losses occurred in 2008-2009."
"Operating results fell to EUR 29 300 (minus 45%) and to EUR 43 000 (minus 18%)."
"In contrast, mixed livestock farms ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I think that the debate that we have just heard demonstrates the extent to which we should learn lessons from this dairy crisis."
"Moreover, as Mr Le Foll said at the start of his speech, we should consider implementing mechanisms for regulating the markets as part of the common agricultural policy post-2013."
"I firmly believe that the CAP must be able, at the same time as respecting the diversity of European agriculture, to propose measures relating to our common objectives at European level that will allow us to fulfil the role granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In other words, it must guarantee the stability of farmers' revenues and ensure that the markets are well supplied."
"The future instruments of the CAP should therefore make it possible for us to achieve, among other things, these objectives."
"There are other objectives of course, but those are the fundamental ones that we must take into account."
"Measures to regulate the markets that will enable us to avoid situations of price or market volatility or to intervene in such situations will be the focus of our concerns and of the proposals that the Commission will make as part of the CAP post-2013."
"I can assure you that we are currently working on this."
"I am firmly convinced and conscious of the fact that market management mechanisms must be able to play a role alongside direct aid, which we must keep, albeit by adapting the criteria for awarding them."
"The market must be able to function, of course."
"We must leave the market to function when it is able, but I also agree with Mr Dantin when he says that the specific nature of the agricultural sector justifies public intervention."
"This must, of course, be targeted and must aim to solve problems with the functioning of the market and to ensure that it functions properly."
"It is in this spirit that we will be making proposals for the CAP post-2013."
"I fully understand that sectors other than dairy are also experiencing difficulties at this time."
"Thus, the fruit and vegetables sector is also often subjected to major market variations: variations in price and amounts marketed or sold."
"This sector underwent reform a few years ago."
"We will also learn lessons from how that reform, which gave greater negotiating powers to producers within producer organisations, was applied."
"I think that, at this level too, we could learn some lessons that could be applied to other sectors."
"Indeed, I am of the view that, apart from public intervention, producers must also be given the opportunity to negotiate contracts better and thus to negotiate prices better, whilst ensuring some stability in what products are placed on the market by means of private contracts."
"I therefore think that, in addition to public intervention, we can find other ways of allowing the market to function well, whilst giving the public authorities the power to intervene when the market is unable to play its role, since agriculture must not only supply the markets, but also continue to produce public goods."
"We are in agreement on that."
"Therefore, in order for agriculture to be able to fulfil all of its functions, we will have to help it."
"As for issues relating to the food chain, in particular, the powers to negotiate a better distribution of added value, Parliament has carried out some work, the Commission has issued a communication and debates have taken place within the Council."
"On the basis of all these elements, I think that we will make some proposals in order to find mechanisms that will allow producers to negotiate their margins better."
"I think that I have more or less covered all the speeches and all the problems that were raised."
"I would like to thank you once again for the opportunity that you have given me to explain myself."
"The debate is only just beginning."
"I also launched a public debate before making proposals on the CAP post-2013 reform."
"I think that following that debate and the work under way within Parliament, we shall be able, between now and the autumn, when I shall return with a Commission communication on the future of the CAP, to make proposals that will give farmers greater confidence in their activities."
"We need these farmers, not only for what they supply on the market, but also for what they do on their land."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"There has been a fall in prices in various agricultural markets in recent months as a result of the economic and financial crisis that has affected the EU, which, in turn, has affected demand for those products."
"Lower prices benefit consumers and, in the medium term, will lead to increased demand, but in the meantime, many producers are being badly hit."
"It is therefore crucial to draw up a European agricultural policy that will respond to the key issue: the need to ensure sustainable food security at reasonable market prices."
"What is required is an agricultural model that is competitive and economically viable and which responds to the citizens' food, environmental and social needs."
"Even if the common agricultural policy is market oriented, it has to contain a series of instruments to address the need to compensate for the production of public assets that the market does not remunerate and to control the extreme volatility of the market."
"It must also have appropriate regulation, a strong safety net and sensible risk management."
"It also needs to improve the food supply chain, by means of greater transparency and better contractual practices that are not damaging for producers."
"To conclude, it is essential to ensure equality of treatment for imported agricultural materials and produce."
"in writing. - Firstly, let me say that I welcome the moves of my colleagues, especially Senor de Castro, who has taken the initiative to start the debate on this issue."
"It is a fact that today, our farmers are faced with overwhelming obstacles when it comes to achieving a fair price for their produce."
"The effect on prices during the recent dairy crisis is just one example."
"Stock intervention had its role to play in stabilising the market, as did the Emergency Dairy Fund. But we are not out of the woods yet, so to speak."
"Supermarkets present their hurdles when it comes to a fair deal for farmers."
"We all know how the average supermarket likes to present itself to the consumer as a 'slasher' of prices."
"We need to be careful however, that the supermarket does not also continue slashing the prices going to our farmers."
"If the current system was allowed to continue indefinitely, there would be no incentive to farm and where would our rural society be then."
"This has to change."
"I hope the Commission is as concerned about this as Members of Parliament are."
"In 2009, European farmers experienced significant difficulties."
"Incomes fell by almost a quarter, and the crisis affected the majority of agricultural markets, including milk, cereals, pork, beef, olives, etc. The most difficult situation was definitely that facing the dairy market."
"As a result of a worldwide price collapse, European milk producers suffered huge losses."
"Farmers publicised their difficult situation at a variety of meetings, and there were also mass protests of farmers in many countries."
"Currently, price fluctuations are no longer so large, but this does not mean the problems have disappeared."
"We are still faced with low demand and price fluctuations in many sectors of agriculture."
"The present mechanisms of intervention in the dairy sector and the establishment of the Dairy Fund are proving insufficient."
"We can already imagine what will happen when these instruments expire."
"We can certainly expect further falls in income and market turbulence."
"I agree with the statement of Mr CioloÅ that the difficult situation in the dairy market should be solved immediately, and that we should not wait for 2013, when a major reform of the CAP is planned."
"In June, we expect a decision of the High Level Group, which will present its reflections and thoughts on improvement of the situation in the dairy sector."
"I hope that body will fulfil our expectations and present a balanced programme of stabilising measures."
"I am pleased that Mr CioloÅ shares our fears and has taken account of our suggestions."

"2008 Discharge (debate)"
"(FR) Mr President, I note that the Court of Auditors is absent from this House."
"We need the position of the Court of Auditors to make matters clearer for us."
"Do we have an explanation for this absence?"
"I also note that the Council's seats are empty, even though we are going to be dealing with discharge to the Council, about which we have a number of concerns."
"Do we also have an explanation for the Council's absence?"
"Colleagues, it is not necessary for the Council to be here."
"They are not obliged to be here, but we did of course expect the Court of Auditors' highest representatives."
"They are not here and we are very surprised, as it is certainly not a problem of transport."
"It is not so far from Luxembourg and they can travel by car without any problem."
"Nevertheless we should start our discussion, not knowing yet why they have not arrived."
"We will start the discussion without them."
"We know that the votes are postponed and will be held in two weeks' time in Brussels."
"We have already decided about that."
"So there is only one possibility for us: we have to start the discussion, not knowing whether they will be able to be here in the next half-hour or hour."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to say to you that, without knowing the reason why, we understand that the Court of Auditors is absent, that it does an outstanding job of auditing the European institutions."
"I do, however, object to the Council's absence because we need debates with it, particularly where discharges relating to its activities are concerned."
"Therefore, I object to the Council's absence today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can, in any case, begin the discussion."
"What is important is that we can start our work."
"Mr President, I would like to mention that we should not only be blaming the Council."
"The Secretary-General of Parliament is missing."
"The discharge has something to say to the Secretary-General about Parliament, so we would be extremely happy if he were with us today as well."
"I am sure the Secretary-General will be here - there is no doubt about that."
"Good morning Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I would like to repeat that, in my opinion, it is rather difficult to conduct a debate in the absence of those to whom we are supposed to grant discharge, with whom we want to discuss the reasons why we are granting discharge or are postponing discharge or whatever else we have to talk to them about."
"I know many of the honourable Members of this House from the committee."
"We also know our respective positions."
"It is fine that we will exchange them once again this morning, but it is not really helpful."
"In this context, I would like to propose that in committee, we deliberate formally inviting the institutions we are discussing to the next discharge debate and postponing the debates accordingly if they are not present."
"Discharge to the European institutions comes at a difficult, but important moment."
"A consequence of the financial crisis is that all governments are having to review their respective budgets and ensure that they are meeting their requirements."
"We are in the first year of a new legislative period of the European Parliament and are dealing with a newly assembled Commission."
"In terms of the discharge, we are, however, considering the 2008 budget, which was under the responsibility of the previous Commission."
"This opens a multitude of new perspectives."
"Among these new perspectives, we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the Member States since, for the first time, the Treaty of Lisbon names them as being co-responsible for the implementation of the EU budget."
"In terms of the 2008 budgetary review, it was the rapporteur's intention to ensure that the Commission concentrates entirely on possibilities for improvement in budgetary control and that the Member States are on board for that as well."
"As the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control, it is our goal that in future, every discharge report - on the basis of the judgment of the European Court of Auditors - is better than the previous one."
"It all depends on the Council assuming its new key roll in the light of the importance of the Member States."
"It would be equally helpful if the European Court of Auditors looked for ways of redressing the imbalance that is, on the one hand, the result of annual reporting and the multiannual duration of many EU programmes and the logic of their implementation by the Commission and the Member States."
"As the budgetary authority, we continue to have great concerns regarding some specific areas of responsibility, and, in particular, those in which the EU intends to implement its political priorities."
"For example, cohesion in the European Union is essential and therefore, the funds that flow into structural policy are particularly important."
"Here, we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid."
"We need finer instruments to measure results and we call on the Court of Auditors to develop these instruments, in order to be able to identify precisely the sources of errors."
"We know that the action plan for the structural funds that provides for recovery is finally being implemented and we must now wait for it to have an effect."
"Pre-accession aid has the goal of enabling fundamental processes of change in these states and problems in target setting and implementation must be remedied."
"What will not do, however, is the fact that the goal of the accession process is effectively being torpedoed through the back door."
"Therefore, I call on the House to reject the attempt by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to use amendments to turn the position of the European Parliament on Turkey's accession process on its head, as recorded in the resolution on the progress report."
"We are looking forward to the appointment of a new Director-General of the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) to end the ongoing debate, and also the Commission's proposals on the reform of OLAF, in order to improve the crucial work of this office."
"Finally, to external policy actions."
"We need a demonstration of the determination of the EU to contribute to the resolution of problems worldwide."
"These actions must be highly effective, even under the most difficult circumstances."
"In the coming months, we must discuss the current management of EU funds in this area with the Commission and how these funds will be managed in future by the European External Action Service."
"We are, however, making some progress."
"Our group is particularly pleased with the steps the Commission is taking as regards the annual management reports of the Member States, for example, since we are thereby getting closer to the realisation of an old demand of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats."
"The same is true for the financial corrections and recoveries, since this is also an opportunity to reduce an unacceptably high rate of errors."
"These points give us, among other things, the opportunity, some considerations notwithstanding, to call for the discharge of the Commission."
"I thank you and look forward to your comments."
"Mr President, we have here today an important task to perform for the discharge of the Seventh, Eighth and Ninth European Development Funds (EDFs) and the part of the Tenth EDF corresponding to 2008."
"This is, moreover, a critical time, when major institutional changes are taking place and also when various global disasters have shown that European aid is increasingly important."
"They have also shown that it needs to be coordinated, it needs to be effective and, above all, it needs to be transparent, so that all Europeans continue to maintain their support and their positive view of this aid."
"In addition, this is a crucial time in institutional terms."
"The implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, as well as the European External Action Service, provide us with a dual opportunity."
"On the one hand, we have the chance to improve substantially the application and effectiveness of our external aid; on the other, however, there are also major question marks, because we are concerned at the high risk that the growing effectiveness that we have achieved with difficulty for European development aid, in conjunction with the Court of Auditors and the Commission, may be undermined by further reorganisation, ambiguity in decision making and the chain of responsibility, and, especially, by fragmented management."
"We need greater certainty from the Commission to avoid such setbacks, and therefore we need clear, specific information as soon as possible on what the new system will be like and how it will affect development aid."
"First, with regard to the current financial year, I would like to express the need for the EDF to be fully incorporated into the budget - that, I repeat again, is our demand - in order to enhance its consistency, transparency and effectiveness and to strengthen its oversight system."
"We therefore insist that it is vital for the Commission, together with Parliament, to keep this demand firmly in mind for the next financial framework."
"It is also important to strengthen joint planning so as to achieve greater concentration, coordination and vision in the work."
"Consequently, we need to focus the Tenth EDF on a limited number of sectors."
"It is important to avoid the adverse effects of proliferation, although we must be very careful not to underestimate the capacity and effectiveness of non-governmental organisations on the ground, as they are effective."
"It is a complex exercise in squaring the circle, but we hope that we can take it forward, together with the Commission."
"We are also pleased that in this financial year, the statement of assurance has been positive, except for the method of estimating the provision for the Commission's costs."
"Then there are no material errors in the underlying transactions, although we are still finding - and therefore need to improve - a high incidence of non-quantifiable errors in both budget-support commitments and payments."
"We are also hugely concerned that the Court of Auditors has again been unable to obtain important documentation on payments amounting to 6.7% of annual expenditure relating to cooperation with international organisations."
"We need a definitive method and an ad hoc calendar to ensure that information and documentation on this joint financing is not undermined by this lack of transparency."
"In addition, we consider financial implementation to have been satisfactory, since the Seventh EDF has been closed and its balance transferred to the Ninth EDF."
"We also welcome the speedy implementation of the Tenth EDF since 1 July 2008, and we hope that the Commission's efforts will culminate in the settlement of the remaining old and dormant payments."
"Resources are another of the important items."
"We are also concerned, although there has been some discussion, that the resources of the Ninth and Tenth EDFs managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) are not covered by the statement of assurance and should therefore be the subject of regular reports by the EIB."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been asking myself what discharge really is."
"Discharge is a parliamentary procedure, a public procedure; it is a critical scrutiny, in public, of financial management."
"I was responsible for carrying out this exercise in respect of the European Parliament for the 2008 financial year."
"This scrutiny facilitates MEPs' and also citizens' understanding of Parliament's particular set-up, governance structure and working methods."
"After all, ladies and gentlemen, citizens have the right to know what is happening to their taxes."
"A great deal of money is involved."
"We are talking about a parliamentary budget of EUR 1.4 billion for 2008; the budget for 2011 is likely to be EUR 1.7 billion."
"This is an extremely large amount of money."
"The procedure is important, as is the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"After all, a critical approach by this committee ensures progress, as has indeed been demonstrated in the past."
"For example, a critical stance by the Committee on Budgetary Control ensured the introduction of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament and of a Statute for Assistants, it ensured that we carried out a critical examination of the purchase of buildings here in Strasbourg, and it ensured the accomplishment of an EMAS procedure that has reduced the environmental impact of our work."
"This is all good news, ladies and gentlemen."
"Thanks to our critical stance, we have managed to reduce electricity consumption by 25% over three years."
"We have managed to use 100% green electricity."
"We have succeeded in cutting CO2 emissions by 17%."
"We have managed to reduce, compost or reuse 50% of our waste streams."
"My report also introduces a new concept: that of 'reputational damage' to Parliament."
"This means that even the smallest impact of financial resources can cause enormous damage to the reputation of this House."
"We should be alert to this."
"The appointment of a risk manager within the administration on 24 February is to be warmly welcomed."
"I would invite that person to approach the competent committees and join us in discussing ways of reducing the risks of misappropriation in this House."
"A critical approach is essential, as I have said."
"That is why I am calling for transparency and openness, for the establishment of a system of checks and balances, and for responsibility and accountability."
"Mr President, I propose granting you discharge, as I have not discovered any serious cases of fraud or misappropriation or any major scandals: let that be quite clear."
"Nevertheless, my report is critical."
"I wanted to show that we can do even better."
"The report aims to ensure that, as we approach the next elections in 2014, we are free from all scandals, big or small, and that we are not plagued by that kind of unsavoury report in the press."
"In my report, I have endeavoured to hand the Secretary-General and Parliament's senior administration a number of means of protection against certain criticisms."
"I have discussed a number of concerns."
"One is the fact that the Secretary-General draws up his annual report on the basis of declarations by the Directors-General, when I should much prefer there to be a second opinion."
"I propose we take an even closer look at the whole difficult system of public procurement, as this constitutes a major risk factor."
"I propose ensuring that no public taxes are used for the voluntary pension fund, with its actuarial deficit of EUR 121 million."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude with a few words about the production of my report."
"I strove for positive cooperation with my shadow rapporteurs, and some very constructive amendments have been tabled."
"However, I regret that, at some point, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) tabled a mere 50 or so amendments seeking to delete important parts of my report."
"I can only think that there has been some interference between certain of Parliament's structures and the MEPs who wanted to do that."
"I find this regrettable in that, as a pro-European yet critical MEP, I sought primarily to present a very constructive, very positive approach in this discharge report."
"Mr President, Mr Å emeta, it has to be said that in all the institutions with which I have been involved - the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, which is absent today, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor - there has generally been a significant improvement, but this does not mean that everything is ideal."
"Let us say frankly that the situation is least transparent with the finances of the Council."
"Moreover, cooperation with the Council on the matter of budget discharge leaves a great deal to be desired."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has endorsed my proposal to postpone a decision on granting the Council's Secretary-General discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008."
"The situation is analogous to the one from last year."
"The Coordinators of the Committee on Budgetary Control met the representatives of the Spanish Presidency's Council assuming a positive view should be taken of the progress on cooperation which was made last year and which resulted from the protracted discharge procedure."
"This year, unfortunately, the answers given to the questions put by myself and the coordinators were completely unsatisfactory and gave rise to a great many doubts."
"For this reason, and with the support of the coordinators of all the political groups, I have decided to postpone the decision on discharge."
"Matters relating to the financing of various aspects of common foreign policy and security, annual financial reports and the closing of extra-budgetary accounts still remain unclear."
"A definite improvement must be made on the matters of verification of invoices and publication of administrative decisions used as the legal basis for budgetary items."
"In addition, it is paradoxical that much of the data presented by the Council concerned the former budgetary period."
"As for the Court of Justice, we can discern certain weaknesses in internal tender procurement procedures, as can the Court of Auditors."
"In relation to this, we support the suggestion of the Court of Auditors concerning the need to improve tender procedures in this institution."
"We are pleased about the reduction in the duration of proceedings but, on the other hand, we have observed a persistent backlog of cases."
"We are pleased to note the opening of the Internal Audit Unit."
"We welcome the practice of including in the activity report information on progress made in relation to the discharge of the year before."
"I stress very strongly that we regret the permanent reluctance of the ECJ to publish its members' declarations of financial interests."
"As for the Court of Auditors, the external audit did not give grounds to state that the financial resources assigned to the Court are being used improperly."
"I repeat the suggestion to consider the possibility of rationalising the structure of the Court, for example, by capping the number of members and not treating the Court of Auditors as a specific kind of political group."
"In the case of the Economic and Social Committee, the audit conducted by the Court of Auditors did not reveal any serious improprieties."
"It should be recommended that provisions concerning financial aspects of staff be interpreted and implemented by all EU institutions in the same way, so that the staff of none of the institutions are treated in a more privileged way."
"It is very good that the Administrative Cooperation Agreement between the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions has been adopted."
"We encourage both institutions to communicate the progress made as regards harmonising their internal control standards."
"We do not have any serious reservations concerning the Committee of the Regions or the European Ombudsman."
"We note that the European Ombudsman has greatly increased its number of posts."
"The question is whether it should increase the number of posts at this pace, although it does also have more work."
"To sum up, there is only a problem with the Council."
"There are no problems with the other six institutions."
"We must keep to the allotted time."
"I have some information."
"We have had contact with the head of cabinet of the President of the Court of Auditors, and we also checked our last debates at the European Parliament in 2008 and 2009."
"The Court of Auditors was not present during our discussions and neither was the Council."
"The Court of Auditors and the Council were not present during our discussions."
"Mr Caldeira, the President of the Court of Auditors, also remarked that the position of the Court in its technical functions is to attend the Budgetary Control Committee meeting, but to stay in the background in political debates at plenary."
"President Caldeira will contact me during the day and explain the position of the Court of Auditors on our discussions."
"We checked for the last two years and the Court of Auditors was not present."
"If we want to organise it for the next time, they could maybe be present next year."
"They were, of course, informed about our meeting, but were not present over the last two years."
"They will certainly be present in October and November when they will present their report."
"(NL) Mr President, I can fully accept that the European Court of Auditors is not here today, but what you have just said about the Council's absence, including in recent years, merely demonstrates that this is a structural rather than an occasional problem."
"This is typical of the Council's behaviour when it comes to the responsible use of European funds and, in actual fact, your message only serves to cast the Council's absence in an even worse light."
"For this reason, and as a crystal clear signal from Parliament to the Council, I wish to propose that we postpone today's debate on the Council's discharge and refrain from discussing that subject today."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your careful presentation of the facts concerning previous years."
"However, I would like to underline very firmly that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, and this increases the European Parliament's role."
"In relation to this, we are entitled to expect, for reasons which are not so much formal as practical and political, that representatives of the Council, as the previous speaker has just said, should be present during this extremely important debate, a debate which is perhaps the most important one from the point of view of European taxpayers and European electors."
"The absence of the Council is a complete misunderstanding, and I am inclined to agree with the proposal of the previous speaker that in this situation, we should postpone the part of the debate which concerns the Council and wait until representatives of the Council get here."
"I stress yet again what I said earlier, that the Council did not show the will to work constructively with us as representatives of the Committee on Budgetary Control or as coordinators from the Committee, and today's absence would appear to be another element of that lack of cooperation."
"Mr President, when we go through the discharge procedure and vote on it, the European Parliament will take full responsibility for the year 2008."
"This is the moment when we take the responsibility from the Commission, the Council and other institutions onto our shoulders."
"It is not only a formality but a very important moment."
"However, I think that we have agreed that we will continue the debate and we will go on."
"Do not forget we have an objective reason, namely, that it is not so easy to arrive here from Spain."
"I know this because I came from Azerbaijan, through Baku and Madrid and then by road."
"I am very aware that today is not the right day to pursue this."
"I think it is enough for us to ask those institutions and the others which are involved in the discharge to show an interest and be present at the vote in May."
"That is what I would suggest."
"(FR) Mr President, we are used to the Council's seats being empty."
"It is therefore not the first time; let us not be hypocritical."
"Once again, I find this regrettable."
"As regards the debate, I am in favour of it going ahead."
"Moreover, subject to your administration's assessment, I do not think we have the power to amend the agenda, since it was set on your authority when you resumed the plenary session."
"Therefore, I am in favour of the debate going ahead, albeit voicing my regret once again that the Council is absent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will contact both the Court of Auditors and the Council today."
"I will present our expectations for the future in relation to the Council and the Court of Auditors very firmly, and say that they should be present at such meetings."
"I will also speak to Mr Zapatero in person about this, because he leads the rotating Presidency."
"I will, today, find a solution to this for the future."
"Mr President, Mr Å emeta, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, I am very pleased to see you and to address you - welcome."
"In the period 2000-2010, we have seen a 610% increase in EU contributions to the decentralised agencies."
"The contributions have increased from EUR 95 to 579 million, even though the staff numbers of those agencies increased by around 271%."
"In 2000, the agencies employed 1 219 people, whereas, today, they employ 4 794."
"These figures do not take into account the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was closed in 2008, and on the last discharge of which we will vote today, or rather at a later date in Brussels."
"This general increase is certainly impressive."
"Nonetheless, in the period 2000-2010, the European Union has had to face many challenges."
"Firstly, two enlargements, in 2004 and 2007, with 12 new Member States, and other challenges such as employment and vocational training, immigration, the environment, air safety and many others still."
"In this context, the decentralised agencies that were set up to respond to a specific need make a direct contribution, through the skills they develop, to the European Union's progress in the face of these huge challenges."
"Similarly, the Member States must cooperate closely on these issues, and the agencies are a powerful vehicle for these exchanges."
"Lastly, establishing the agencies throughout EU territory makes Europe closer to its citizens and permits a certain degree of decentralisation of EU activities."
"The scope of the tasks entrusted to the agencies and the increase in their number, size and budgets does, however, require the institutions to fulfil their own budgetary authority responsibilities."
"The budgetary control remit of Parliament, like that of the Internal Audit Service of the Commission and of the Court of Auditors, must also be strengthened to ensure that these agencies are monitored properly."
"However, that does not exempt them from having to comply with the rules in force."
"With regard to the 2008 discharge, I would point out here what are, unfortunately, recurring problems facing many agencies: the weaknesses in procurement procedures; the unrealistic recruitment planning and the lack of transparency in the procedures for selecting their personnel; the large volume of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations; and the weaknesses in the scheduling of activities, with a lack of specific objectives."
"We note that, despite the agencies' efforts, some of them still have difficulty in applying EU financial and budgetary regulations, not least because of their size."
"The smallest agencies have more difficulty in following the onerous procedures imposed by EU legislation."
"On this point, I expect the swift conclusions of the interinstitutional working group to ensure that the same problems are not repeated year after year."
"Nevertheless, these difficulties do not jeopardise the granting of discharge for the financial year 2008."
"The situation is different for the European Police College (CEPOL)."
"Although one may note some improvements in the management of CEPOL when compared with the situation in 2007, the audits carried out reveal some blatant irregularities in the application of the administrative and financial rules."
"That is why we are proposing that discharge be postponed."
"To conclude, I should like to highlight the efforts made by some agencies to improve their management."
"Some have taken it upon themselves to go further and have introduced rules that are worthy of praise, and I shall mention just a few of them."
"The European Food Safety Authority, which I would add was very effective in its agency coordination role, has introduced a risk assessment process."
"The European Environment Agency has implemented a management control system for monitoring the progress of its projects and the use of its resources in real time."
"Lastly, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has created a system for monitoring the information it provides."
"To conclude, I do, of course, encourage the agencies to follow this example."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, allow me to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Liberadzki, and his fellow rapporteurs on the reports they have produced and for the recommendations to grant the discharge to the Commission for the 2008 financial year."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her report on the implementation of the European Development Fund and Mrs Mathieu for her comprehensive analysis of recurrent issues for agencies."
"The 2008 discharge procedure is now reaching its end."
"It was an intensive period but, most importantly, the start of a new constructive dialogue between our institutions."
"Achieving an unqualified statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors remains the Commission's collegial objective."
"I believe this has been clearly demonstrated in our recent efforts."
"Progress is already under way, with simplifications introduced and better management and control systems under the 2007-13 programming period and the various action plans gradually showing their positive impact on the error rates."
"A substantial step change will be possible with a new generation of programmes for the next financial period currently under preparation; these should aim at better balancing targeted eligibility criteria, cost of control and quality of spending."
"However, with my fellow Commissioners, I share the wish expressed in your discharge resolution: we want to see, soon, a measurable acceleration of the progress made over the last years in improving the financial management of the European budget, including the reinforcement of the main stakeholders' responsibility and accountability."
"Close and intense cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament is instrumental in this respect."
"However, we all know that it will not be sufficient to accelerate concrete and sustainable progress on the spot."
"In order to succeed, we need a new partnership with all stakeholders, not least the active involvement of the Member States and the European Court of Auditors."
"The Commission will not wait until the amendments to the Financial Regulation enter into force to invite the Member States' authorities to fully resume their responsibilities as reinforced under the Lisbon Treaty, anticipating measures which are essential to improving financial management."
"I also consider that the Court of Auditors has a crucial role in expressing its independent assurance statement on the Commission's financial management."
"Any change in the splitting of the DAS by area would change the share of the budget associated with the different colour areas."
"The Commission would very much welcome it if, in the near future, the Court of Auditors were to consider a distinction between areas where the risk of error is different and informs us about the actual added value of the management and control systems introduced in the 2007-13 legislation."
"I hope as well that, when the colegislator has agreed on a tolerable risk of error, the Court of Auditors will consider this new concept in the way it finds appropriate."
"As requested, the Commission will prepare and send to the Parliament a new agenda for 2010 onwards."
"The Commission will do its utmost, together with the other actors involved, to accelerate the reduction of error rates so as to ensure that a further 20% of the budget can be given a green classification by the European Court of Auditors in 2014."
"The involvement of all stakeholders in the common objective of improving financial management and protecting the Union's financial interests will be at the heart of this new agenda, which I will share with you already next month."
"Your considerations expressed in the 2008 discharge resolution will be duly taken into account."
"I am looking forward to constructive discussions."
"Mr President, in the financial year 2008, payments to the tune of around EUR 5 billion were made in areas of policy that the Committee on Foreign Affairs is responsible for."
"In retrospect, the continued underfunding of category IV is clear."
"The Court of Auditors established some inaccuracies and considers the Commission's supervision and control system for external aid, development aid and pre-accession aid only partially effective."
"The Commission refers to the specific, purely annual approach of the Court of Auditors that can only ever evaluate part of the Commission's work and claims the reason lies in the multiannual character of most programmes and their related control systems."
"The important thing in my view is that the Court of Auditors is not talking about fraud or embezzlement."
"It is much more about handling the EU's external aid carefully, promptly and as effectively as possible, as well as about detailed documentation and accountability, since it is annoying when projects are not completed on time or there is a lack of clarity about their outcome."
"It jeopardises the success of our foreign policy."
"The fact that the Court of Auditors has established that error rates are in decline is therefore praise for the work of the previous Commission in external aid, in development cooperation and in enlargement policy."
"Obviously, amendments to the legal framework are also beginning to have an impact."
"The special report on pre-accession aid for Turkey provides the first references to improved control of the use of funds that has become possible since 2007 through the new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance."
"Future accounts reports and reviews must indicate how responsibly and successfully recipients handle EU aid."
"We must be able to adapt our foreign policy flexibly, so that we can defend our external policy interests effectively."
"We therefore call on the Commission to proceed with the improvement of financial regulation, the new financial framework, budget reform and, above all, with the development of the European External Action Service."
"All in all, I can, however, recommend discharge for the financial year 2008 for the area of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have already had an interesting morning together."
"Actually, I wanted to make a completely different speech."
"I will not do this now because I believe that we cannot simply ignore what happened today."
"We are dealing with the fact that neither this House nor the other institutions are taking discharge seriously in any form."
"The only institution that has to take it seriously is the Commission."
"It is the one we are talking to and is the one that is subject to discharge in the treaty."
"For all others, namely the other institutions, the matter of discharge has not been regulated in the treaty."
"That is a problem for us."
"Now we must imagine how, in two years, the European External Action Service may not sit here if it becomes an institution."
"Then we will experience what we already have now, namely, that all other institutions do not even feel it necessary to appear here and listen to what the Parliament as budget legislator has to say to them."
"The Council is now making this year a commendable exception, as the Swedish Presidency did last year."
"If we take what is happening here as a fundamental parliamentary right as a basis for discharge, then I can only warn you not to put the proposal currently on the table into action, namely to transform the European External Action Service into another institution, because that would herald the end of our influence, because it is so easy to escape this influence."
"The only other institution that is represented is Parliament."
"I would like to offer the President of Parliament my particular thanks for defending our rights this morning and for indicating that he will enter into talks with all of the others."
"What is the use in us having a discharge right if we do not take it seriously and if we do not compel others to take it seriously? Therefore, we must consider the discharge procedure itself very thoroughly."
"We cannot go on as we have up to now."
"I would like to seize the initiative and turn once again to the Council."
"Following the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council is now one institution and the President of the Council is one institution."
"We expect the immediate legalisation of this state of affairs in budgetary legislation."
"You yourselves must ensure the proper anchoring of your own responsibility in budgetary law, and this even applies to the President of the Council."
"You must legalise your responsibilities and I call on you to do this as a matter of urgency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to address one point, a point that really is a scandal."
"I am talking about the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the ECDC in Stockholm."
"Since May 2005, highly qualified people there have had to work in an absolutely hostile environment."
"Until now, the Swedish Government has been unable to conclude an accord de siege with the ECDC, although they desperately wanted this agency, like all Member States always badly want an agency."
"To this day, none of the employees have a personal identity number, the so-called FolkbokfÃ¶ring number."
"However, this number is used by public administrations, institutions and private companies to identify their customers."
"Consequently, children born in Sweden cannot be registered, for example, providers of electricity, gas, telecommunications and television withhold their services, landlords refuse long-term tenancy agreements and there are problems accessing doctors and hospitals."
"For spouses, it means it is impossible to become self-employed in Sweden."
"There are also enormous difficulties in getting a job."
"The list could go on."
"One thing is clear: certain fundamental rights anchored in European law are simply being denied to the staff at the ECDC in Sweden."
"As a result, all of this has landed before our Committee on Petitions."
"In any case, the situation is untenable ...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) Mr President, there is not much left to say about the 2008 budget of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection; the discussion in committee and in the reports has already shed a good deal of light on matters."
"We saw a rather substantial under-execution with regard to Solvit in 2008, but this will correct itself in 2009 and 2010."
"Nevertheless, I would urge the Commissioner to simply ensure that the budget for Solvit is used sensibly."
"I understand that budgets have to be spent responsibly, but I see now that the provision of information in this field is still insufficient."
"Following on from this, perhaps I could just make an observation on the Services Directive, which was introduced in December 2009."
"There is simply a great need for information on this directive in the European Union."
"Mr President, another point concerns actual customs checks by Member States."
"This is not exactly a subject that needs to be discussed here, but we have seen that Member States are not carrying out enough checks on imported goods, and I would make a renewed appeal to the Commission to get together with the Member States to give this further consideration, so as to ensure that goods imports are properly checked without fail."
"Finally, as several of my fellow Members and the Commissioner himself have already remarked, the budgetary rules are still very complicated on a number of points, which also means that the associated control mechanisms are very complicated."
"Therefore, I wish to add my voice to all the calls for these to be simplified, and, at all events, improved."
"Mr President, I ask you to treat the first part just as a point of order, because I would like to know before the end of this debate whether Parliament invited both the Court of Auditors and the Council to attend this debate, and I would like to know about or receive the documentation."
"I would also like to know whether last year - although Mrs GrÃ¤Ãle has said that the Swedish Presidency was present here - the Council was at the discharge debate."
"Would you now please start the clock for my speech on discharge with regard to transport?"
"We would first like to highlight our satisfaction at the high utilisation rates that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has seen in commitment and payment appropriations for Trans-European Networks, both of which have reached almost 100%."
"We, of course, need the Member States to ensure that adequate funding is made available from national budgets, and I would like to point out again that Parliament has always supported a higher level of funding for these networks."
"We trust that the review of the network projects this year, in 2010, will be an opportunity to assess whether this expenditure has been sufficient and effective."
"In any case, monitoring certainly has been."
"We also welcome the fact that the annual accounts of the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency are legal and regular, although we are concerned at the delays in recruitment."
"The Commission's Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport has informed us, however, that this will be brought up to date."
"On the other hand, we are concerned at the low uptake of payment appropriations for transport safety, the even lower uptake for the Marco Polo programme, which enjoys Parliament's support, and also the exceptionally low uptake of appropriations for passenger rights."
"Given the size of the project, we are also concerned at the inadequate utilisation of payment appropriations in the Galileo programme and regret the total lack of data on tourism."
"We hope that this lack of data will be remedied in the new institutional framework."
"(FR) Mr President, I am in two minds about whether to take the floor."
"I am sorry for these points of order."
"I should like first to welcome the Council and to thank the Minister for joining us."
"I believe, Mr President, that it is customary to invite the Council to take the floor after the Commission has spoken."
"However, the Council did not take the floor before the political debate, even though it spoke at the end of the debate."
"It might perhaps be a good idea to offer it the floor in particular so that it can respond to the position of our rapporteur, who is proposing that the granting of discharge to the Council be postponed."
"We will reach an agreement with the Council on whether it thinks there is a need to speak."
"Discharge is a legal act, and I think that the Committee on Regional Development has no reason to argue against giving a discharge."
"At the same time, discharge is also a political evaluation. It clarifies whether we have reached the goals which we set for ourselves in 2008, and whether we have obtained sufficient value for the expenditures."
"There are quite a few misconceptions in circulation concerning the process of evaluating cohesion policy, including in this House."
"I would like most emphatically to draw your attention to the fact that not every error constitutes fraud."
"We often overestimate the criticisms made - otherwise quite rightly - by the Court of Auditors or in any other audit."
"I would like to point out that we do not have transparent measurement figures."
"We need a unified methodology to measure efficiency, effectiveness, and even absorption capacity, which plays a key role in determining how we should proceed with the cohesion policy."
"In 2008, only 32% of the expenditure came from this planning cycle, while the rest was taken from the spending of the pre-2006 cycle."
"It is difficult to judge, therefore, how successful we were in 2008 in meeting the targets of the new cycle."
"Certain Member States did not even reach 32%."
"Everyone bears part of the responsibility for the delays in using up the funds."
"The recommendations made by the Commission and Parliament in the interest of simplification, which we made since 2008 in response to the crisis, have all served the purpose of making improvements on our part."
"The ball is in the court of the Member States; that is where significant progress has to be made."
"I would like to call to mind that according to Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, promoting the equality of men and women is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, one which every EU action must respect and that should, therefore, also be capable of being monitored in the discharge procedure for the implementation of the EU budget."
"To this end, it is indispensable that the statistical data on the use of the budget be available in an appropriate breakdown."
"We note with regret that in spite of all our efforts, the data that would make it possible to track budgetary spending by gender is still not available."
"This applies first of all to those areas which are especially called upon to put an end to discrimination, for instance, by means of the European Social Fund."
"I would like to mention one topic in particular: the delay in setting up the European Institute for Gender Equality."
"This Institute was supposed to begin operations in 2008, but in fact, its official opening will only take place this June."
"Clearly, this raises various problems in the budget process as well."
"Given that the mid-term review of various multiannual programmes is to take place in 2010, I would like once again to ask the Commission to develop a monitoring and assessment system that would make it possible to implement the principle of equality in the various budget items, and to be able to track the effects of the use of the various budget items on the development of unjustified differences."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, from a development perspective, the importance of budgetary discharge is in assuring taxpayers across Europe that the money is being spent efficiently and effectively in the developing world, in terms of aid effectiveness, as well as matching our 0.7% target for ODA contributions."
"We need to use our current aid budget effectively, that is not just more aid, but better aid."
"We need to use EU money as a seed to grow local solutions."
"We need to look at opportunities to give people in the developing world ownership of their development, for example, and specifically to the promotion of land ownership for individuals, families and communities."
"Countless women die giving birth every year."
"AIDS, malaria and TB still claim some four million lives a year."
"We have close on a billion illiterate people in the developing world."
"That is why we set the target between Parliament, Commission and Council of spending 20% of the basic spending on education and health."
"I am interested in seeing whether we have met those targets."
"Whenever I visit the developing world, I am struck by the intelligent and willing young people I meet."
"These young people are every bit as capable as young people everywhere."
"They need opportunity and encouragement to be enterprising."
"Investing in education is the key to this."
"That is why Parliament, Commission and Council agreed to those targets."
"We must now ensure by the audit system that we are meeting those targets."
"I want to say to the House here in the couple of seconds available to me that, in my view, one of the ways of relieving people from the terrible poverty they face is by investing in bringing about land ownership in the developing world."
"I can give an example of where that worked. It is in my own country in the 18th and 19th centuries."
"If you look at why Ireland is divided, it is because the successful people were given small pieces of land."
"It is time to stop just thinking of people in terms of aid, but to start thinking in terms of people as having the enterprising ability to do things for themselves if they are given the support."
"Mr President, to begin with, I want to thank the Council, and I appreciate the fact that the Council is present, because the question is whether the Council really wants to take responsibility for spending taxpayers' money, and whether the Council wants to show some respect for Parliament and for cooperation."
"Therefore, it is important that the Council is present."
"In my speech, I will concentrate on Parliament's discharge, and I want to thank Mr Staes for his very high level of cooperation."
"I agree with him on the very sound basic idea that Parliament can only work well if decision making is sufficiently open and transparent."
"In this way, we can make sure there are no scandals."
"We know that, however small the amounts of money we are talking about, if malpractice starts to appear, our reputation will be damaged for a long time."
"It is extremely important to prevent this from happening."
"We are not talking about Parliament's money, but taxpayers' money."
"The system must therefore be watertight, so that we can, in the end, take responsibility for this."
"There were many good principles in Mr Staes's report, but my own group took the view that the report should be shorter and more concise, and because of this, we removed some material from the report."
"In addition, we believe that there should have been concrete items in the report dealing with the activity of MEPs and Parliament as a whole in actual legislative work."
"For example, we have added some items concerning real estate policy, in which there is still a lot of room for improvement."
"We need to obtain an accurate and clear explanation of why there are problems in this area."
"This is the reason for the long debate."
"We want to know why the visitors' centre is already a few years late according to the timetable."
"What could the problem be here?"
"We want answers to these questions."
"We should give congratulations here, regarding the fact that at last, Parliament has quickly got new regulations both for Members and for aides too."
"It is true that this has been a big improvement, but there is still a lot to change here."
"Let me give an example."
"According to the new regulation, I first have to fly from here in Strasbourg to Finland, and only from there can I fly to Brussels."
"Even if I had a visiting group in Brussels or a report to prepare tomorrow, this would not make any difference: I cannot go from here straight to Brussels."
"If I did so, I would not be paid travelling expenses or any other compensation."
"I do not understand why our lives need to be so inconvenient, when we know that the journey from here to my home town of Turku in Finland takes a day, and it takes another day to come back from there if I want to go to Brussels to do some work there."
"When I asked why this is the case, the administration answered that I could fly to Finland via Rome or Athens."
"I do not have an office in Rome or Athens, or any work to do there; these are in Brussels."
"If we have two workplaces, then it is reasonable for us to be able to work in both places."
"There are still areas where we need to get back on to the right track."
"We will return to these in next year's report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with a word of thanks."
"The outstanding and thorough work by Mr Staes and the Court of Auditors of the European Union have made it possible for us to prepare a careful accounting for the use of the 2008 budget as regards Parliament."
"I also owe thanks to my fellow Members whose proposed amendments contributed to refining the report."
"There was general agreement among us on the assessment of the facts; the differences that emerged mainly concerned the ways in which the identified errors could be corrected."
"Now, when we are voting on the discharge, we, elected MEPs, assume full legal responsibility for the 2008 budget."
"We certify to the citizens of Europe that Parliament used the monies spent for the purposes for which they were designated and in accordance with the rules."
"These days, when the crisis places great burdens on each citizen, we must be particularly careful in spending taxpayers' money."
"The standards we impose on ourselves must be higher than those we impose on others, as this is the key to our credibility and integrity."
"At the same time, we must also be clear that the oversight we exercise is not in itself sufficient to guarantee that funds have been spent intelligently and in compliance with the rules."
"That is possible only if we also put in place a reliable, solid, internal control system."
"We socialists consider this to be the most important."
"Therefore, I would like to focus on this point."
"We need to place great emphasis on the appropriate functioning of the internal control system of the institutions under supervision, because our conviction is that it is better to prevent problems than to have to find solutions for them later on."
"Institutional independence is an important guarantee of a properly functioning internal control system."
"This is the guarantee of objectivity and the way to ensure compliance with international accounting rules and best practices."
"The standards in themselves do not, however, guarantee an effective internal control system."
"There were improvements in 2009 in this regard."
"There is no internal control system - no matter how complex - that is free from error, since it is the work of human beings, and that is why we give a discharge every year"
"It is important to stress, in my view, that we supported all those proposed amendments that were concrete, attainable and realistic, but we rejected every generalisation that does not improve but rather obscures our standpoint."
"We rejected all proposals that would reduce the political groups' independence."
"We are convinced that the independence of the European Parliament's groups is inseparable from their financial responsibility."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats performs its work in full awareness of this responsibility."
"If the other political groups wish to improve their own activities, let them do so."
"Offering these thoughts, I would ask that you accept this report and give a discharge on behalf of the European Parliament"
"Mr President, I am a great fan of the British rock band Genesis."
"They have a fantastic track called 'Dance on a Volcano', and this track came to mind this week, which has been rather dominated by volcanic ash."
"Not that the song made me want to go dancing in Iceland; instead, it came to mind in connection with this morning's debate on the substantiation of expenditure in 2008, another year for which the European Court of Auditors was unable to give its approval."
"It is there that I see the parallel with dancing on a volcano; a volcano filled not with lava or ash but with distrust."
"Europe is subject to intense pressure of all kinds, such as pressure on the euro and the pressure of the conflict between EU and national perspectives."
"This is already enough to bring this metaphorical volcano to a head, so we can do without poor financial accountability and public distrust causing the volcano to erupt."
"How can this be prevented?"
"To my mind, there is only one way, and that is through transparency; optimum transparency in all the institutions."
"Transparency within the Council - and thus the Member States - precisely because this is the main source of the irregularities detected each year."
"Incidentally, I am pleased that the Council is still here."
"I would also call on the Member States to establish transparency in their expenditure of European funds at long last by giving a public account of this expenditure on an annual basis."
"I am at a loss to understand why they persist in obstructing this."
"I am convinced that, if the Member States were to handle their own money the same way, their citizens would consider this unacceptable."
"Fair is fair, however, and greater transparency is also needed in our own Parliament."
"Mr Staes has rightly drawn up a very critical report and, after the many improvements seen in recent years, it is now time to throw open the windows once and for all and show the European public by means of this transparency that we are able to handle their money responsibly, as that is what this is all about."
"My final point concerns mutual relations between the Council and Parliament."
"Some 40 years ago, a gentlemen's agreement was deemed necessary to enable the two parties to work in relative peace and quiet rather than fighting in the gutter."
"The agreement proved very useful back then, but it would be fair to say that it no longer works, as we are now fighting in the gutter."
"As I see it, however, a more important point is that the Council and Parliament are now strong, mature institutions and, as such, should be able to monitor each other in a mature way even without a gentlemen's agreement."
"I should like to ask the Council, now it is here, whether it can give its response to this, and whether it agrees that it is possible for the two institutions to monitor each other effectively without a gentlemen's agreement."
"With mutual openness instead of a gentlemen's agreement, the Council and Parliament can dance together in harmony without fear of the ground giving way beneath their feet or of further public distrust leading to an eruption."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I am now speaking on behalf of my group and not as rapporteur for Parliament's discharge."
"I shall have another opportunity to do that later."
"I should like to raise a few issues."
"The first concerns the Commission's discharge."
"This is a question to both the Commissioner and the Council, and relates to the fact that 80% of our funds are actually spent in the Member States, and that Parliament has been advocating national management declarations for many years."
"Rapporteur Mr Liberadzki sets forth the new options very clearly in a number of paragraphs."
"We have a new treaty, and the new wording of Article 317(2) of this treaty enables the Commission to produce proposals for introducing mandatory national management declarations as soon as possible."
"Commissioner Å emeta, I would ask you to address this in your reply."
"Are you prepared to take up this option?"
"Four Member States are already doing this, which is to be welcomed, but they are doing it in four different ways, so let us coordinate these efforts somewhat."
"The Council will say: fair enough, but there are practical objections."
"Some Member States are federal states with mutual entities, such as Belgium with Wallonia, Brussels and Flanders, so how is the Belgian federal minister supposed to come up with a national management declaration?"
"Yet this is no problem, ladies and gentlemen."
"This national minister simply needs to come to an agreement with his regional ministers, await their regional policy statements and management declarations and then present them all to this House and to the public."
"Then he will be able to say, for example, Wallonia and Brussels are doing well and Flanders is not, or the other way round, and so on."
"The second aspect concerns Mr Liberadzki's resolution, which discusses the Court of Auditors' special report on the European Commission's management of pre-accession assistance to Turkey."
"In my opinion, the wording used is not very good; in certain respects and in certain paragraphs, it has been somewhat misused to interfere in the accession negotiations."
"Together with Mr Geier, I have tabled a number of deleting amendments."
"I have also presented a proposal to improve the text, and I would ask my fellow Members to consider this."
"Finally, addressing the Council, I should like to say that I hope you are paying attention, President-in-Office."
"Are you prepared to say in your reply a little later on whether or not you will comply with the request made by the rapporteur, the Committee on Budgetary Control and this House to reply before 1 June 2010 and produce the documents requested in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the resolution?"
"Are you prepared to give an answer already as to whether or not you will comply with this?"
"This is of the utmost importance to us in determining whether or not relations between the Council and Parliament are as they should be."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I speak on behalf of the British Conservative Party, who will again this year vote against discharge of the budget."
"This is a position that we have consistently taken, and we will continue to do so until we see greater urgency applied to the achievement of a positive statement of assurance by the Court of Auditors."
"I do, however, wish to publicly acknowledge the progress that has been made in improving the financial management standards by this past Commission."
"The Court of Auditors particularly notes progress which has been made in the fields of agriculture, research, energy, transport and education."
"I commend the Commission for the improvements they have made."
"This is most encouraging."
"However, a great deal needs to be done."
"The Court of Auditors has yet again adversely commented on the weaknesses of controls, on numerous irregularities and the slow rate of recovery of monies due to the European Union."
"It is also clear that, while responsibility ultimately rests with the European Commission, it is the Member States and the Council - in particular the Council - who need to be far more conscientious in their application of European funding and who need to demonstrate far greater urgency in their efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance."
"We operate under the Lisbon Treaty and, as Members of the European Parliament, we owe it to European taxpayers that we can assure the public that the budget delivers value for money, and assure the public likewise that there is integrity in the accounting procedures of the European Union."
"Until the Court of Auditors feels able to give that positive statement of assurance, I and my party will continue to vote against discharge of the budget."
"Mr President, this debate is about us, as EU parliamentarians, taking responsibility not only collectively, but also individually, for how the EU's funds were used in 2008."
"When the debate is over and the votes have been cast in May, it is us that our citizens will hold accountable."
"Let me state one thing straightaway: our group is critical of the way in which the EU administered our taxpayers' money in 2008."
"Of course, there are a lot of good things that need no further comment."
"In some areas, there has even been some progress compared with 2007."
"However, there are still too many areas for which we must say that things are not acceptable."
"One example is the Commission's accounts."
"Where the structural funds are concerned, the Court of Auditors concludes that at least - I repeat, at least - 11% of disbursements from the funds were contrary to the rules."
"Part of this is due to errors and omissions; part to fraud and misappropriation."
"That does not change the fact that billions of euro in this area alone should not have been paid out."
"Is this acceptable?"
"We know all the excuses."
"The Commission says it is the fault of the Member States, because they are responsible for control."
"The Member States say the Commission is to blame, because the rules are far too complex."
"The blame is passed from pillar to post."
"The question we must ask ourselves is as follows: would we approve the accounts of a sports club, a trade union or a political party where 11% of the expenditure in a central area had been paid out in contravention of the rules?"
"I agree with those who say that fundamental structural changes are needed to change this situation."
"We must therefore use the discharge to push through such changes."
"Such pressure must also be exerted on the Council."
"In April last year, Parliament refused to discharge the Council's accounts for 2007 by a large majority."
"We said that we could not accept responsibility for the accounts before the electorate until the Council agreed to meet formally with the relevant committees in Parliament and to answer our questions publicly."
"Nonetheless, to demonstrate our goodwill, we voted in November to grant discharge to the Council's accounts - on the clear condition that changes would be made this year."
"Today, we have to state that these changes have not taken place."
"Let me give a specific example. Year after year, the Council transfers millions of euro from the translation account to the travel account."
"In other words, in addition to the funds already in the travel account."
"We must therefore ask the Council the obvious questions. Why are you doing this?"
"What is all this travel money spent on? Which countries are benefiting from it?"
"The Council is happy to answer informally, off the record."
"Up until today, however - though this may change - the Council has refused to answer openly and publicly."
"That is simply not good enough."
"We are therefore of the opinion that any discharge must await an interinstitutional agreement that clearly sets out the Council's obligations in respect of transparency and cooperation with Parliament."
"Our criticism of the Council and the Commission is clear."
"It is shared by many of our fellow Members in other political groups."
"Precisely because our criticism is so clear, however, we also have a duty to be critical of ourselves as regards our own - Parliament's - financial administration."
"I therefore find it regrettable that the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control ended up being less critical than it had been in the Chair's original version."
"We therefore also support the re-insertion of the critical passages."
"I hope that at the vote in May, there will be broad support for the fact that our willingness to take a critical view of ourselves is precisely what gives our criticism and demands of the Council and Commission added strength and authority."
"Finally, I would simply like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, who this year have once again worked towards greater transparency and responsibility in the way the EU looks after its citizens' money."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the discharge is one of the most important acts that we are responsible for."
"We are effectively being called to approve the way in which the European taxpayer's money has been spent and we have to base our decision on the report by the European Court of Auditors."
"The auditors' report for 2008 only clears 10% of the budget."
"The rest is affected by different levels of errors."
"Would any board of directors approve the management of a company in such a state of affairs?"
"Of course not."
"The situation has been the same for the last 15 years, and this Parliament has always granted discharge, on the basis of the improvement in the use of European Union funds."
"I am sorry to say that what the taxpayers want to know is if their money has gone to the right person for the right purpose and for the right amount."
"We should be making the decision on discharge in view of this."
"Over the years, the only progress achieved by the Commission, Parliament and the Council is the shifting of responsibility to Member States."
"While it is true that programmes are implemented in Member States, the institution to which the European taxpayers entrust their money is the European Commission."
"This is the institution that releases the money and that should, therefore, be performing the necessary controls before doing so."
"To make matters worse, the Commission and Parliament are now discussing a tolerable risk of error."
"Why tolerate any error - the new name for irregularity - when the financial complexity of the European Union is that of a medium-sized bank?"
"Last year, the Council discharge was postponed from April to November because this Parliament said it was not satisfied with their financial management, even if the auditors did not criticise their financial management."
"When the situation had not changed by November, this Parliament took the decision to discharge the Council."
"Now again, all cannons are directed to the Council and postponement is being proposed."
"Are we being serious about our responsibility or are we playing politics here?"
"Is discharge an interinstitutional game, as has been said in the past?"
"Can taxpayers tolerate this game anymore?"
"This is about their money."
"Colleagues, I call upon all of you to exercise your responsibility with due care and withhold discharge to the Commission, to Parliament, to the Council, to the European Development Fund and to the Court of Auditors, that does not publish the declaration of financial interests, until all of these institutions give proof of sound financial management."
"Mr President, there is a problem, because on the notice board, I see the name of Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, who is going to speak on behalf of the Council, but he is going to respond to what I said about the Council's budget and their failure to implement the budget and other documents - words which he did not hear, because he arrived very late."
"Mr Czarnecki, I ask you to take the floor on a point of order."
"rapporteur. - (PL) I wanted to say, very briefly, that I would like to give the minister a chance to respond to my criticisms, and that I would like to have a minute to repeat them."
"You were right when you said that Mr LÃ³pez Garrido is on the list of speakers."
"We shall see."
"He has just the same freedom to speak as you do."
"(DE) Mr President, I believe that all members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are agreed on one point, to be precise, the fact that we need solutions for the EU agency system."
"For that reason, I would like to propose eleven approaches to a solution."
"They could enable us to save EUR 500 million every year, without affecting the quality of administrative performance."
"My eleven approaches to a solution are as follows: 1) There needs to be a sufficient primary legislative base."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has also failed to create this base."
"2) An immediate freeze, until an independent analysis has established the added value of this decentralisation once and for all."
"3) The closing of seven agencies and the merging of the administrative tasks of individual agencies."
"4) In future, every agency must be the direct responsibility of a single EU Commissioner and, above all, the EU Commissioner for interinstitutional relations and administration should be responsible for horizontal issues."
"5) A reduction in the members of the administrative board."
"The number of full members should not exceed 10% of the positions or a total number of 20."
"6) There needs to be a catalogue of location criteria that must be taken into account when determining the location of agencies - as we have already heard in Mrs Haug's speech, this is urgently needed."
"7) EU agencies should be freed from EU Staff Regulations."
"8) All agency directors should be elected for a fixed period of time at the proposal of the Commission and only after consulting and after receiving the approval of the European Parliament."
"9) A clear performance agreement between the Commission and the agencies with clearly defined quantitative criteria that are summarised by the EU Court of Auditors in an annual performance ranking."
"10) All agencies should transfer financial data to a database."
"Then it would be quite straightforward for us as budget rapporteurs to do statistical analysis."
"Until now that has been impossible, as data comes in paper form."
"11) The principle of subsidiarity."
"The requirement for justification has yet to be taken into account by the Commission."
"So, the solutions are on the table."
"Mr Geier, Mrs GrÃ¤Ãle, it is time that you also allowed this solution here in the House."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be here at this debate, even though I was not formally invited."
"I was not formally invited by Parliament to attend this debate."
"Despite that, when I learnt that this House and some of its Members were asking for my presence here, it was my great pleasure to come straight away to attend this debate."
"I believe that the Council budget for the 2008 financial year was correctly implemented, as can be deduced from the annual report of the Court of Auditors."
"There have been one or two speeches - Mr SÃ¸ndergaard's, for example - that have mentioned transparency, lack of transparency or not enough transparency."
"I want to be perfectly clear on this: the Council believes that it is absolutely transparent in the way in which it implements its budget and therefore that it correctly applies the requirements that have been made, as demanded by the Financial Regulation."
"In addition, as you know, the Council publishes a report on the previous year's financial management on its website."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Council is today the only institution to have published a preliminary report on its 2009 accounts for the general public to see."
"Similarly, a few days ago, on 15 March to be precise, the Chair of Coreper and the Secretary-General of the Council met with a delegation from Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control."
"At that meeting, they gave all the information requested on the topics and issues put forward by Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control relating to implementation of the Council's budget for 2008."
"Mr Gerbrandy asked about the need to move forward with mutual control by both institutions on budgetary issues without a 'gentlemen's agreement'."
"That is what Mr Gerbrandy said."
"If Parliament wished to review that agreement, the Council would be willing to consider it and discuss a new agreement based on reciprocity between the two institutions."
"There is therefore no problem in discussing that situation and perhaps reaching a new agreement that, if possible, improves on the one we have had until now."
"That is what the Council would like to point out with regard to the debate held this morning."
"I am very grateful to you for the oral invitation to come here but, I repeat, I was not formally invited to this sitting."
"Thank you Minister."
"Thank you very much for so kindly complying with our request."
"That gives me cause to say that the Commission never receives a formal invitation to this sitting either."
"I have been a Member of this House for a while and I have noticed that in cases like yours, when the Council is represented here - even when it is not really necessary - it contributes greatly to the success of a Presidency."
"In this respect, I should like to thank you again very much."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Å emeta, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, thank you once again for joining us."
"My first words will be to thank my fellow Member, Mr Liberadzki, since I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) concerning the granting of discharge to the European Commission."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteurs for the other political groups, as well as the Court of Auditors and, in particular, its President, Mr Caldeira, who is doing a tremendous job of clarifying these extremely complicated procedures for us."
"Our group is going to vote in favour of granting discharge to the European Commission, Mr Å emeta, and I would like to mention the part played by your predecessor, Mr Kallas - who did a great deal of work with us, particularly under the previous term of office - in achieving these positive developments."
"Firstly, on the annual accounts, the Court of Auditors has issued a positive Statement of Assurance."
"Therefore, Mr Ashworth, perhaps the Conservatives will vote in favour of the annual accounts at least."
"May I take this opportunity to thank Mr Taverne and his predecessor, Mr Gray."
"On the subject of the accounts, I cannot help but voice concern, once again, in the face of the EUR 50 billion of negative own capital, and I still do not understand why we do not enter into the accounts the claims we have on the Member States, which add up to approximately EUR 40 billion and represent the pensions payable to staff."
"As for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, some people are saying that the Court of Auditors' statement is negative."
"The fact is, we do not have a clue."
"I have read and reread that statement."
"We do not know whether or not, under Article 287 of the treaty, we have a positive opinion on the underlying transactions."
"The Court has issued some opinions - five paragraphs - to us, but we do not know."
"Moreover, the resolution proposes that the Court fulfil this task stipulated by the treaty."
"It is in this context that we must come together to review all these discharge procedures on the cost of control."
"As regards the methods, we are asking our governments for national statements of assurance that we will never have."
"I propose that national audit bodies be involved in the audit chain so that they may issue certificates to their governments, which would be included in the discharge procedure."
"I also propose shortening the deadlines."
"Can you believe that this is April 2010 and we are talking about the 2008 accounts?"
"The deadlines have to be shortened."
"I propose a study on the consolidated accounts."
"I do not agree with postponing discharge in respect of the Council because the Court of Auditors has not made any comments regarding the Council."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by proposing an interinstitutional conference with the Commission, the Council, all the national parliaments, which control the executives, and the national audit bodies, in order to develop our discharge procedure in very technical areas and to make matters much clearer than they are today."
"(DE) Mr President, representatives of the Commission and, above all, the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we hear this every year in the debate on improvements in the implementation of the distribution of European funds: more accurate and more efficient control of expenditure in all bodies and institutions, more transparency for Parliament and also for citizens."
"The presence today of the Council is the first indication that something is changing in the Council as well."
"Marvellous, we are pleased - as you have heard - but that is certainly not enough for us."
"It is precisely the difference that you mentioned - you believe you have created complete transparency, while we believe you have not yet answered our questions from the debate at the end of November - that shows that we are not yet cooperating with each other as well as we should be."
"You spoke of the 1970 agreement that you want to amend and develop."
"That is all well and good, but this expectation of ours is hardly new."
"We have mentioned it a few times and now you have acted as if it were a new thing entirely."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats will support Mr Czarnecki's report."
"We share his criticism and that of the other groups."
"We will not grant discharge to the Council, either today or next month."
"I am therefore surprised by the request by Mrs Andreasen, since I obviously believe that the Member States are responsible for 80% of the funds."
"That does not exempt the Council from its responsibilities, since the Council is not a fourth or fifth institution in the EU, but works together with the Member States."
"However, our criticism, I agree, has no real consequences."
"As Mr Audy has pointed out, we must develop our tools."
"Every year, we show the Council the yellow card of discharge refusal and nothing happens."
"We must therefore develop our tools: not only tangible criticism, but also consequences - what happens if the Council does not work with us."
"That will possibly also mean constitutional change."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Weiler."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have just checked again in the rules of procedure: we are not supposed to sing songs in plenary, without first asking the Conference of Presidents."
"However, we are allowed to congratulate a colleague."
"Mr Chatzimarkakis, whose birthday it is today, has the floor for two and a half minutes."
"Many happy returns!"
"(DE) Thank you, Mr President, that was very kind."
"Commissioner Å emeta, the adoption of the reports on the budgetary management of the European bodies and institutions is one of our most important obligations as representatives of the European people - it is our sovereign duty."
"The question of what Europe has done with taxpayers' hard earned money is crucial for the acceptance of the European integration project."
"I would first like to thank all the rapporteurs for their efforts."
"However, I see light and shadow in the reports."
"I see light in budgetary management overall."
"Meanwhile, it is the case that everywhere the EU controls and manages funds itself, it runs things in accordance with the rules."
"Whether or not it is efficient is another matter altogether."
"As the European Parliament, we should pay closer attention to the efficiency of policies, political issues and implementation, in particular, with regard to the 2020 agenda."
"There is shadow in the area of cohesion policy."
"Eleven per cent of things do not comply with the rules and this percentage is too high."
"Therefore, it is very important that the EU tries harder to recover funds paid out incorrectly."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore adopted an amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"We want 100% of the money back."
"For 2010, I have the honour of being the rapporteur for the European Commission discharge."
"Due to the delayed entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, this will be no easy task."
"We must monitor very closely whether the new responsibilities of individual Commissioners lead to even less transparency and more concealment of responsibilities."
"We must and will examine this very closely."
"Allow me to single out two areas: firstly, the so-called non-governmental organisations and secondly, the gentlemen's agreement."
"Between 2008 and 2009, the European Union paid NGOs over EUR 300 million in funds."
"These include honourable organisations like the Deutsche Welthungerhilfe."
"However, there are also some that want to destroy the reputation of the European Union, namely Counter Balance, which has attacked the European Investment Bank."
"This is not acceptable and we must deal with it."
"We need a register and a definition of such non-governmental organisations, as they receive a lot of tax money."
"With regard to the gentlemen's agreement I would like to thank Mr LÃ³pez Garrido."
"I would like to thank you for coming."
"I would also like to point to the historical element: questioning and revising the gentlemen's agreement after 40 years is a huge step."
"Given the importance of Parliament due to the new Treaty of Lisbon, it is also a necessary step."
"We must ensure transparency, here and in the Council."
"Mr President, yet again, this Parliament is being presented with substandard accounts and being asked to discharge them."
"These are accounts which the Court of Auditors has refused to give a positive statement of assurance - accounts which still fall short of being legal and regular."
"The auditors have said - again - that these accounts are riddled with irregularities, yet we are expected to rubber-stamp them."
"I am pleased that Mrs Mathieu has recommended a postponement of discharge for the European Police College accounts."
"We will support that recommendation, as OLAF needs more time to conclude its investigation."
"Allegations have been made of fraudulent activity at that College, including the use of taxpayers' money by staff to buy furniture for their personal use."
"I can tell Parliament that the British Conservatives will not accept these irregularities."
"We shall refuse to grant discharge until such time as the Court of Auditors gives a positive statement of assurance."
"Trust in politicians is at an all-time low, and we will reduce our standing further if we are seen to condone such waste."
"Every time we discharge substandard accounts, we encourage more waste and more fraud."
"Every time we vote to grant discharge, we send a signal to the Council, to the Commission and to our constituents that we do not treat this issue seriously."
"My party will look particularly carefully at how Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs decide to vote on this issue."
"They cannot argue at home that they want to bring change to politics - to clean up and reform politics - and yet, year on year, vote to accept these substandard accounts."
"Anyone who is serious about reforming this system and about protecting the taxpayer should vote against granting discharge."
"(NL) Mr President, given the high error rates, I do not approve of granting discharge to the European Commission."
"We are still not doing enough to simplify the rules, particularly those for the Structural Funds."
"Four independent advisory boards have presented a proposal, to which the Commission has yet to give a satisfactory response."
"Independent, external verification within the Commission's Impact Assessment Board is truly indispensable."
"If Dr Stoiber's high-level group lends substance to this, that group should also be given sufficient resources for the necessary secretarial support."
"In addition, a broader mandate is required."
"We need to reduce not only the administrative burdens but also the costs of substantive compliance, nor should the mandate remain confined to the existing legislation: new legislation, too, ought to be subjected to critical analysis."
"This, Mr President, would represent a contribution to a structural reduction in the burden of rules unduly hindering the functioning of authorities and enterprises."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to discuss the problems with development aid that are nearly always emphasised by the Court of Auditors and to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her good cooperation that was remarkably pleasant."
"Firstly, there is often the problem of budget support."
"That means that there is even suspicion that in countries where we are trying to help the population a little, budget support is partly being used by corrupt and totalitarian regimes to suppress undesirable population groups or even critics."
"I am extremely critical of this budget support."
"It should be reduced or stopped for countries in which we clearly have problems with the use of budget support."
"Secondly, now as before, we have the problem that the payments often contain errors, that there is a lack of coordination and targeting of development aid projects between the different institutions and levels in one country and there is no recognisable setting of priorities."
"It is essential that this is made a matter of priority, so that we can improve the sustainability and effectiveness of projects in those countries where people really are in dire need."
"Furthermore, now as before, I consider it essential that development aid and the European Development Fund in general are integrated into the overall budget."
"On pre-accession aid for Turkey I would like to say that I was surprised that the completely normal criticism which, in other countries, would have long since led to the blocking and withholding of financing, has led so quickly to a hiccup in the cooperation between Turkey and the Commission."
"I consider it completely normal that we firstly lay down the strategy and the goals, then the timeframes, the project orientation, the yardsticks for measuring and then the method of performance monitoring."
"However, if all of this is lacking and projects are implemented that are then declared successful, I have a problem with the way the programme is implemented."
"For this reason, I personally consider it necessary that at least part of the funding is withheld until it we have suitable assurances that the funds will be properly spent."
"We have now reached a compromise, but I consider it necessary to monitor the problem, since other countries like Bulgaria, Romania or Greece will be affected."
"I think it is necessary that everyone be treated in the same way and not differently."
"Therefore, I ask that in the area of buildings policy, provision be made for a medium-term building strategy by means of clear construction and financial planning."
"Large projects should receive their own budget lines and a reporting system related to construction progress, and we should not pay any more costs for bridging lenders."
"As we are such large institutions, we need buildings and they must be planned carefully and transparently."
"My last point is that I believe it is necessary to simplify the programmes as a matter of urgency, since that is how problems in the respective countries arise, and this must not simply remain a rhetorical demand, but must finally be implemented."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, I am delighted that you are here and so demonstrate the Council's recognition of this important debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we all know this little trick: if you want to embarrass someone, ask them a question with a wording like, do you still actually smack your children?"
"Even if the person says no, they have implicitly admitted that in the past, they did smack their children."
"The discharge report for Parliament by Mr Staes, who I would like to thank for his work, is a critical report, and to me, in some areas at least, it has followed this logic."
"Self-criticism is good, but it should then be accurate."
"I have had many discussions in my group on how we might reject this or that wording in the report on Parliament's discharge."
"Some of us have come under more than a little pressure in our home countries regarding this."
"However, I do want to convey to you my answers to these questions as to why we have rejected some wording or other in the report on Parliament's discharge."
"There are proposals that are already a reality."
"We could re-table them, but why?"
"There are proposals that are not helpful, such as the idea of making the Committee on Budgetary Control a sort of alternative internal audit authority or an intermediary between the Bureau and plenary."
"There are many good proposals in this report that were, however, all adopted."
"Then there are proposals in this report that only represent a partial reality, as, for example, in Amendment 26 now on the table."
"This amendment demands the establishing of an internal control system in groups of this House."
"Nothing should be more obvious."
"In the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, however, this has long been a reality, precisely for that reason."
"If my group were to agree to this, we would be acting as if we had some catching up to do."
"Therefore, we can, in this example, only agree if this reality is also illustrated in the report."
"I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph: as it is the fact in the S&D Group."
"(SV) Mr President, although many problems remain, control and auditing of the EU's funds has improved and is becoming increasingly thorough."
"We are seeing the results of this, which is pleasing - but more can be done."
"Our motto should be not to waste a single cent."
"Where the development funds are concerned, the EU is the world's largest giver of aid."
"It is good that we are making a difference in the world and demonstrating our solidarity with the poorest people in the world."
"I believe EU citizens are happy to go along with this, but the money must be used in the best possible way."
"It must not go to corrupt leaders who are lining their own pockets, nor must we waste money on projects and initiatives that are not forward-looking and of adequate quality."
"We here in Parliament have a particular responsibility in this respect."
"I submitted a number of amendments to the Committee, which were dealt with relatively benevolently by the rapporteur."
"The fact is that the EU must be clearer and must demand that those countries that the EU supports uphold the most basic human rights, such as freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
"Unfortunately, that is not currently the case."
"Allow me to give a very clear example: EU aid to Eritrea."
"In Eritrea, critics of the regime are thrown into prison without trial and without even being told of what they are accused."
"They have languished in appalling prison conditions for years."
"What have they done?"
"They have criticised the country's leadership and president."
"We should be clearer about this."
"The EU must be able to make its aid conditional upon the recipient countries respecting the most fundamental human rights and I believe that the report should have been more forceful and clearer in this respect."
"I believe this is what the taxpayers of Europe would expect of us."
"(NL) Mr President, the Staes report contains a very important paragraph entitled 'Members as public persons'."
"This title is very apt."
"Each Member of this Parliament is a public person, and must be able to answer to the public at any moment for how he or she works and, in particular, must be able to justify how he or she has spent the budgets provided by the taxpayer."
"Indeed, all of us here handle taxpayers' money, and so citizens have a right to know how we are spending that money."
"There has been a great deal of improvement in terms of accountability in Parliament in recent years, but MEPs are not yet required to be accountable for all their funds."
"I refer in particular to the maximum of EUR 4 200 per month at the disposal of each Member for general expenditure."
"I now have to pay a substantial sum each year to employ an external accountant to provide that accountability."
"This is odd; we should simply be providing it in the presence of Parliament's services as we do for our travel and subsistence expenses."
"Therefore, I would urge you to support Amendment 33 to paragraph 65 on this subject."
"(PL) The European Personnel Selection Office, or EPSO, is an interinstitutional unit responsible for selection of staff for the European Union institutions."
"I am very pleased that the discharge reports have taken up this topic."
"Efforts are necessary to investigate and eliminate the geographical disproportions among candidates and among successful candidates for positions in the civil service of the European Union institutions."
"Particularly unacceptable is the continued under representation of citizens of the new Member States, including Poland, and not only in the European Union's civil service."
"This phenomenon is especially flagrant, in my opinion, among middle and higher level managerial staff."
"Doubts are also caused by the long recruitment process and the management of lists of successful candidates."
"Often, successful candidates who have been chosen in competitions - those who were successful in a competition - accept a job outside the European Union institutions because they simply cannot wait so long, and the entire recruitment process is wasted."
"I am pleased that the EPSO has set up a corrective programme and accepted the Court of Auditors' comments, and that it has already accepted some of the European Parliament's comments."
"I will certainly follow the effects of the corrective programme carefully, always remembering that the EPSO's objective should be, above all, to reach the best possible candidates with the offers of EU institutions, to select the best possible candidates and to create the best possible list of successful candidates, with proportional representation of all the Member States."
"(BG) Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my view on the discharge of responsibility by European agencies."
"Allow me, first of all, to pass on the apologies of my colleague, Georgios Stavrakakis, who was unable to come to the debate on this matter, even though he worked on the report during the last few months as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament."
"He cannot come due to the well-publicised transport problems."
"In the view of the S&D Group, issues relating to the transparent and legal use of the European Union's budget are a priority and the management of public finances as a whole depends, to a large extent, on the successful resolution of these issues."
"For this reason, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Mathieu, as well as the members of the European Court of Auditors and the heads of the agencies with whom we worked very extensively."
"I wish to point out that the auditing of budget agencies is an extremely complicated and arduous procedure as there is significant variation among them in terms of their practices and competence."
"Allow me to begin with the general statement that 2008 proves that the agencies are continuing to improve the implementation of their budgets from one year to the next."
"I would like to digress and say to any fellow Members not expecting any comments from the Court of Auditors in support of the budget that the time when the Court of Auditors stops making comments will be when confidence in this body will decrease."
"The fact is that the number of errors is on the decline and the level of transparency and discipline is on the rise with the implementation of budgets."
"This progress is also taken into consideration by the European Court of Auditors, while agency heads are making ever-greater efforts to improve accounting and control systems."
"There are obviously still shortcomings. These were mentioned by Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"The causes of these shortcomings are both objective and subjective."
"The good news is that they can all be remedied and action is being taken to do this."
"The main problem arose with the European Police College CEPOL."
"The problems in this organisation have been going on for several years and are due to various reasons: the change to the accounting system, unclarified matters relating to the host state, omissions regarding the notification of contracts and the use of public funds for purposes other than those intended."
"Even though concessions have been made for a few years, producing a result somewhat more slowly than expected, I support this year the postponement of discharge in respect of the implementation of this agency's 2008 budget until a new audit has been carried out and the College's new management assumes clear responsibility for ensuring that the irregularities and legal inconsistencies are eliminated in the shortest time possible."
"The second problem was linked to Frontex, especially to the agency's ability to use the resources allocated to it."
"The head of the agency gave satisfactory answers on this matter during the Committee hearings."
"There are a number of actions we need to take in future in the area of budget control within the agencies."
"I will boil them down to three measures."
"Firstly, agency heads must continue their efforts to observe stricter compliance with budget discipline."
"Secondly, measures must be taken to simplify accounting rules, especially in the case of cofinanced and self-financed agencies."
"Lastly, we must examine a proposal tabled by the Court of Auditors for the introduction of criteria indicating how successfully these agencies perform their tasks."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few comments about the use of European funds in the enlargement process."
"Here we had to evaluate a special report by the Court of Auditors on the use of pre-accession aid for Turkey."
"As the Committee on Budgetary Control, we are very disappointed by the findings of the report by the Court of Auditors."
"In the previous period, funds were spent by the Commission without any strategy or effective audit and, above all, projects had no concrete relation to progress towards accession."
"Even with the new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), which entered into force in 2007, the Court is not in a position to assess the effectiveness of the funds spent."
"Yet here we are talking about EUR 4.8 million up to 2013."
"At first, a sense of helplessness predominated in the committee."
"Where and when can we have any political influence on the use of pre-accession aid if the next assessment of the Court only takes place after 2012?"
"The Committee on Budgetary Control therefore calls on the Commission to revise the IPA programme as a matter of urgency."
"Until progress is assessed, we also call for the freezing of funds to the annual level of 2006."
"Here, we have the beginnings of a compromise."
"In addition, we suggest that generally - generally and without explicit reference to Turkey - the IPA must be applied flexibly, including for special forms of membership or cooperation or neighbourhoods or similar options."
"In the process of accession negotiations, focussing purely on EU Membership may prove to be a very poor investment."
"Now the criticism of the Greens and the left is that with these demands, we would interfere in foreign policy and Turkey would thus receive special treatment."
"No, if we do not react to obvious deficits here, then we are ensuring special treatment."
"If we make exceptions with Turkey, we can also cease work with budgetary control for Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria or Greece."
"That is, after all, one and the same topic."
"I call on the Commission not to turn a blind eye, just because it is Turkey. Rather support Turkey's accession according to the accession criteria that the Community itself has set."
"(DA) Mr President, I would like to talk today about Parliament's discharge report."
"We have in front of us what I believe is the most thorough, most critical and most forward-looking European Parliament discharge report ever."
"That is a good thing."
"I would therefore like to thank Mr Staes for such a constructive piece of work."
"It is unusual for an institution to grant discharge to itself, and indeed this calls for a high degree of responsibility, transparency and control."
"However, the report actually helps ensure that we, as Parliament, are able to shoulder this responsibility and demonstrate transparency and ensure better control."
"That is, of course, a good thing."
"Having said that, there is still room for improvement."
"I will merely mention here some of the areas that I think some of the amendments address."
"I think we need to do more to allow our citizens to follow our work."
"We can ensure this by giving citizens easier access to our reports on the website - including those reports that are critical."
"I also think it is important for us to look at the functioning of our procurement procedures here in Parliament."
"This is a high risk area and good amendments have also been proposed in this respect."
"Moreover, I also think we need to look at whether the leadership structure can be improved and made even more transparent, both for us parliamentarians and for our citizens to help keep checks on Parliament."
"Furthermore, though it has often been said before, I do not, of course, think we should spend money on renovating our office facilities here in Strasbourg."
"Instead, we should ensure that we have only one seat."
"I come from Denmark, a country with a long tradition of transparency, openness and control, particularly as regards the use of taxpayers' money."
"These are values that I prize, and I believe that they should also be more prevalent throughout the EU."
"I believe that the discharge report for the European Parliament shows that we in Parliament are taking this on board and are moving in the right direction."
"It also puts us in a better position to criticise the other institutions."
"(NL) Mr President, a great deal has already been said in this debate, and so I should like to confine myself to two points."
"The first is Parliament's discharge; after all, if you want to monitor others, you have to take a particularly critical approach to your own budget."
"Mr Staes has presented a report on this that I would have endorsed wholeheartedly six or seven years ago, but in those six or seven years, many things have taken a turn for the better."
"Examples include the reimbursement of only those travel expenses actually incurred and the Statute for Assistants."
"The funny thing is that Mr Staes mentioned these in his speech a little while ago, but the pity of it is that these achievements do not yet appear in the report."
"I hope this can be rectified in the vote in two weeks' time so that the report is ultimately a balanced one."
"I have every confidence in this happening."
"The second is a general point, Mr President, as I think we shall be seeing a difficult budgetary discussion in coming years."
"Despite the extra tasks that have fallen to us since Lisbon, our budget is not expected to increase in the new period, which means that, in the context of European expenditure, it will become increasingly necessary to achieve several policy objectives at the same time with a single expense."
"This requires a Court of Auditors that can actually audit the multiple action of expenditure rather than merely looking at whether the rules are satisfied."
"Our Court of Auditors is currently unable to do this."
"Thus, if we wish to draw up an efficient budget for the new budgetary period that can also be audited, changes to the Court of Auditors will be required."
"Therefore, I propose that, in future, the Court of Auditors does indeed attend debates on budgets and on budgetary control, and I should like the European Commission to tell me how it means to approach this challenge."
"Mr President, I wanted to speak on the European Parliament's discharge and first of all to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done, and the hard work he has done, along with many others."
"I think it goes without saying that everyone in this Chamber wants improvements to openness and transparency and wants value for money for taxpayers, but we have to make sure that any changes to our processes actually are improvements."
"I am not sure whether some of the recommendations in the current report are improvements."
"For example, a recommendation to remove the bathrooms within this building will prove very costly, as will the proposal to replace the whole fleet of European Parliament cars."
"There are also some recommendations within the report that are already included in the 2011 budget proposals. Examples include a review of Europarl TV to make sure it is effective and is doing its job, and also the call for a long-term building strategy, which is already in place or is at least called for in the future."
"There are also some recommendations within the report that cover issues where improvements have already been made or are in the process of being made."
"However, there are, of course, some positives in the report, and these should indeed be supported - for example, the reduction in paper wasted in printing."
"We all see piles of paper printed every day and surely there must be some scope for reduction there."
"Also welcome is the call for a rationalisation of external studies, and cooperation with other institutions on those studies, so that we can avoid duplication and make some efficiency savings."
"I understand some amendments will be put forward again for the 2011 European Parliament budget."
"The report also asks for an annual report from the risk manager, and again I think that is a good thing."
"All this demonstrates that there is a need for a balance in the discussions we have on the discharge for the European Parliament."
"I have no doubt that the Budgetary Control Committee will ensure that it exercises its responsibilities in future and will want to report in the future on how the recommendations in this report are being implemented and dealt with."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say I was happy that I only had to travel to Strasbourg this week and not to Brussels, because Strasbourg is much closer for me and therefore it was a great advantage to be able to travel unhindered despite the interruption in flight connections."
"My second request regards budgetary control."
"We still have the same old pack of paper that shows what is going through plenary this week."
"I would be pleased if we could receive a computer here in our workstations, particularly since we can view everything electronically, so that when voting, we then have the amendments in our own languages in front of us and the vote can be carried out in a targeted manner."
"We have hundreds of votes, always at midday, and it would be good if we did not have to haul the paper around with us, but had the texts provided in electronic form."
"After all, the European Parliament should be at the leading edge of technology."
"Thirdly, when we travel somewhere, we then have all the accounting to do, which has recently become very bureaucratic."
"It is a large additional burden for us as MEPs, but also for the administration of the House."
"The additional audit imposes additional conditions."
"We should establish a working party here that reverts to what is essential - correct and precise accounting - in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden by 25%, and not raise it by 50%, as has happened in recent months."
"As far as structure is concerned, I would ask the Commission to check whether, since many countries are currently in crisis in terms of the financial situation, we should focus more on investments in the Cohesion Fund and the Regional Fund and not so much on the consumption of European funding."
"Even an increase of funds to 1.27% of Gross National Income (GNI) would be sensible in order to achieve more in investment activities."
"(RO) I would like to begin by mentioning the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008, Section III - Commission and executive agencies."
"We welcome the voluntary initiatives launched by Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom in producing national management statements."
"We firmly believe that progress will be achieved when national management declarations will be received for all the European Union's funds which are subject to shared management."
"In this regard, we urge the Commission to produce recommendations on drafting these management statements."
"With regard to the research framework programme, we are concerned that the current programme does not meet the needs of a modern research environment."
"We feel that modernisation and additional simplification must be carried out for the future framework programme."
"I would also like to mention the implementation of the budget of the European Network and Information Security Agency for the financial year 2008."
"It is indicated in this agency's accounts that revenue was recorded, which was accrued from interest amounting to more than EUR 143 000 for the financial year 2008, which highlights that the agency has a high volume of liquidity over long periods."
"In this regard, we urge the Commission to examine not only the possibilities for fully implementing cash management based on needs, but also, in particular, the extension of ENISA's mandate both beyond 2012 and as regards competences."
"(DE) Mr President, if we want a European Union that is accepted by its citizens, then it is crucial that citizens also know what is being done with the money they pay in taxes."
"Therefore, Mrs Schaldemose's demand for more transparency is perfectly justified and I believe this is where the European project stands or falls."
"However, it is not just about transparency, it is also about readability."
"We are, as it were, paid to deal with such matters full-time."
"I think that when they occasionally look at such a document, citizens should also be able to do something concrete with it."
"Thus, we must call on the Commission to work on the readability of its documents, in particular, those concerning the budgetary framework."
"Then citizens would know very quickly how large or small the EU budget is and how much is always demanded of the EU."
"The fact that Member States expect the EU to do something but, on the other hand, are not so ready to provide any money, is a political problem that we all have, and this is a field that the Commission should tackle in the coming years."
"(DE) Mr President, a few words on the particularly critical discussion concerning the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance for Turkey."
"This has increased steadily since 2002, although Turkey is taking more steps backward than forward."
"The latest special report by the Court of Auditors reveals major problems."
"Funds were not spent effectively and were not sufficiently evaluated."
"I therefore call on the Commission to go out and explain to EU citizens before discharge what exactly has happened to the EUR 800 million a year for Turkey."
"Now to the different agencies in general."
"The uncontrolled growth, the establishment, reestablishment and expansion of EU agencies, which has almost tripled since 2000, clearly contradicts the demands of the Lisbon Strategy for less bureaucracy."
"This also includes the new European Asylum Support Office."
"Although we are talking about 2008, a word on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction."
"I would really like to know whether it was asleep when, at the beginning of the year, hard drugs were legalised in the Czech Republic and now, thanks to open borders, we have fabulous drug tourism."
"So we are tough as nails with smokers, but are caught napping when it comes to hard drugs."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to address the issue of pre-accession aid."
"The Court of Auditors says clearly in its report that it is not in a position to prove the proper utilisation of funds on the basis of current programmes."
"The European Commission has therefore established programmes that we cannot monitor and whose effectiveness we cannot check."
"In its opinion, the Committee on Budgetary Control delivered a clear position, and now there is unbelievable lobbying by the Turkish side."
"With regard to budget discharge, the question here is not whether or not Turkey will join the EU."
"It is not about whether or not we want to please representatives of other friendly countries, it is about us checking whether the programmes are really effective, it is about money reaching those it is intended for and not being drained off somewhere."
"It is also about us handling European citizens' tax money properly."
"Therefore, I would be very grateful if the majority of the House could make the right decision when it is finally up for the vote."
"Mr President, I represent a party that is opposed to the whole EU project and to our country's membership of the EU."
"This might lead people to suspect that we would object to the discharge of accounts regardless of the evidence."
"I would like to reject that suspicion."
"Whilst our default position would be to object to the approval of almost all future expenditure, I had hoped that we would support the discharge of accounts for past expenditure if the evidence justified it, even if we disapproved of the purposes of that expenditure."
"However, we shall oppose the discharge of the accounts as a whole because of the quantity of irregularities."
"We would not confuse judgment of the regularity or irregularity of expenditure with approval or disapproval of the purpose."
"I hope that all others, whether they approve of the purposes of the expenditure or not, will take the same approach."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing discharge of the 2008 budget, but discharge is always an opportunity to look ahead and I feel that in this context in particular, we must focus on the many agencies that we have introduced."
"We certainly must provide these agencies with financial resources but we must also ensure that they can do substantive work."
"I am thinking of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which is responsible for the chemical industry and which is to assume additional duties in the coming period and is to be responsible for biocides."
"We must ensure that efficient, forward-looking work is done that also corresponds to our policies, and therefore I ask that we all ensure that these agencies are able to work well and efficiently for us in the future too."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to stress once more the Commission's commitment to pursuing the progress we have made over the last years in order to further improve the quality of spending."
"I will, of course, look carefully at the discharge decisions that the European Parliament will adopt in two weeks' time, and the Commission will ensure appropriate follow-up."
"I would also like to thank you for a very good discussion today."
"I think that many good ideas were expressed during the discussion, and I would like to look at a few of them."
"Firstly, regarding national management declarations, an issue raised by Bart Staes and other Members, I would just remind you that, together with Commissioner Lewandowski, we sent a letter to the Committee on Budgetary Control saying that we will make a proposal regarding national management declarations in the forthcoming revision of the Financial Regulation."
"I think that, together with proposals on simplification and with the introduction of the concept of tolerable risk of error, this will allow significant improvements in the situation with the management of structural funds."
"Mr SÃ¸ndergaard was very concerned about this."
"The issue of the role of internal audits and internal controls was raised by Mrs Herczog."
"I fully share her view on this and would just say that next week, we will discuss the audit strategy for 2010-12 and will pay much more attention to the improvement of internal control systems in the Commission."
"I also share the views expressed by Mr Audy and some other honourable Members about the discharge procedure."
"I think that we have to launch a discussion on how to improve the discharge procedure in order to ensure that most of the discharge results are implemented as fast as possible."
"It is now 2010 and we are discussing the discharge for 2008, as it was impossible to implement anything during 2009."
"I think that a thorough discussion involving stakeholders and the Court of Auditors is needed."
"I fully share your views and the views of other Members who talked about this issue."
"I also think that it is very important to address the issue of the efficiency of the spending of EU funds."
"In our general audit strategy, we pay great attention to the improvement of auditing in terms of also auditing the efficiency of EU spending."
"I think that this will give us results in the future."
"On Turkey, the Commission will follow up the recommendations to improve the objectives and the monitoring of progress."
"For all areas of spending, we have to improve the quality of spending, from objective setting to impact evaluation."
"The results achieved so far demonstrate that the European Union is pursuing its efforts to improve the way that taxpayers' money is spent and adds value to our citizens."
"This progress is also the result of your action as the discharge authority, always being attentive to the way the EU budget is used, critical when it is not satisfactory, but also supportive when progress is made."
"This is an important message to convey to citizens of the EU."
"Therefore, let me conclude by expressing my special thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Commission's efforts towards better financial management of the European Union's budget."
"Mr President, so that the Minutes are correct, I represent rapporteur BogusÅaw Liberadzki, who, like many others in this House, has been a victim of the transport problems this week."
"I am very happy to do so and would like to use the opportunity to go over a few of the remarks made during the debate."
"For a start, Commissioner Å emeta, to my great satisfaction, you have stressed that the Commission will take steps to further strengthen the accountability of the leading actors in the management of EU funds."
"We all know what that means."
"Indeed, we all know that it means that we must remind the Member States of the European Union that manage a large portion of European funds of their responsibility to do so in accordance with good practice, because we also all know that the majority of the errors that are made in the utilisation of European funds are made by the Member States and at this level."
"That is why it is also rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, all of whom, including Mr Czarnecki, have other commitments, strongly criticising the Commission in the debate and saying that the Commission will be refused discharge."
"I would have expected my fellow Members to support pushing for national management statements in this House and also in the Member States, because that is where mistakes are being made and there is insufficient cooperation."
"Then it is rather unsatisfactory to hear colleagues from the ECR Group say that everything that happens here is substandard - knowing quite well that responsibility lies somewhere else entirely."
"Once again, I would like to mention pre-accession aid, because I feel that a few things have to be put right there."
"I would like to remind you that the Committee on Budgetary Control supported the rapporteur with a slight majority."
"I would also like to remind you that during the reporting, the representative of the European Court of Auditors sought to remind the rapporteur that his report was about the behaviour of the Commission as regards what was deemed to be worthy of criticism, not about the behaviour of Turkey."
"Our fellow Members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have voted amendments into the discharge of the Commission that we would like to remove straightaway, because here it is obviously less about the utilisation of taxpayers' money and more about the question of where accession negotiations with Turkey are going."
"Deciding that at this point is the wrong way to go."
"Mr President, in my concluding speech, I would like to thank Commissioner Å emeta and the Commission services responsible for development aid and humanitarian aid for their diligent and effective cooperation in this process."
"I also wish to give the Spanish Presidency due recognition for the efforts it is making in this discharge procedure, especially its offer to launch a debate on renewing the interinstitutional agreement with the Council, since the current one has clearly been obsolete for some time."
"However, I must also express my rejection of the improvised procedure of this Chamber, which clearly had not thought of formally inviting either the Court of Auditors or the Council until 09.00 today."
"Criticising their absence when we had not even taken the trouble to invite them appears to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and bad faith."
"I believe that if we want to be respected and able to meet our new responsibilities, our interinstitutional procedures must be more rigorous and serious, and less opportunistic."
"To conclude the debate on discharge for the European Development Funds, I only wish to express my gratitude for the excellent cooperation I have enjoyed with my colleagues, particularly Mrs Hohlmeier, and to welcome the major improvements achieved in the effective and transparent implementation of European development aid."
"Of all the positive actions that come out of the European Union's work, the citizens are particularly appreciative of European development aid and even call for it to be more visible and more extensive."
"However, they also become concerned if it is not made clear why we help certain governments with budgetary aid, or if we do not explain the reasons or provide sufficient guarantees of strict control in cases where circumstances change due to coups d'Ã©tat, corruption scandals, violations of human rights or setbacks on the road towards democracy or gender equality."
"The significant progress we have seen and noted is good reason for us to discharge the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds, but we shall have to continue making improvements."
"This Parliament will remain particularly watchful to ensure that the new post-Lisbon interinstitutional system and the European External Action Service framework do not jeopardise the improvements that have been achieved, so that citizens can continue to feel proud of European development aid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should, of course, like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken about my report, particularly Mr ItÃ¤lÃ¤, Mr Gerbrandy, Mrs Herczog, Mr Geier, Mr van Dalen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mrs de Lange and Mr Vaughan."
"I believe that everything has been said, although I must express my surprise about the production of this report."
"It is the third time I have been rapporteur for the European Parliament discharge, and I sense a change in perception."
"The first and second times, it was relatively easy to make criticisms in this House."
"The third time it has been harder."
"It is clear that, suddenly, this House has become more touchy, and quite possibly lacking in self-criticism."
"In the press, I have had some people accusing me, some of my fellow Members challenging me on this, saying: this is all well and good, but what you are writing puts wind in the sails of the Eurosceptics."
"I disagree: I am an MEP who is both pro-European and critical, and if I come across things I believe could be improved or changed, or things such as the voluntary pension fund that have been associated with impropriety in the past, it is my duty to say so."
"We pro-European MEPs must point these things out, as this is the way to take the wind out of the sails of the Eurosceptics, who subsist on half-truths - sometimes out-and-out lies - of this kind."
"It is up to us to tell it as it is, and I shall always do so;"
"I shall never gloss over abuses."
"That is my basic position."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Geier, who has noticed that I sometimes say what I think."
"I must say I am going to learn wonderful things from the Council's representative - a Spanish minister who always disappears when he knows the Council is going to be criticised."
"He was not here at the beginning when I spoke, and he is not here now, when I want to speak again."
"It is no accident that, of the seven institutions which I have had occasion to assess, six of them are more or less in order, and one is the cause of continual problems."
"I will remind everyone that a year ago, it was the same."
"The Council was granted discharge only in November."
"I do think this will happen earlier this year, but I would not want to allow a situation in which we receive a document, not for the year 2008, but for 2007."
"This shows either that there is chaos in the General Secretariat of the Council or that they are treating Parliament like an unintelligent schoolboy."
"A situation in which all European institutions are equal but the Council thinks it is more equal, just like in George Orwell's Animal Farm, is a situation which is highly alarming."
"I do think, however - and let us be fair - that in what the Council representative said, there was one very important proposal."
"This concerns the departure, as I understand it, from the famous gentlemen's agreement of 1970, and so is a recognition that the Parliament of 40 years ago, which was then still nominated by national parliaments and not chosen in elections, should now be treated more seriously."
"Departure from that gentlemen's agreement is a very good move, for which I am very grateful to the Council."
"I think I proposed such an oral amendment at the vote in May."
"Mr President, I wish to thank, firstly, the shadow rapporteurs, who really cooperated very effectively with me in order to draft this report, and, secondly, all the members of the Committee's secretariat, because this was a very demanding task."
"I also wish to thank those Members who have spoken during these debates, and I fully share their concerns."
"It was evident from their speeches that they want to increase the transparency and the monitoring of EU funds, which is completely understandable."
"I should like, in my conclusion, to also point out that the agencies in question have a political role too - this must be pointed out, it is also very important - and that, in order to carry out this important political role effectively, they have a work programme."
"This work programme really must be consistent with that of the European Union and must - this is my hope - be monitored by our three institutions."
"Indeed, while certain agencies cooperate naturally and spontaneously with them, others are far less receptive and, in such cases, our institutions' texts have no binding force."
"We need to think very seriously about this, Mr President."
"I should add briefly that the services have informed me that they have quickly gone through the minutes of recent years."
"During the last legislative period, the Council adopted a position and appeared in the debate once, and that was only in a second reading, because the discharge had originally been postponed in 2009 and the Council was only present in the second round."
"In this respect, the perception that we are on the road to improvement is certainly not wrong."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the May part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has to be a paragon in terms of financial transparency and internal budgetary control."
"We cannot be hard enough on ourselves in this regard."
"In such a large parliament, with so many Members and members of staff, things cannot work perfectly all the time."
"Wherever there are people working together, things will go wrong."
"Even the strictest internal controls cannot prevent that."
"Yet we must also recognise that great efforts have been made in recent years to put things right."
"I should like to give two examples."
"Firstly, the new Statute for Assistants, which is in place at long last following years of discussion."
"The abuses that existed have now been virtually eliminated."
"The second example is the reimbursement of expenses."
"Action has been taken and clear and precise rules introduced in this field, too."
"Has this solved all the problems?"
"Absolutely not."
"It is to be welcomed that internal controls have been further tightened, but giving the vague impression that things are being covered up is unacceptable in my eyes, as it is not true."
"I should like to conclude by saying with regard to future budget increases that we must have the courage to explain to the public that the Treaty of Lisbon means a great deal of extra work, and that a higher budget for communication and contact with visitors is indeed justified."
"in writing. - Generally, we are pleased to see the current state of affairs regarding the budget of the European Union."
"However, there is still room for improvement."
"Significant improvement, I would say."
"Ceterum censeo, France has decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that She will sincerely regret that action."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.00 and resumed at 15.00)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"SWIFT (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on SWIFT."
"Mr President, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, last month, on 24 March, the Commission adopted a recommendation to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations between the European Union and the United States for an agreement whereby finance messaging data are made available to the US Treasury Department in order to fight and prevent terrorism and its financing."
"The recommendation was immediately submitted to the rapporteur and certain Members of the European Parliament and forwarded to the Council of the Union."
"The Council of the Union remains convinced of the need for an agreement like this one and therefore fully supports the Commission's recommendation to negotiate an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme."
"The Commissioner's draft mandate has been closely studied within Coreper and, in principle, this Commission recommendation will be put to the vote at the next Council meeting and we will vote in favour of it, taking into account Parliament's position, of course, and the opinions that will be voiced on the subject here in this Chamber today."
"The Council agrees with Parliament that the future agreement, known as the SWIFT agreement, must include adequate guarantees and safeguards."
"It agrees, therefore, with the feeling shown by Parliament that it is essential in all cases to comply with the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, specifically Article 8 thereof, the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In addition, there are fundamental principles that must be respected when personal data are transferred, such as the right of the person whose data are being processed to be informed, or the right to amend or delete such data if they are incorrect."
"All rights relating to data protection must be guaranteed without discrimination; in other words, citizens of the European Union must be treated in the same way as citizens of the United States."
"We believe there can be an agreement on the duration of the agreement to be signed with the United States, which I hope will be approximately five years."
"As for exchanging data with third countries, our understanding is that, when the US authorities have grounds to think that there are data that may help authorities in other countries to prosecute terrorist crimes, such data should be used."
"That, moreover, is precisely what European legislation permits."
"According to European legislation, under similar circumstances where a Member State has obtained information from other Member States, that information may be transferred to third states for the purpose of fighting terrorism."
"Then there is the subject of data transfers in bulk and not in all cases tied to a specific assumption, which is something that has to be kept for technical reasons and also for reasons of effectiveness, since it is often important to have a certain volume of data from which to draw conclusions when prosecuting terrorism."
"Such data transfers must, of course, be as specific and as restricted as possible and there must always be a very clear objective: the prosecution of certain terrorist crimes, which is the objective that justifies the existence of this kind of agreement."
"As a result, we have a detailed draft mandate from the Commission."
"I believe it is a good draft, one that safeguards people's fundamental rights, takes account of the effectiveness of these agreements, is based on reciprocity, is based on proportionality in the collection of data."
"It is certainly based on the oversight of the results of the effectiveness of these agreements - as also alluded to in the Commission's recommendation - not least by Parliament, which is absolutely associated with the whole of these negotiations."
"Parliament rightly considers that it, too, must be involved in this agreement, and we therefore agree that it should be provided with adequate information and that the Commission, as the negotiator of this agreement, should pass on that information at each stage in the negotiations."
"The Council also understands that Parliament should have easier access to the classified parts of international agreements so that it can carry out its assessment in cases where it has a right of approval."
"Moreover, I must mention that in its statement of 9 February 2010, the Council promised to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement with Parliament on this topic."
"On behalf of the Council, I am pleased to confirm that promise today."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the collection of TFTP data is important in the fight against terrorism."
"We know that TFTP data has been helpful to prevent terrorist attacks in Europe, like the 2006 liquid bombs at Heathrow Airport."
"The TFTP is therefore important, not only for the US, but also for Europe."
"I recently met US Home Secretary Napolitano and we addressed this issue."
"They are fully aware of the need to reform the intermediate agreement that we had but they are also concerned about a number of leads for known terrorists, which are no longer available."
"So we need to address the security gap but also to do this in a way that ensures full respect of fundamental rights and a sufficient level of data protection."
"That is why, after our last discussion on this, the Commission promptly started to work on a new mandate for a new EU-US TFTP Agreement."
"I think the mandate is ambitious but realistic."
"It balances the maintenance of our collective security, while addressing fundamental rights and data protection, based on Parliament's resolutions of September last year and of February this year."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, for the very constructive cooperation we have had."
"The Commission has tried to liaise with her and the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in this matter."
"I am also grateful to the Presidency for the work they have done to try to get this through the Council."
"We have tried to take on board the concerns expressed in the European Parliament resolutions."
"Data will be processed only for the purpose of terrorism."
"A request must be based on judicial authorisation."
"Third parties will not get bulk data."
"There will be reciprocity."
"There will be the push basis for transfer, SEPA data will be excluded and we will also address the issue of judicial redress on a non-discriminatory basis."
"I will ensure that the Commission will keep Parliament fully and immediately informed throughout the process of negotiations."
"We aim to sign this agreement before the end of June, so that Parliament can vote on it in July."
"On the question of 'bulk' data transfer, I know this is of great concern to the European Parliament but I also know that you do understand that, without bulk transfers, there will be no TFTP."
"However, legally binding safeguards will ensure that absolutely no data are accessed unless there is an objectively verified reason to believe that an identified person is a terrorist, a suspected terrorist, or is financing terrorism and that those data transfers are anonymous."
"Transfer of bulk data is, of course, sensitive, and we will strive for further reductions in the volume of data during the negotiations."
"But we also need to be realistic here."
"We are unlikely to see a huge reduction in what are already targeted requests."
"Reciprocity is part of the mandate."
"The envisaged agreement would place a legal obligation on the US Treasury to share leads with their EU counterparts and allow EU authorities to have TFTP searches undertaken against known terrorist suspects in the EU."
"Should the EU develop something similar - an EU TFTP - the Americans should help us in this as well."
"The Commission is willing to participate in these discussions with Member States."
"The mandate calls for a five-year retention period for non-extracted data."
"I believe there is some justification in this, bearing in mind that five years is also the period for financial transaction data that banks are subject to under EU anti-money-laundering legislation, but I am ready to hear Parliament's views on this and take this matter to the Council by the end of the week."
"In conclusion, I believe that the draft mandate is a true substantial improvement."
"It takes into account the concerns of Parliament raised in your resolutions."
"It takes into account the rapporteur's call for a double-track approach that might lead to an EU TFTP, even if this is, of course, something that we have to discuss internally in the EU."
"It is not part of the negotiations."
"It does take account of the EU-US relationship in this area as equal partners, which is, of course, the long-term goal in this regard."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the first thing that should be said is that this Parliament wants an agreement."
"Of course this Parliament does not want an agreement at any cost, and the devil is in the detail."
"This is what we shall be discussing today in this Chamber."
"After the vote in February, two clear lessons were learnt."
"The first lesson is that the European Parliament has new powers, it has clear powers; it has a say and it wants to exercise those powers."
"It will do so constructively and responsibly, but it will exercise its powers."
"The second lesson that has been learnt is that the first agreement was not good enough and it needs to be improved."
"I very much welcome the Commission's readiness to come out with a mandate, as it did as soon as possible after the vote in February, and I am also very keen to have this mandate approved as soon as possible by the Council of Ministers."
"As I said, the European Parliament wants an agreement and we have put the details of what we would like in the resolution that has found the broad support of this House, certainly of the leading groups in this House."
"Madam Commissioner, bulk data is an issue for us and you will know very well that what we want on bulk data will require a rethink, not just on the part of our counterparts in the US but also on our own part."
"What exactly do we, here in Europe, want for ourselves?"
"Do we want our own European TFTP, and how will we go about achieving that?"
"Clearly, bulk data is an issue and it is an issue that cannot be skirted round. It needs to be faced."
"Next week, we shall be facing these details when we discuss them with our counterparts in Congress in the US, when a mission from this Parliament goes to the US."
"Next week, a mission from the European Parliament will go to the US and we shall discuss this with our counterparts in Congress, but also with the US authorities."
"We are keen to do that in a constructive manner."
"We want to go there to show the US authorities that we mean business."
"We want an agreement, but we have concerns and we want those concerns to be addressed."
"Mr President, I would like to contradict those who have spoken so far on one point: I am not interested in arriving at an agreement as soon as possible, but in achieving one that is as good as possible."
"Quality must come before timeframe."
"I would like to make one other preliminary remark."
"The European Parliament has already rejected an agreement once and one aspect among the many reasons relating to content was the lack of European Parliament participation."
"In view of current events this week, we have decided not to adopt any decisions here in Parliament."
"Then there is the decision to call on the Council to likewise postpone its decisions until we can adopt our decisions."
"I am now rather surprised that there are Members of the House, who clearly do not take their own decisions seriously but think: well yes, despite this, the Council can simply decide."
"I do not think we can treat our own decisions like that."
"I still maintain that the Council should also withhold its decision until after 6 May when we have decided."
"I am sure there are no disadvantages to this and that the United States would be understanding."
"As for the draft mandate itself, I take a favourable view of the fact that the Commission is committed to meeting our demands."
"Nevertheless, I would like to say clearly that there still need to be substantial amendments to this negotiating mandate."
"These are necessary if a majority of the European Parliament is to vote in favour of a new agreement."
"In my opinion, the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this."
"The problem of bulk data transfer remains unresolved."
"If the US authorities tell us that every month we are talking about the specific details of five to ten people, then the transfer of millions of pieces of data relating to European citizens is surely disproportionate to this purpose."
"Incidentally, I would like to say again to the Commission and the Council that although it is constantly maintained that this agreement will be highly significant as an additional means of combating terrorism, the proof of this is not as clear as we are always being told."
"The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem."
"The mandate does not offer a solution here either."
"We need a judicial authority on European soil that not only checks the legality of US applications, but also the extraction of data, wherever this takes place."
"The transmission of information to third countries must be regulated with clear directives."
"We need an ambitious mandate with our demands."
"Only then can we achieve a really good result that meets our demands, taking into account data protection as well as the fight against terror."
"Finally, I have another specific question for the Council and the Commission."
"How do you intend to ensure that only data that was specifically requested is extracted and passed on?"
"How can that work?"
"In the United States?"
"Or are there other proposals?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I, too, very much welcome today's debate where Parliament will set out its expectations with regard to the negotiations directives."
"The fact that Parliament will not vote on its resolution this week is clearly very unfortunate but it should not, and I repeat, it should not inhibit Council from going ahead with the adoption as scheduled."
"Parliament's views are being put forward as we speak, and it is no secret that Council and the Commission are already fully aware of the resolution and its content."
"In this respect, I can only say that I do appreciate the new spirit of cooperation demonstrated by both the Council and the Commission to engage with this House."
"Now, following the negotiations directive, the envisaged EU-US agreement is to ensure rights on an equal basis, regardless of the nationality of any person whose data are processed in accordance with the agreement."
"Now, my question is, what does that mean?"
"What are these specific rights in that case in relation to, for example, access, rectification, deletion, compensation and redress?"
"Please enlighten me here."
"Furthermore, I would like to underline, like my colleagues did, that the principles of proportionalities and necessity are key to the envisaged agreement."
"The fact, and I repeat it once more, the fact that financial measuring data profiles are unable, for whatever reason, to search the content of the messages leading to the transfer of data in bulk cannot be subsequently rectified by mechanisms of oversight and control, as basic principles of data protection law have already been comprised."
"To be honest, I do have some doubts whether this issue is going to be solved on the basis of the current negotiations directives."
"Furthermore, it is important to know that the agreement on mutual legal assistance is not an adequate basis for requests to obtain data for the purposes of the TFTP."
"After all, the agreement on mutual legal assistance does not apply to bank transfers between third countries and it would demand prior identification of a specific bank whereas the TFCP is based on searches for fund transfers."
"It is therefore crucial, and I would like to stress that, it is therefore crucial that negotiations focus on finding a solution to make one compatible with the other."
"We can, of course, insist on a redesign of the TFTP but honestly, in the end, this is not in our hands really and I can therefore only urge the Council and the Commission, like Mr Busuttil did, to address the fundamental policy decisions straight away."
"I do expect a clear and binding commitment on the part of both the Council and the Commission to undertake all that is necessary to effectively introduce a durable, legally sound, European solution to the extraction of data on European soil."
"Let me stress once more that the transfer and storage of data in bulk to a foreign power, even if it concerns our best friends, is and remains by definition, disproportionate."
"It marks a huge departure from EU legislation and practice."
"The rule of law is crucially important and in this context, Parliament must be extremely mindful in assessing envisaged agreements such as the one we are discussing today."
"I do support, like others, a strong outwards-looking EU that is capable of acting shoulder to shoulder, as an equal partner, with the US."
"In that framework, I can only underline once more that it is the EU that needs to lay down the principles on how Europe will cooperate with the US for counterterrorism purposes, including law enforcement and the use of data collected for commercial ends."
"Getting it right should be the objective, and the European legal demands for the fair, proportionate and lawful processing of personal information are of paramount importance and must always be upheld."
"Now it is for the Council and the Commission to put this into concrete action as soon as possible and to negotiate an agreement that meets all of the EU and US expectations."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Presidency and you, Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m, for what you have said."
"The Presidency has rightly said that the TFTP agreement on the exchange of SWIFT bank data is about principles."
"It is about fundamental constitutional principles, it is about the protection of privacy - Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"However, it is also about effective legal protection and fair procedures - Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is about genuine proportionality from a constitutional legal point of view, and I stress from a constitutional legal point of view, because it is not about simply getting a feel for proportionality; we need actual evidence of the need for, and suitability of, a measure and finally also evidence of the proportionality itself."
"Here, I again have to make clear what other experts and even the investigative authorities have said repeatedly."
"In my opinion, it cannot be proven that the mass transfer of personal data without specific initial suspicions is at all appropriate and that we do not have significantly less intensive means of intervention that would suffice to pursue these goals."
"Without a prior decision in an individual case on the basis of existing suspicions, any access to the bank data of European citizens is disproportionate."
"It must therefore be ensured that there is no bulk transfer of data."
"Otherwise, this agreement would represent a breach of existing European and international treaties, and that is exactly what most European supreme courts have made very clear in rulings up to this point - in particular, the German Federal Constitutional Court in March - when it was a matter of data retention."
"Therefore, Parliament cannot and should not make any compromises on its previous positions, but must ensure compatibility with EU law during and after negotiations, if need be then by all means with the presentation of the mandate and the results of the negotiations before the European Court of Justice."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to clearly present Parliament's conditions to the United States and to provide the necessary clear evidence of proportionality."
"Otherwise, Parliament will remain unable to agree to a TFTP agreement."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the ECR Group supported the Council's original agreement on SWIFT with the United States and its terrorist-financed tracking programme for the transfer of financial messaging data, subject, of course, to certain safeguards."
"We repudiated at the time the anti-Americanism, both latent and overt, that characterises some in this House."
"America bears a vastly disproportionate burden worldwide for securing the liberty of us all."
"We want to see the EU doing more, not less, to support America's principled leadership in the fight against terrorism."
"We therefore saw the SWIFT agreement as a vital tool to help excise the cancer of terrorist financing and to protect citizens on both sides of the Atlantic."
"However, whilst I was saddened to see the deal voted down, I was not altogether surprised."
"Undoubtedly, Parliament was flexing its muscles and keen to make a show of its new powers under the Lisbon Treaty, but the temporary demise of the SWIFT accord until the better current proposal was forthcoming from the Commission could perhaps ultimately be for the good, to serve as a wake-up call to President Obama's Administration which, like its predecessors, appears to have a very sketchy grasp of the EU and its institutions, notably Parliament."
"There seems to be little appreciation amongst American diplomats of the increased powers and influence of MEPs."
"The letter sent by Secretary Clinton to President Buzek, raising concerns regarding SWIFT, was woefully late in the day."
"Moreover, it was considered by many Members of this House as at best naive, and at worst arrogant, because it ignored the reality of how our Parliament operates through the political groups."
"The United States maintains an almost invisible lobbying presence in the Parliament."
"Compare that to small countries like Israel, Taiwan and Colombia, not to mention giants like India and China, which invest substantial diplomatic resources in building relationships in this House."
"As a result, they punch above their weight diplomatically at EU level, whereas America falls woefully short of its potential."
"It is extraordinary that the USA's bilateral embassy to Belgium is still double the size of its mission to the European Union."
"I am, however, heartened that the new American Ambassador to the EU, William Kennard, seems to appreciate MEPs' importance, and this is now being conveyed back to Washington."
"I hope that his time in Brussels coincides with a quantum leap in terms of America's relationship with us MEPs, and the announced visit by Vice-President Biden is an excellent start, because no one wants to see the transatlantic partnership strengthened more than I do."
"The next hurdle, of course, will be getting a new agreement on SWIFT through this House, but also one on passenger name records (PNR), which, in my view, will prove no less controversial."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, we are discussing the Commission's and the Council's mandate in relation to the SWIFT project."
"The draft mandate being submitted to us today certainly takes up some of the demands made by the European Parliament in its resolution of September 2009, but many points remain incomplete."
"This is the case when it comes to the length of time in which the data are stored and the possibilities for our fellow EU citizens to lodge an appeal."
"The US Privacy Act still discriminates against non-US citizens: even Commission officials admit that."
"Furthermore, we are repeatedly told that SWIFT cannot process data on an individual basis because it does not have the capabilities, particularly the technical capabilities, to do so."
"Therefore, there is still a huge problem as regards the proportionality of the transfers carried out."
"As you yourself have just told us, Commissioner, there are still concerns in relation to these bulk data transfers."
"I am sorry but, as far as I am concerned, I have no faith in the way in which the US authorities operate in this area."
"Reasonable suspicion cannot be enough."
"The damage caused by the United States in the fight against terrorism is well known."
"As Mrs Sippel said, quality must take precedence over quantity."
"Yes, a European authority should be able to have actual control over the data that will be transferred."
"We are still awaiting guarantees in this area to safeguard the rights of our fellow citizens and of all those resident in Europe."
"We welcome the progress that has already been made, but it is still not enough."
"Yes, our fellow citizens have a right to security, but they have a right to it in all areas."
"At a time when many of our fellow citizens are becoming more aware of the protection of privacy and of personal data - something that is coming across clearly in many of the speeches in this House - we have a duty to continue to alert you and to tell you, in all conscience, that, for us, the principles of necessity and of proportionality are still not being respected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I take this opportunity to highlight the legitimacy of your point that the European Parliament must not forget, either, the role and the importance of the Italian language, of the use of the Italian language, which has contributed so much to European culture."
"Returning to the subject at hand, it must be said that, ultimately, after that standstill pursued strongly by the European Parliament, which, on this occasion, seemed perhaps not to have fully appreciated the urgent, dramatic need not to undermine in any way, for any reason, a fundamental requirement of the West and of Europe, that of defending itself from terrorism."
"Of course, it is absolutely true that there has to be a balance, a proportionality, that citizens' rights and privacy rights must not be sacrificed beyond measure and that the possibility for citizens to lodge an appeal, either an administrative appeal or a legal appeal, against any decisions taken on the basis of the SWIFT system must, of course, be guaranteed - just as this new wording by the Commission, which has accepted many of the most important points made by the European Parliament, guarantees."
"Therefore, in my view, the guidelines in the negotiating mandate adopted by the Commission on SWIFT should be regarded as essentially sound, in terms of ensuring, I repeat, effective and necessary cooperation with the US authorities as regards the tracking of financial transactions to combat and prevent the terrorist threat - this, of course, being in the bilateral interest, since Europe, too, must remember that it needs to defend itself from terrorism; we have seen too much obvious, and also extremely serious, evidence of terrorism - and of ensuring the democratic control of the data flow entrusted to the European Parliament, which is thus the most reliable form of protection there can be for European citizens' personal data and the protection of their right to assert themselves in all appropriate forums."
"The mandate also takes on board many suggestions offered by us MEPs, and this speaks volumes for the importance of the European Parliament and for the new role granted to it by the treaty."
"Furthermore, we must remember that the agreement provides for reciprocity from the United States should the European Union succeed in launching a European terrorist finance tracking programme."
"Europe must swing into action - in any case, it must not always trail behind - it must swing into action and must itself provide vital input and information."
"On the PNR system, which will be discussed later, the same logic applies: a passenger recognition measure, once again for the purposes of combating terrorism, is absolutely crucial."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) want an agreement."
"We want a good partnership with our American friends, above all, in the area of security."
"We want a good agreement and we want this agreement very soon."
"We should emphasise that this is a time that reflects the spirit of Lisbon as seldom before."
"After Parliament's resolution in mid September, after the Council's decisions at the end of November, after the discussions in January/February and after Parliament's clear position in February, we now have a situation that is a good example of cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"I would really like to thank you, Commissioner, and also the Council, for this new beginning, that was started primarily by you and Commissioner Reding."
"It is an example of what European citizens want in terms of scope for action, of how European citizens want to see us reach solutions together - not just European citizens, but, above all, those who are watching and listening in this House today."
"At this point I would particularly like to welcome our friends from the Rhine and HunsrÃ¼ck and our friends from Austria who are here today."
"We in our group are not looking for problems, but fighting for solutions."
"I should emphasise that a whole range of excellent proposals for solutions were found that we set out in September's resolution, be it on the issue of bulk data, third countries, duration, terminability, or other matters."
"These are the matters we need to negotiate on now."
"I am rather surprised by our colleagues from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left who, at the time, refrained from voting on the resolution and refused to contribute, but are now calling for this resolution."
"I therefore invite you to come on board. Help us negotiate and together, we will bring about a good result."
"As has been considered here, we should, in future, also work to ensure that we accelerate the development of the TFTP and you have also said that in your statements."
"Yes, we will need these instruments and we should keep the schedule exactly as it was conceived by you, so that we can discuss the results of your negotiations here in Parliament before the end of summer and will also hopefully reach decisions."
"I believe that the way you have held discussions, including on your action plan that I would like to support wholeheartedly, can continue in this vein on matters concerning the data agreement, Passenger Name Records (PNR), the Schengen Information System (SIS) and other issues."
"(HU) I would like to recall that, contrary to earlier negative expectations that preceded Parliament's negative vote, there have, in fact, been several positive developments as well, and it seems that there will be a better than expected agreement between the European Union and the United States; if all goes well, it will be concluded by the summer."
"Since that time, it has first of all become clear to us that the US is far more open to these reservations and to finding constructive solutions to the European reservations than we had previously thought."
"I think that we have all found that cooperation is better and the dialogue between the Council and Parliament is closer, and I think it is also important that Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m regularly informs the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the developments."
"I think this is the key to ensuring that good agreements do indeed continue to be reached in the future."
"I think it is important to state this, before going any further."
"I, too, would like to say what several people have emphasised, namely that Parliament is committed, and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats is also very seriously committed to securing an agreement as soon as possible, and to making sure that this is a good agreement, in other words, one that takes into account the interests of European citizens, including their data protection interests."
"We know and we feel the responsibility, since this is a very important element in combating terrorism, even if it is not the only or even the most important element, but this particular data exchange is very important."
"It seems to us that the mandate in its present state provides solutions to many problems but leaves many others without a solution."
"As yet, there is no solution to problems such as those mentioned earlier by our colleagues and which will be the subject of further discussion today."
"I think that these two weeks, which are available to us because of the postponement of the vote due to the problems with flying, present us with an opportunity; an opportunity to find solutions to the outstanding problems and to find answers to those questions and reservations raised by Parliament to which we have not yet found reassuring answers."
"It would be good if Council did not reach a decision before Parliament has had a chance to vote, since that could cause further difficulties in the near future."
"Mr President, clearly, the Commission has listened."
"The draft mandate is indeed a clear improvement on previous agreements, though my colleagues have highlighted aspects where our concerns remain."
"I will not repeat those concerns apart from thanking my colleague, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, for all her hard work for the Parliament."
"I want to say something on process and something on context."
"Recent progress is, I think, a tribute to what can be achieved when partners treat each other with respect and listen to each other, treat objections seriously and try hard to bring views together."
"As well as the Commission, I actually believe that the US authorities have made that effort of engagement and understanding."
"I would like to thank Ambassador Bill Kennard in that regard."
"He has grasped very well how the European Parliament works, perhaps rather better than some of our Member States."
"Now what we need is for the Council to make the same effort and adopt a progressive mandate."
"It was the Council's failure last time to come to us with a serious offer of improvement meeting MEPs' concerns that made it necessary for us to strike down the interim agreement."
"For the last decade - and this is the point on context - authorities in the US and the EU have progressed in a reactive, even knee-jerk, manner to real or perceived security threats."
"Sometimes, governments have even been guilty of gesture or dog-whistle politics designed to get media headlines or to label opponents soft on crime or terrorism."
"We cannot go on like this, and I look forward to a new start where we base decisions, especially about data storage and transfer, on our basic bedrock principles of proportionality, necessity and legal processing."
"We need an audit of all the schemes and projects that have accumulated in an unplanned manner."
"I am heartened that - as I understand it - Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m plans to do that so we can get a clear view of gaps, duplication and over-intrusive measures and arrive at a rational and effective security framework that does not junk our civil liberties."
"(NL) Mr President, resolution or no resolution, I believe that the Council heard us loud and clear last time and knows full well what it has to do."
"This Parliament is concerned about fundamental rights and the protection of citizens' privacy and also about data protection."
"These are fundamental rights, and a simple cost-benefit analysis is inappropriate where these are concerned."
"The grounds given for requesting data in bulk - that it is technically impossible to do things any more precisely - strikes me as a strange argument."
"I do not believe for a minute that this is technically impossible; as I see it, it is more a matter of money and of cost."
"As I said, where fundamental rights are concerned, it is not simply a matter of how much something costs."
"In addition, it is important that Europe now shows itself to be an equal negotiating partner, as opposed to one that simply cosies up or waits for the United States to lay down the rules."
"Parliament has given the Council and the Commission the power and elbow room to approach this role seriously from now on, and in this regard, I would ask the Commission and the Council to take account of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms that is now in force."
"This, too, will have to be included in your mandate and the result of your negotiations."
"I hope you come back with the right results, I hope you use the power and authority we gave you last time, and I await what you have to show for yourselves on your return."
"(PL) Mr President, the United States is the only world superpower today."
"It is an absolute and multidimensional superpower - cultural, military and economic. We are fortunate that this superpower is friendly to us and is based on the same values and foundations upon which the European Union is built."
"Therefore, we should appreciate this and support the United States in the noble cause of the fight against terrorism, because Western Europe in particular was protected by the US from communism for many decades."
"It was only thanks to the US that free Europe was free for 40 years."
"Today, the United States is giving very strong support to the whole free world so that the world can be free from terrorism."
"A comparison between the United States and the European Union of the efforts, financial outlays and technology devoted to the fight against terrorism is embarrassing for European states and the European Union."
"Therefore, if we can do something to help the United States in the fight against terrorism - and this is how I see this agreement - we should not hesitate."
"We should, of course, respect the principles of which we have been talking, but that, as I see it, is a question of cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"What is required of us today is an expression of the political will to enter into such an agreement."
"I think such political will should be present here."
"The United States should enter into a treaty agreement with the European Union which will be both friendly and based on partnership."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the progress that has nonetheless been made since February, when Parliament did what was only right - in other words, rejected the SWIFT agreement."
"Parliament now has greater opportunity to make demands as regards the content of the agreement."
"An intelligent Commission and an intelligent Council would be wise to pay heed to the demands and objections made by Parliament in February."
"They concern our freedoms and civil rights, and that is the basis of the rule of law."
"That is why we cannot allow the mass transmission of data without restrictions."
"Such an agreement mixes together innocent citizens with those who may be guilty."
"We can only allow data to be passed on where there are strong reasons to suspect the person concerned of being involved in crime."
"It is claimed that there are technical problems inherent in this."
"If that is the case, then we must ask ourselves whether our legislation should be decided by the technology or by our fundamental freedoms and civil rights."
"To me the answer is obvious: our legislation must be based on our rights."
"(SK) In February, we refused to ratify an agreement on processing and transmitting data contained in financial reports for the purposes of a US Treasury programme to monitor terrorism."
"The reasons for the refusal were clearly listed and they include in particular:"
"breaching the fundamental principles of data protection law for a large number of citizens and subjects of the European Union (up to 90 million data items per month),"
"the absence of protection for EU citizens against the abuse of their data provided under this agreement to the United States and to third countries, and"
"the absence of genuine reciprocity, since the other party to the agreement has not undertaken to provide information of similar quality and scope to the EU."
"Many of these shortcomings can be eliminated in the new agreement, but the actual principle of a comprehensive transfer of all data from the EU to the US, where the US processes, evaluates and stores all records on EU financial operations without any restriction, under the pretext of looking for links to terrorism, is not tenable."
"This tenet must be amended."
"The financial operations of European banks should be processed only under European rules and on European soil."
"We will hand over to our friends from the United States only those items that really relate to terrorism."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this House, I supported the agreement concluded between the European Union and the United States on mutual judicial assistance."
"I did so because I consider transatlantic cooperation to be very important in general, and particularly so in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In the plenary session on 11 February, I voted against the provisional agreement on the transfer of financial data concluded between the European Union and the United States."
"I did so for the sake of Parliament's prerogatives, but also because the agreement was unacceptable."
"In that debate, I called for respect for the principles of necessity and proportionality, as well as for the integrity and security of European financial data."
"I am pleased to note at this juncture the Commission's and the Council's new attitude towards cooperating with Parliament."
"I believe that together, we shall succeed in establishing the basic principles that should guide and facilitate future cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism."
"I hope that the concerns expressed by Parliament in its resolution of September 2009 will be duly taken into account in this new agreement."
"I reiterate that there needs to be absolute respect for the principles of necessity, proportionality and reciprocity."
"I emphasise that there must be basic safeguards to guarantee that such data are retained for as little time as is strictly essential, after which they should be destroyed."
"I reiterate the demand that legal appeals must be possible and that suitable guarantees must be established regarding any transfer of personal details to third countries."
"Above all, it must be proved that such data are useful in preventing acts of terrorism or incriminating terrorists."
"Outside this framework, it will not be possible to obtain our consent."
"The European Parliament will be consistent with the positions it has always held."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, the draft mandate proposed by the European Commission is a step in the right direction."
"The fight against terrorism is our priority."
"It is therefore important to put a new agreement in place as soon as possible on the exchange of financial data with the United States, but not at all costs."
"In February, a large majority of us said 'no' to a bad interim agreement with the United States; 'no' to the exclusion of the European Parliament, the body representing 500 million citizens."
"Citizens do not want their bank details to be simply transferred to the United States without sound guarantees of their rights."
"We want an agreement with sound guarantees to protect the rights of our European citizens."
"If these are not offered under the present negotiating mandate, there will be little difference from the state of affairs in February."
"We need very good reasons if we are to say 'yes' this time."
"The Council and the Commission must inform the European Parliament comprehensively and directly."
"It is to be welcomed that account has been taken of Parliament's objections concerning guarantees of fundamental rights and freedoms in relation to the protection of personal data."
"These will have to be the criterion for determining whether or not data are transferred, along with the criterion that the data must relate to the fight against terrorism."
"These are fine promises, but I am curious as to how the Council and the Commission will safeguard these guarantees in practice."
"The principles of proportionality and effectiveness are paramount."
"Also, will the United States really do the same for us?"
"What I would welcome is a complete, detailed statement of the rights our citizens would enjoy under the prospective agreement."
"The Council and the Commission are proposing to entrust a European body with examining requests from the United States."
"Council and Commission, what form do you see this kind of public EU body taking?"
"Will it be a judicial authority, and will citizens have the possibility of court proceedings, which they are guaranteed in Europe?"
"I should like to hear your responses."
"(DE) Mr President, thank you, Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m."
"The negotiating mandate before us shows, above all, that the Commission and Parliament are again taking the same line and that cooperation has at least got off to a good start."
"The fact that the European Parliament rejected the agreement in February - and I address this to all those who have described it as muscle flexing - has nothing to do with muscle flexing; it is about assuming responsibility."
"Assuming responsibility for the rights of those that we represent, namely the citizens of Europe."
"The negotiations on the new agreement on the transfer of bank data now under way will, above all, answer the crucial question as to where Parliament and the European Union stand on respect."
"Respect among partners, respect for citizens and respect for European legislation."
"We were able to slip a lot of things that are important to us into this negotiating mandate."
"The resolution that we will adopt in May very much reflects those things that specifically concern the protection of our citizens, both their data and their judicial remedies, including extraterritorial protection, particularly when their rights could be violated extraterritorially."
"We have talked a lot about the transfer of aggregated data, so-called bulk data transfers."
"What we must clarify is the fact that in the mandate concluded, we must set out how and when this problem will be resolved."
"Otherwise, it will be very difficult to represent the whole thing in light of what we have formulated so far."
"The European Parliament's resolution highlights this in two paragraphs, the negotiating mandate in one."
"I am confident that the Commission will resolve this in a sensible manner."
"(PL) Our debate is taking place literally two days before a meeting of ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union on the same subject."
"Therefore, and let us say it directly, our position is potentially a form of political pressure."
"We are discussing this problem at a time when the fate of the negotiating mandate in talks with the United States is in the balance."
"We have barely two months and one week to begin negotiations with Washington."
"The European Commission is not very flexible in this area."
"It has not proposed - with the greatest respect for Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m - a single similar but alternative position."
"However, playing on the basis of 'all or nothing' is not only irrelevant and not in accord with the spirit of the European Union, but it is also a road to nowhere, a blind alley."
"I am in favour of close cooperation with the USA and exchange of data, but the devil is in the detail."
"While I am not an enthusiast of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I would, however, like to ask if it is true that this mandate does not respect the provisions of the Charter."
"What shall we do when the passenger data which we transfer to the USA, and I am in favour of this, are used for unauthorised purposes?"
"Mr President, it is shocking to me that this Commission is still insisting on passing sensitive financial information on millions of innocent European citizens, including those from the UK, despite Parliament and the Civil Liberties Committee rejecting the proposals."
"The issue here is not how we can better manage SWIFT, but that there should be no SWIFT agreement at all."
"I would totally oppose this sort of infringement by my own government and resolutely stand against the EU handing in constituents' personal information to America."
"Handing over such information is at the thin end of the wedge, leading us into a frightening Big Brother of Europe."
"Under current rules, the US can retain data for 90 years, which is longer than an average lifetime, and, although the US authorities say untouched data is deleted after five years, the US Government has already been accused of giving data to big American companies, not to tackle terrorism, but rather to further economic interests."
"The European Parliament threw out these sickening proposals but the Commission does not like backing down, and an interim agreement was signed without parliamentary approval by the European Council last year, the day before the Lisbon Treaty would have prohibited it under the codecision procedure."
"On 11 February, the European Parliament again rejected the interim agreement and a week prior to that, Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee rejected the deal."
"Your dogged pursuit of this disgusting agreement just goes to show your contempt for democracy and liberties of the people, including those from my country, Wales, and the rest of the United Kingdom."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I would expressly like to thank both Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m and Commissioner Reding for their intensive efforts to take up the issues that have been raised by Parliament, as well as the problems that we see and have seen in the area of data security and confidentiality, in order to negotiate with the United States."
"I am also grateful that key issues - as mentioned by my fellow Members - have already been analysed or considered in the mandate and that, in particular, this also includes issues in the area of inspection as well as the area of reciprocity."
"On the matter of the erasure of data, I also consider it very important to be able to renegotiate the five-year period, since it is really not acceptable to hold data for such a long time."
"I also feel it is important to ultimately discuss the matter of penalties in cases of deliberate extraction to the wrong ends in sensitive circumstances, since that prevents certain things being extracted that we do not want to see extracted."
"The focus should only be on terrorism."
"To me, what is also important is the idea that we have to tackle our own TFTP and that in the longer term, we cannot transfer bulk data, that is to say, large amounts of data to the United States."
"That has nothing to do with mistrust, but the fact that in the long term, we ultimately want to take our own responsibility within Europe on an equal footing, and then exchange specific extracted data for the sole purpose of combating terrorism and finally maintain real reciprocity."
"In this context, I would again like to ask the Commission to indicate how the topic of our own TFTP is viewed within the Commission and in the joint discussion with the Council."
"(SL) Terrorism remains one of the main threats to security in the European Union and we need to start negotiations with the US on the transfer of banking data as soon as possible, but not at any cost."
"A new agreement must provide greater protection of the personal data of European citizens."
"We need a better agreement, one which takes into account human rights and which addresses the issue of transferring batches of data on millions of European citizens."
"The future agreement must also be a reciprocal one, which means that US authorities should provide similar data on financial transactions if the European Union establishes its financial transactions tracking programme in the future."
"I am pleased to hear that the Commission agrees with this."
"The new agreement must also ensure stricter guarantees for the transfer of data to third countries."
"Are we going to allow the US to transfer information to any country or are we going to set out some clear criteria for that?"
"It is imperative that we have the most appropriate safeguards."
"It would also be appropriate for the country providing data to consent to their transfer to third countries, so that we can set up a system requiring countries that provide data to give their consent."
"I therefore wonder if we could put in place some instruments that would also allow us to refuse the transfer of information to third countries where they fail to provide sufficiently specific reasons for obtaining such data."
"As the European Union does not have its own financial transactions tracking system, our security depends on the US."
"However, what can we ask for in return?"
"We must also ensure that the future agreement with the US can be terminated immediately if any of the commitments is not met."
"We need to persuade our citizens that transferring banking data is a sensible thing to do, since we are more and more concerned about the extent to which we permit intrusion into our privacy in the fight against terrorism."
"(SV) Mr President, ever since the end of the Second World War, it has been important to us Liberals to emphasise the transatlantic links between the US and Europe and to highlight our cooperation in various areas."
"However, as in all partnerships, complications and difficulties can arise, and we have to overcome these."
"One of the trickier complications has been the issue of people's legitimate right to personal privacy."
"I believe that as time goes on, it will become very clear that Parliament did the right thing in rejecting the temporary SWIFT agreement."
"The EU must be characterised by democracy and transparency; we, the elected representatives in this House, are an important part of this."
"The procedures surrounding SWIFT left a great deal to be desired in this respect."
"Parliament has stated quite clearly what we demand in order to approve a new permanent agreement."
"The criteria are listed in the resolution that we are dealing with and debating today, and once these requirements are met, I look forward to a new vote."
"There remains a conflict of interests between security on the one hand and the right to privacy on the other."
"Let us now put the past behind us and work confidently towards our central aim, of which a new permanent SWIFT agreement is an important part: namely the security, protection and privacy of the citizens of Europe."
"(FR) We will all agree - there can be no ambiguity on this issue - that the fight against terrorism is a shared fight in which the European Union must play a full part."
"Yet it is just as crucial for us MEPs to ensure that the rights of European citizens and, in particular, the right to protection of personal data, are respected."
"I feel it is necessary to stress this point, and this message is addressed not only to the representatives of the Council and the Commission present in this House, but also to the US authorities, with which a new agreement must be negotiated."
"More specifically, I wish to highlight one point that features among the essential demands made by the European Parliament, namely, the issue of data being retained by the US authorities."
"The current plans are disproportionate in my view. That is why several questions need to be asked."
"Why retain for such a long time - five years - data which, according to the parties involved, are not used?"
"Is it not possible to reduce their retention period to a more reasonable length of time?"
"As regards the data selected, this time, no retention period is mentioned in the mandate."
"The previous agreement stipulated a maximum period of 90 years."
"Would it not be a good idea to decide on an appropriate retention period that is proportionate to the use made of these data, for example, in relation to the length of a specific investigation, or of a specific trial?"
"Is there an intended use for these data other than that of combating terrorism, and what is it?"
"Lastly, could we consider retaining these data in Europe rather than in the United States?"
"I should like the Council and the Commission to answer these questions."
"This point is, in fact, crucial, and the European Parliament will not beat about the bush on this issue."
"Therefore, it is vitally important for the Council to take specific account of this when it adopts the Commission's negotiating mandate."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament took a very important step two months ago when it rejected this interim agreement."
"Without going back over this matter, since I am the 27th speaker this afternoon, I should just like to stress that some people very poetically described this phase of European democracy as the first day in the life of the European Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Indeed, not only was it an historic victory in terms of respect for the privacy and the freedoms of the citizens of Europe and beyond, but it was also a turning point for the powers of the European Parliament and, at the same time, a great moment of courage and daring on the part of our rapporteur, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, to whom I should like to pay tribute in particular for her determination only a few weeks away from an important date for her."
"There is no point in mentioning the underlying elements that make us interdependent where counterterrorism, security, and the balance to be struck in the area of individual freedoms are concerned."
"Thus, as part of this new negotiating mandate, we are going to have to reach a fair and balanced agreement that respects rights and that is surrounded by guarantees illustrating what ultimately represents, in my eyes and in the eyes of many of our fellow citizens, the substance and strength of the European Union, namely the protection of European citizens."
"Since our political will must comply with the law and with expression through legal channels, I shall not go back over the elements of reciprocity and proportionality."
"Nevertheless, I do hope that stricter legal rules are enforced on bulk data transfers in a very vigilant and demanding way, as an issue separate from the storage and the right to rectification, modification and deletion of data, and from the right to appeal before the courts."
"It is up to us to cooperate in order, together, to strike this balance between the demands of security and those of freedoms."
"(RO) The European Union acknowledges the particular importance of exchanging information globally in the fight against terrorism."
"MEPs in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament support any action which may result in preventing and halting terrorism."
"MEPs have been elected democratically to represent the interests of European citizens and cannot compromise in any way on the fact that they need to protect their rights enshrined in treaties and conventions."
"There are some subjects which we cannot ignore, such as personal data protection, legal protection, data transfer volume, proportionality, reciprocity or the European Parliament's permanent involvement in the monitoring process."
"I believe that the appointment of a European authority for processing, authorising and transferring SWIFT data would be a solution which would provide the European Union with the guarantee that this data will be used solely for the purpose of fighting terrorism and that it pertains only to suspects who have already been identified."
"European citizens will also have somewhere to submit complaints about any abuses."
"We ask the Commission to submit, at least annually, reports on the implementation of the agreement in question."
"I believe that this will guarantee that the process is being conducted according to the approved agreement and that we will be able to eliminate any shortcomings in good time."
"With the aim of reaching a better mutual understanding of the points where there is a difference of opinion, I suggest that briefing sessions should be arranged immediately for the European Parliament's political groups or even for national delegations, along with US representatives accredited to the European Union or Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, the trial of strength that our Parliament has embarked on with the Commission and the Council on the draft SWIFT agreement may be a good thing, provided that the collection and transfer of data relating to banking transactions are used exclusively for counterterrorism purposes."
"Just about everyone has mentioned this obvious fact by now, but experience shows that, when it comes to the use of personal data, nothing is less certain."
"A suspected terrorist who is known to the United States' intelligence services is not necessarily known to their European counterparts, as the Commission's answer to one of my questions shows."
"My standpoint on any new agreement on this matter will depend on the relevance of gathering personal data, on the provision of those data to security control bodies and on respect for the principle of reciprocity as regards information held by the authorities."
"I feel it is wise, therefore, to think about the best way of enforcing these conditions."
"It is up to Parliament to make this one of its prerogatives."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate in advance of the Council's formal consideration of the Commission's proposed mandate."
"I also welcome the acceptance by the Commission of many of the concerns expressed by this Parliament when we rejected the interim agreement as inadequate."
"Regretfully, due to circumstances beyond our control here today, we cannot adopt a Parliament position on the draft mandate."
"We will vote on 6 May, and I strongly urge the Council not to sign off on an agreement before that date."
"This Parliament's consent is a treaty requirement, as indeed is compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights in any agreement that the Council signs off on."
"It is extremely important to bear in mind that a short delay will be far less damaging to EU-US relations than a second rejection of a draft agreement."
"I, like many others, have continuing concerns about block data transfer and indeed the control of that data once it leaves our control."
"I am not satisfied so far that what is being proposed is, in fact, going to address those concerns."
"I do want closer cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America, but that cooperation must be based on mutual respect for citizens' rights."
"(RO) As you are well aware and has also been stated today, the fight against terrorism is a common cause in Europe."
"Anti-Americanism is not a common cause in Europe."
"This is why, especially based on what one of my fellow Members was saying before me, I do not believe that a statement which has blatantly expressed anti-American sentiment could be considered as a source of inspiration for establishing our Parliament The reason for this is that, in general, I think that feelings against the United States must not block agreement on fighting terrorism."
"In fact, I would like to talk about trust in the relationship with the United States."
"We in the European Union and United States have common enemies who will not hesitate to exploit any crack and any evidence of a lack of trust in this relationship."
"The data provided by SWIFT cannot be used for any purpose other than fighting against terrorism."
"The exception to this, of course, is situations where other extremely serious activities are associated with terrorism, such as drug trafficking and espionage."
"Let us trust our US partners."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe there are a few things that are beyond dispute, like the transatlantic partnership - since it really is the foundation of our foreign policy - the common fight against terrorism and also the cooperation of the EU institutions."
"However, the fact also remains that with the Treaty of Lisbon, we have acquired new foundations and, as the European Parliament, we have new rights and these rights must, above all, be exercised to protect our citizens."
"One right is the protection of the fundamental rights of our citizens, as well as the protection of life and the protection of privacy."
"Therefore we are in favour of the transfer of specific data."
"However, the transfer of aggregate data is certainly going overboard."
"The new agreement should give assurances of a balance between these fundamental rights, but also of reciprocity, proportionality and a minimum level of data security."
"I would also like to ask the representative of the Council, the Presidency, where they were this morning when we debated the 2008 budget discharge - one of the most important chapters."
"Unfortunately, the Council Presidency was conspicuous by its absence."
"Mr President, one of the crucially important questions is whether bulk data - that is everyone's information - should be handed over or whether data should be confined to identified individuals."
"There is, of course, an intermediate position."
"Population groups associated with terrorism at a particular time could be targeted."
"For example, if Orkney fishermen suddenly became radicalised and started to kill humankind and not just fish, then they should be targeted."
"If ageing, overweight, grey retired college teachers should put on fatigues and commit terrorist outrages against their students, rather than just boring them to death with their deadly monotones, then they - or rather I should say we - should also be targeted."
"Targeting is viewed with distaste and condemned as discriminatory."
"I would call it common sense."
"Nevertheless, there must be early destruction of data belonging to innocent members of those targeted groups."
"(CS) Mr President, detecting the financial flows of terrorist networks is a highly effective instrument in the fight against terrorism."
"In February, the left rejected a provisional agreement without even proposing another suitable framework for security units, thereby complicating the work of the police and the judiciary."
"We must now join forces in order to adopt a new, definitive agreement."
"I applaud the fact that the Council and Commission are today communicating openly, and I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether it is necessary to transmit 90 million items of data every month, because I have my doubts about that, and I would also like to ask how our citizens will appeal to the American authorities over suspected abuses of data and who will monitor the data transmitted to the American Government."
"In my opinion, it should perhaps be an independent judicial body based on international treaties on mutual legal assistance, and not Europol, the decisions of which cannot be reviewed and which will not even have suitable powers unless we amend its statute."
"The priority is the fight against terrorism, but we cannot circumvent the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is supposed to guarantee the protection of personal data."
"Open access to judicial review in contentious cases would, in my view, be a sure guarantee."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate shows that civil rights and the fight against terrorism are not always easy to reconcile."
"The SWIFT agreement that is being discussed again today underlines the problem of protecting our civil rights while, at the same time, investing in the security of our world community."
"The Commission's draft mandate continues to provide for the transfer of large data units between the USA and the EU. The retention periods are still too long and, last but not least, I have two questions."
"Is there a time limit to this bilateral agreement?"
"If so, what is the timeframe and within what timeframe will the data finally be erased?"
"(FI) Mr President, the fight against terrorism is important, and the EU must be part of this."
"We cannot do this by trampling on human rights, however."
"Respect for human rights is one of the most important European values, and it should be a unifying factor in transatlantic cooperation too."
"It is important that transatlantic cooperation should work, but it must work reciprocally and with a feeling of mutual respect."
"Changes to data must take place individually, and I want to stress again that we cannot trample on human rights in the name of the fight with terrorism."
"If this happens, then we will have helped the terrorists."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, I wish to congratulate the authors of the motion for a resolution on the conclusion of the agreement between the United States and the European Union on the transfer of financial data to combat terrorism."
"This resolution reiterates, in a balanced way, not only the requirements in terms of security but also the guarantees that the data of European citizens will be protected and that their fundamental rights will be respected."
"As such, I believe that appointing a European public judicial authority to be in charge of receiving the requests issued by the United States Treasury Department is the key to the balanced approach we are looking for."
"Indeed, it will help overcome the many obstacles to the principles of necessity and proportionality that have emerged, in particular, in the case of bulk data transfers."
"It would also pave the way for the introduction of genuine reciprocity; in other words, it would be possible for the European authorities and the Member States' competent authorities to obtain financial data stored on US territory."
"It is our credibility that is at stake here."
"The SWIFT agreement is a kind of democratic test that we are all duty-bound to pass for the good of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying to Mr Seeber that I was in fact present this morning at the debate to which he was referring."
"Even though I had not been officially invited, you, ladies and gentlemen, asked me to come and I came: I was present and spoke in that debate."
"Perhaps it was he who was not here, just as he is not in this session now and has left the Chamber."
"Well, I wanted to say that the debate we have had was, in my view, highly constructive."
"I believe it shows that there is a real spirit of cooperation on both sides, among all the parties involved: Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, acknowledged the spirit of cooperation she could see in the Council - for which I am very grateful - and also in the Commission."
"I am grateful that she has said so publicly."
"Indeed, there is no doubt whatever that both the mandate that the Commission has put forward through Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and the mandate that the Council will approve will very much take account of and find inspiration in the concerns and positions expressed in your speeches and in the motion or draft motion for a resolution proposed by the rapporteur."
"I have noticed that there is a series of problems that concern you in particular, and I want to assure you that those problems and concerns that you have mentioned will form part of the negotiating directives that the Council is going to approve."
"The negotiations will be directed by the Commission and will result in something that the Council and Parliament will have to sign."
"The first item in those negotiating directives will be the problem that has been brought up repeatedly here this afternoon: bulk data transfer."
"Mr Albrecht, Mr Busuttil, Mrs Sippel, Mrs Sargentini, Mrs Svensson, Mr PaÅ¡ka, Mr De Rossa and several others have raised this issue."
"I would like to tell you that we cannot, of course, accept indiscriminate bulk transfer, whatever may be requested for any purpose."
"It is not about that."
"It is about data that is requested solely for preventing, investigating and prosecuting terrorist crimes and terrorist financing and, moreover, with individualised objectives regarding a particular person where there are grounds for thinking that that person has a nexus or relations with terrorism or its financing."
"We are therefore not looking at mass transfer of such data; the objective and the subject place very clear bounds on that transfer of data."
"In addition, there will be a European authority through which that data will be requested, and afterwards there will also be a check, essentially carried out by the Commission, on the use of said data and on the operation of the agreement that is to be signed."
"I therefore believe that there is a mechanism in place that is perfectly able to answer the concerns that have been raised here on this issue."
"The retention period for data has also been mentioned."
"The retention period for data is set at around five years, because it is obviously necessary to retain the data for a minimum period of time for reasons of effectiveness."
"It must be made clear, though, that the period must be as short as possible and no longer than is necessary to achieve the objective."
"The objective - the need to retain the data - must always be absolutely well defined; otherwise it would not make sense."
"Data must always be retained with an objective and in relation to a specific person."
"You have also shown your concern regarding people's rights to have access to, to be informed about and to correct their data."
"Mr Coelho, for example, who is not here at the moment, expressed this in some detail."
"I can tell you that the negotiating directives agree with the draft mandate drawn up by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m in that those rights will be assured."
"The rights of information, access and correction will and must be assured in the agreement to be signed."
"The principles of necessity and of proportionality will be assured in the negotiating directives and in the agreement that is eventually signed."
"The possibility of appeal will be assured - administrative appeal and judicial appeal - without discrimination on the basis of nationality or for any other reason."
"Therefore, in relation to the concerns raised by Members, including Mrs Bozkurt and Mrs Vergiat, all that will be assured."
"In addition, there will be absolute reciprocity."
"This is one of the topics that was most emphasised in the previous debate, which we all remember."
"There will be absolute reciprocity with regard to the United States."
"That is another of the characteristics of the negotiating directives that the Council will approve and which agree with what you have said here and with the motion for a resolution proposed by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert."
"I would like to point out here that the Council is firmly committed to approving a mandate that protects the fundamental rights of European citizens, and which applies and is absolutely faithful to and in accordance with the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights - which forms part of the Treaty of Lisbon - and the European Convention on Human Rights, which the EU proposes to sign in the coming months as one of the goals marking the beginning of this new political stage of the Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think this has indeed been a very constructive debate."
"We have listened carefully and are taking due notice of everything that has been said."
"The Council answered quite a lot of the questions that were raised, and I will just add a few things because it is important that we get as much clarity as possible."
"There will be an EU review team. They will have the right to review random samples to ensure that the data has been taken in a way that is respected according to the agreement."
"There must be a reasonable belief that the target of the search is a terrorist or someone financing terrorism."
"We also must remember that each and every search of TFTP data is verified by a SWIFT scrutineer and by an independent judicial authority before it is given out."
"The EU review team will also have access to this information."
"The agreement will ensure that EU citizens have access to non-discriminatory administrative and judicial rights."
"Exactly how this will be specified is, of course, part of the negotiations, so I cannot be more specific on this."
"But it is - as the Council also said - a very important part of the negotiation."
"We will have to find a solution to this, and as regards rectification and access."
"Data will not be transferred to third countries - only relevant leads analysis but not mass data - and it will only be for terrorism purposes."
"The whole deal is only for terrorism purposes."
"The agreement will also ensure that EU nationals, via their data protection authorities, have the right to know that the rights of the data subject have been duly respected."
"The use requests for data are already targeted when it comes to bulk data."
"There has to be a suspected terrorist that can only be searched."
"So only a fraction of SWIFT data will be transferred and only a very small proportion of that will be accessed."
"The rest will remain anonymous."
"We will seek to reduce and explore the possibility of reducing and fine-tuning the definition in order to have the volume still further reduced, but there are already legally binding rules that would prevent any access to that data unless there is reasonable suspicion."
"The EU review team will verify a representative sample - as I said - and if there are any breaches of the agreement, it can be immediately interrupted by the European Union."
"So I think that we can act swiftly and that we can have a good agreement."
"There is the security gap issue that we have to take into consideration but, of course, there are also many questions that have to be answered concerning data protection and the other issues that you have raised."
"The Americans have shown a very open attitude so far."
"They are ready to work with us as quickly as possible but also to be creative and to find answers to our questions."
"I know that a team from the European Parliament will travel next week and you will be able to put questions and hopefully have more answers then."
"The other track in parallel to this is, of course, whether we should have another solution at European level, whether we should have an EU TFTP or create some new authority."
"That is a very important discussion. It needs to be explored in depth within Europe."
"Of course, that will not be part of the negotiation."
"We must make sure that, should this happen, the Americans will help and there will be reciprocity, but we must figure that out."
"The Commission is willing to participate, to be innovative and to put forward proposals, but that is for the Member States to decide."
"I know that the European Parliament is very active, and I am looking forward to having these discussions with you."
"So this is a parallel discussion."
"Also in parallel, there is the work done by my colleague, Vice-President Viviane Reding, who is already starting to draft a mandate for a long-term data protection agreement for all the agreements that we have with the United States."
"Of course, this is also something that has to be put into the picture."
"Finally, the volcano in Iceland is, of course, something that has created a lot of travel problems for many people all around the world and it makes it impossible for you to vote."
"I very much deplore that, but you can be sure that - the Presidency is here, I am here, our services are here - we have taken due account of the debate."
"We have seen the draft resolution and that is signed by four political groups. We will communicate that to the Ministers."
"If we postpone the decision in the Council, we will lose two important weeks of negotiations."
"I said earlier that the Americans are willing."
"They are constructive and they want to embark on this, but it will not be easy."
"It will be a difficult negotiation and we need the time."
"We want to get this done as soon as possible but also as well as possible."
"If we want the European Parliament to be able to vote on it before the summer recess, we must take a decision so that we can start the negotiations as soon as possible."
"So please be understanding about this."
"I do want to reassure you that both the Presidency and the Commission have listened extremely carefully to your views and, as the Presidency said, we will take account of the debate here and communicate it to the Ministers on Friday."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in May."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I welcome the new SWIFT mandate for the EU-US agreement as part of the terrorist financing tracking programme, especially as the Council and Commission have learnt the lesson from the past and included Parliament's stringent demand in negotiations, which is that higher standards should be applied to data protection."
"However, this transfer of financial messaging data from the EU to the US must be firmly negotiated with the US authorities."
"No bulk data must be transferred and technical resources must be insisted on which can facilitate the transfer of individual data, pertaining to suspects only."
"I hope that this agreement will not cause the EU any surprises in the future and that it will be clarified before signing the agreement that the EU is entitled to obtain information from the US database and that there is no possibility of data being transferred to third countries."
"Furthermore, this transfer must guarantee the protection and entitlement of citizens, especially with regard to accessing and amending their data, as stipulated in national and European legislation."
"Last but not least, it must be clarified that European citizens have the right to submit a complaint where their personal data is used illegally."
"Passenger Name Record (PNR) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Passenger Name Record (PNR)."
"Madam President, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the Council Presidency submitted to Parliament two agreements on the use of passenger name record data, known as 'PNR agreements', one dating from 2007 with the United States and the other from 2008 with Australia."
"We have asked Parliament to give its approval to both agreements so that they can enter into force permanently, as at the moment, they are being applied merely provisionally."
"According to the Treaty of Lisbon, it is for Parliament to decide whether or not to approve these agreements, which determine the conditions under which PNR data on passengers on aircraft flying from the European Union can be shared with third countries."
"The Council understands Parliament's concerns - in line with what we have just been debating - specifically on the collection and sharing of that personal data which has to do with the fact that a person is included on a flight passenger list to fly outside the EU."
"The Council has therefore asked the Commission to put forward a general guideline document in this respect."
"I must say that the motion for a resolution that we have seen appears to be highly appropriate and, moreover, we welcome the constructive attitude not to vote on the agreements for the time being and the fact that the motion for a resolution calls for a suitable mechanism for reviewing the agreements."
"In the case of the United States, it is true that there already exists a report reviewing the way the agreement works, and the Council will state its position once the Commission has proposed and submitted its recommendations for a new agreement with the United States."
"In the case of the agreement with Australia, there has not yet been a review of how well it is working."
"It will be for the Commission to decide whether it will wait for such a review of the agreement before it sets out a new negotiating mandate."
"When the Commission proposes new mandates for negotiations with the United States and Australia, the Council will examine them carefully."
"In that respect, it will, of course, take account of Parliament's wishes, as always."
"With regard to the Council's request to the Commission for a broader, more generic regulation on the use of PNR data, we should remember that back in 2007, the Commission proposed a framework decision."
"During the Swedish Presidency, however, the decision was made not to pursue the debates on that framework decision, since the Swedish Presidency justifiably thought that, as the Treaty of Lisbon was about to enter into force, the topic was going to be a matter for codecision with Parliament and therefore the debate had to involve Parliament."
"Consequently, the Presidency cannot, at the moment, adopt a position on the content of a future general scheme for the data of passengers who are on a list to travel outside the European Union until the Commission proposes a directive on the use of such data and there is a debate with this Parliament under the codecision procedure, which is the procedure we have had since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December last year."
"In any case, in this respect, our ideas are, to a great extent, in line and in agreement with the criteria and positions that can be deduced from Parliament's motion for a resolution, which is just a motion for the time being."
"I would like to highlight three items in it."
"First, the data may only be used for the purpose for which it was obtained, which is similar to what we said before with regard to the SWIFT agreement; secondly, the collection of such data must be in line with our data protection legislation; and, moreover, there must be a series of guarantees and safeguards covering the transfer of such data to third countries."
"These, I believe, are three important principles."
"They are in the motion for a resolution and, in that respect, we agree with the motion."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the importance of collecting PNR data is acknowledged by a growing number of countries in the world, including EU Member States."
"They use such data to combat terrorism and other serious crimes."
"To ensure that basic principles of data protection are respected and that PNR data is only used for specific law enforcement purposes, the EU has signed agreements with a number of countries on the transfer and the use of PNR data."
"Two of these agreements, with the US and Australia, are before you for consent to conclude them."
"With your resolution, you propose to postpone the vote on the consent and you call upon the Commission to propose a series of requirements for all PNR agreements with third countries."
"You also call upon the Commission to renegotiate these two agreements on the basis of new negotiating directives which should meet those requirements."
"I think that is a wise strategy."
"In your resolution, you also refer to the PNR agreement with Canada."
"That agreement was linked to a set of Canadian commitments and a Commission adequacy decision."
"These documents expired on 22 September last year and a new agreement should therefore be renegotiated with Canada."
"For practical reasons, it was not possible to do this before September 2009."
"However, this does not diminish the level of protection of PNR data transferred to Canada."
"The PNR agreement itself does not have an expiry date; it has never been terminated and thus continues to be in force."
"The Canada Border Services Agency has confirmed in a letter to the Commission, to the Council Presidency and the Member States that its commitments will remain in full effect until a new agreement is in force."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur Ms Sophia in 't Veld and the other political groups for their constructive approach on these files, under which the agreements with the US and Australia remain provisionally applicable until their renegotiation."
"I will, in the meantime, propose a set of three recommendations for negotiation directives to the Council as a part of a PNR package."
"The package will consist firstly of a communication on a global external PNR strategy, including a set of general requirements that any PNR agreement with a third country should observe; secondly, two negotiating directives for the renegotiation of the US and Australia PNR agreements, and negotiating directives for a new agreement with Canada; and, thirdly, a new Commission EU PNR proposal based on an impact assessment."
"This package will take due care of your recommendations as presented in this resolution, but also in the resolutions of November 2008."
"Moreover, it will take due account of the advice of the European Data Protection Supervisor, the Article 29 Working Party on Data Protection and the national data protection authorities."
"I believe it is important to present an EU PNR system at the same time as the measures to ensure coherence and consistency between the EU's internal and external PNR policies."
"In conclusion, I welcome this resolution and I will act according to these recommendations."
"I am looking forward to working further with you on these issues."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, with the analysis of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, as with SWIFT, an attempt is being made to reconcile the fight against global terrorism and serious crime with the fundamental rights of all to the protection of privacy and information self-determination."
"We must also be aware, however, that in this age of mobility, there cannot be adequate security in Europe and worldwide without effective and rapid data exchange."
"In the digital age, we also have to ensure special protection as regards information self-determination and privacy."
"I therefore also consider it essential to make a more exact distinction between data needed to fight crime and sensitive private data."
"For me, there is no doubt that we must firmly integrate controls, the right of appeal, access rights, claims for damages, as well as the length of the retention period, in the agreement."
"Using the push method, it should be checked whether there can or need to be exceptions in urgent cases."
"As regards the use of PNR data, we should also include serious crime."
"To me, that includes offences like child pornography, people trafficking, murder, rape and also drug trafficking."
"In my opinion, this would also contribute to protecting the personal rights of those affected."
"I think it is good that we are taking a decision on the agreement on PNR data, in order to develop a basic model for all future agreements of this sort and to recommend a negotiating framework to the Commission, so that it takes into account our own ideas on data protection."
"Perhaps in future, there will also be room to consider combating terrorism and crime together with our transatlantic partners in a joint institution."
"That would certainly also be a step towards confronting globalised crime on a global scale."
"Madam President, there are a few basic things I would like to say about this agreement."
"There are, by all means, similarities with SWIFT, but also differences."
"If the European Parliament had to vote today on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, we would have no other option but to vote no."
"That is quite clear."
"There are still significant objections to this agreement."
"I will go into the details once more shortly."
"That is why I was not happy when we spoke about postponing the vote."
"However, unlike SWIFT, there were definitely good reasons for this postponement."
"Nevertheless, I will say quite clearly that, for us, it does not mean that the vote can be postponed indefinitely, so that we now have a provisional agreement for years on end."
"It is very important to us that we quickly reach a new negotiating mandate and, if possible, before the summer break, so that we can quickly gain clarity in detailed questions on how we should handle this data and what data should be included."
"Data protection plays an important role and here, I would like to use the opportunity to address once again the question as to what data should be transmitted."
"PNR covers 19 individual pieces of data."
"I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible - if you want to - to create personality profiles from these pieces of data."
"Now, of course, those with whom we have such an agreement are saying they have no interest in this, they will not do it and that relevant data is erased."
"However, if certain data that could be used to create a personality profile is not used at all, then we must consider whether it should indeed be collected, or - if we reach an agreement - whether all of the data needs to be transmitted."
"That is a crucial question."
"We also have to check what level of protection is afforded to data that is transmitted."
"We know that the regulations in both agreements with the USA and Australia are very different."
"With a view to further requests by other countries that want to have similar agreements, we should ensure that every time we reach an agreement, special standards apply."
"We also have to consider in detail the question of how this data is to be used."
"Originally, it was always said that it was about combating terrorism."
"Now however, it is also about serious crime."
"This can be discussed."
"However, we must go into great detail here."
"We know that even within the European Union itself, legal systems and legal culture vary greatly."
"This may mean that the definition of what constitutes a serious crime is completely different in terms of the type of crime."
"That means we need to look again in detail at what we are discussing when we say that serious crime should also naturally be included."
"I hope that in future, with the implementation of the agreement, we ensure that there is a regular exchange of information between the institutions."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that there has been a first review as far as the agreement with the USA is concerned."
"Officially, we still do not have these results yet."
"That was in February."
"In future, I would not only like to see reports being drawn up regularly, I would also like to see these reports actually being made available to the European Parliament immediately."
"It is very important to create a uniform agreement."
"The issue of data must be reviewed again."
"However, I believe that, on the basis of the previous discussion, we will probably reach a good agreement, and I therefore view further negotiations as something entirely positive."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, as rapporteur I would first of all like to thank the shadows for their excellent, pleasant and fruitful cooperation resulting in a joint resolution."
"Of course, this is not the final stage, as our talks on the topic and the text will continue."
"Today we consider the request for consent by the Council on the two agreements with the US and Australia."
"This House has always been highly critical of the use and transfer of PNR data."
"As a matter of fact, in 2004, Parliament sought the annulment of the agreement with the US before the European Court of Justice."
"It would therefore be inconsistent with our earlier positions to give consent without further ado."
"However, Parliament being responsible and cooperative as always, we agree that by rejecting the two agreements, we will create legal uncertainty and practical difficulties for citizens and carriers."
"So we propose instead to suspend the vote and request the Commission to develop a coherent approach to the use of PNR that is based on a single set of principles."
"I am very pleased to note that the Commission and the Council have embraced this strategy and that they are committed to working fast and flexibly."
"We urge the Commission in particular to submit the PNR package, as it is now dubbed, before the summer break."
"Such a coherent single approach seems the pragmatic option when more and more countries are requiring the transfer of passenger data."
"Then there is the lapsed PNR agreement with Canada - or whatever the legal status is, as this is not entirely clear - as well as the shelved proposal for an EU PNR."
"This draft resolution sets out a number of basic principles and minimum requirements for the PNR package, and they are, as it were, our conditions for consent."
"A key element or key word here is proportionality, because it must be demonstrated convincingly that the same end cannot be achieved with less intrusive means."
"This is really the key to everything."
"We specifically need to look at API data and ESTA in this context."
"We need, for example, to distinguish very clearly between the massive collection and use of data on all passengers for the purpose of automated searches such as profiling and data mining on the one hand, and targeted searches for known suspects on the other hand, identifying people who are, for example, on a no-fly or watch list."
"That is something completely different and we need to distinguish very carefully."
"Secondly, there must be a clear and strict purpose limitation in line with earlier resolutions, and we insist that data be used only for law-enforcement and security purposes and on the basis of very precise definitions of what that is: organised international crime and international terrorism."
"We need to make very clear what it is that we are talking about."
"Any use of PNR must be in line with EU data protection standards."
"It is our prime responsibility to represent the interests of our own European citizens."
"They have a right to know that we uphold European law in international relations and in our internal policies."
"Finally, we recognise the need to provide law-enforcement and security authorities with the necessary means to do their job in an era of unprecedented mobility, but Europe also has a duty to protect our rights and freedoms."
"I believe with the forthcoming PNR package we have a unique opportunity to get it right."
"Madam President, I do not want to repeat what my fellow Members quite rightly said before me, but rather make a few general remarks."
"I do not know whether you have ever seen the film Minority Report."
"If not, then I would recommend that you watch it."
"In this film, law enforcement agencies of the future use a so-called pre-crime system to try to arrest criminals before they have committed any crime."
"So-called pre-cops try to predict the future by constantly monitoring people's feelings and manners of behaviour."
"Great!"
"A seemingly infallible system that finally provides security."
"Then the chief investigator himself is targeted and the house of cards collapses."
"I do not want to irritate you just now by reviewing this great and still relevant film in even more detail, but the uncontrolled access to all passenger information of all people worldwide for the purpose of profiling and nothing else has been going on in the USA at least since 11 September 2001."
"This uncontrolled access contradicts not only all data protection regulations of the European Union, but fundamental constitutional principles, like the presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial and the prohibition of the arbitrary abuse of power."
"In our opinion, the agreements negotiated by the EU with the USA and Australia on access to Passenger Name Record data are a serious violation of European fundamental rights and provisions of the rule of law, and as the European Parliament we have mentioned this on several occasions, as Mrs in 't Veld has already made clear."
"As the European Parliament, we cannot support these, but call on the Commission and the Council to lay a new mandate on the table that puts the protection of citizens worldwide before such a pre-crime system."
"Madam President, I am not an illustrious film critic, as the previous speaker is."
"I would not like our debate to be a debate about cinema."
"Coming back specifically to the subject of our discussion, PNR data transfer should, in fact, be something obvious."
"It used to be that this data was gathered for commercial purposes, but today, it can be of good service in the fight against crime."
"However, this legitimate matter has become, in some sense, an element - let us say it sincerely - of a certain interinstitutional war which has been going on between the European Parliament and the Council for years."
"It is not good that a motion which, in my opinion, and the opinion of my group, is so very relevant and legitimate, was introduced by the Council independently, without any consultation with Parliament."
"For in this way, what is, in fact, a judicious motion, is now automatically being opposed by those who, even though they are in favour of data transfer, want to safeguard the European Parliament as a strong institution which is governed by its own laws and has a strong political will to make joint decisions."
"I have the impression that in the debate on PNR, those who support PNR data transfer are, paradoxically, in the opposing camp, because they do not like the way the Council treats Parliament."
"Let us say it plainly - we know from international experience that this is not the first time this has happened."
"Furthermore, even some of those who support PNR data transfer think we should, today, make a political demonstration and show the Council its place in the pecking order - in a word, to punish the Council for its arrogance."
"Finally, as a Polish saying goes, in this way we are, like it or not, throwing the baby out with the bathwater."
"We are, quite rightly, giving the Council a smack, but on the other hand we are, in a sense, limiting our own instruments in the fight against terrorism, the mafia and organised crime."
"Madam President, in contrast to previous speakers, I would like to compliment Mr Albrecht on his comparison with the world of film."
"I believe it is important from time to time to allow culture to highlight society's criticisms and it is something we could learn from here in Parliament."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs in 't Veld, for her commitment to the protection of privacy and the rule of law in this matter as in many others."
"The other day, the Spanish Presidency said that air travel is affecting the right to free movement, which is a fundamental right."
"That is something we should bear in mind today as we discuss PNR, because the intention behind the use of PNR data is to decide who has the right to fly and who does not have that right."
"Naturally, this affects our rights - not only the right to free movement, but also those under signed international conventions on our political and civil rights."
"The aim of the EU and of internal mobility is to make borders disappear and for the EU to result in greater freedom of movement."
"It does this for certain people, but for asylum seekers, refugees and so on - the bulk of whom are, in fact, women and children - the decision concerns whether or not they have the right to be allowed to fly."
"This can be a matter of life and death for these people."
"It is therefore important that we here in Parliament and in the Commission really look closely at how PNR data will be used."
"It concerns freedom of movement, but it also concerns international conventions and our civil rights."
"(MT) I would like to make three brief comments."
"First of all, we have just been talking about the SWIFT agreement and we said that it taught us certain lessons."
"I believe that one such lesson was learnt by Parliament, namely that greater power brings about greater responsibility."
"I believe that the strategy adopted by Parliament on the PNR agreement demonstrates that even Parliament understood that it has more power and therefore needs to shoulder greater responsibility."
"This is something that we would do well to emphasise."
"Secondly, is this agreement important or not?"
"In my opinion, it is very important indeed."
"Our fight against terrorism is important for our citizens' security and we carry great responsibility in this regard."
"Should an incident occur, our citizens will turn to us and ask, 'What did you do in order to safeguard our security?'"
"My third point: Does this agreement raise issues on data protection and citizens' privacy?"
"I believe that yes, it does, and it raises certain concerns that we need to address in detail so as to be able to reach an agreement that can guarantee and safeguard citizens' interests, especially concerning their privacy."
"Therefore, I believe that the resolution before us is good and well balanced."
"It clearly demonstrates what Parliament wants to achieve with respect to this agreement, in its bid to prove that we are exercising our powers with responsibility."
"Therefore, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of this resolution for her work on this dossier."
"(NL) Madam President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate on Passenger Name Record (PNR) data is very similar to the one we have just held on SWIFT."
"Basically, we are talking about the quest for a healthy, acceptable balance between security and the protection of privacy."
"Both are important, of course, and a careful balance needs to be struck between them."
"The problems in European aviation over recent days have demonstrated once more the essential role played by passenger and freight transport in the organisation of today's society."
"Just about everyone will travel by air sooner or later."
"Therefore, it is unacceptable for us to have dozens of items of data continually transferred and updated, often completely unwittingly, without there being cast-iron guarantees to prevent abuse; particularly as, for example, the US authorities already use a wide variety of information sources for a very long time to assess whether or not a person is suspicious, ranging from his or her visa application to check-in procedures at the airport."
"A few weeks ago, I was able to see for myself in the PNR centre in Washington how a whole team is working round the clock to reduce an initial rough list of approximately 5 000 people each day to a small list of a handful of people to be denied access to US territory."
"Evidently, only an administrative appeal is possible against such a ban on entering US territory."
"It is clear that this flow of data must remain confined within certain limits and that the minimum conditions set out in the resolution must be laid down, such as restricting the use of this data to the detection of terrorism and international crime."
"I agree with my fellow Members who have said that this must indeed be well defined, that all of this must, of course, be in keeping with the European data protection standards, and that this also applies when transferring data to further third countries where applicable."
"In my opinion, we also need to provide rather more clarity regarding the 'sensitive' PNR data, as I believe quite a few things are open to interpretation in this regard."
"Therefore, I support the proposed postponement, so as to enable a new negotiating mandate to be presented, sooner rather than later, that takes account of our questions."
"I take note of the constructive position of the Council and the Commission and, like my fellow Members, expect to see more clarity by the summer months."
"(NL) The tension has indeed eased a little, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mrs in 't Veld has drawn up a splendid resolution, one that is embraced by the Commission and the Council."
"That is excellent in itself, and I agree with her: I think it very prudent to state at this juncture that we are drawing up a single clear guideline for all future Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements that takes account of proportionality, which means transferring only the data truly and strictly necessary for the intended purpose, namely combating terrorism, and to make clear that this is the one and only objective."
"This guideline must also make provision for reciprocity and provide that data cannot be stored for years to come, that time limits are indeed set, and that we stand by our fundamental rights."
"The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has now been declared binding, and so that, too, will have to be reflected in such PNR agreements."
"Therefore, it strikes me as the right time to submit this to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna, and I should like to ask this of the Commission."
"There is one other thing we should take into account, which is that it has now become customary for citizens to communicate with a foreign state - in this case, often the United States - via an enterprise, namely an airline, that has nothing to do with it, should not actually need certain of my details, and should not be trying to play this mediating role."
"Something needs to be done about this."
"(DE) Madam President, freedom over the clouds, as the singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey once sang, will come to an abrupt end with the agreement with the USA on the retrieval of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data."
"In August, a member of our group staff experienced first hand the effects the restriction of this freedom is already having."
"Since the US authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists, the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross US air space."
"As we all know in this House, this had considerable disadvantages and it was later revealed that there had been a misunderstanding."
"Today, US authorities are already receiving a wide variety of data - credit card numbers, booking data, seating preferences, special food preferences, IP addresses and passenger information - without clear data protection regulations."
"I would like to say quite clearly that we reject that, as well as the bulk transfer of data relating to flying, referred to as PNR, as it now is to be developed."
"We cannot support it as it is currently formulated, because it is not for a specific purpose, and it is not proportionate or useful."
"Finally, I would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour."
"We need disclosure regulations like the USA's privacy act."
"These must be opened to European citizens."
"The way to legal action must likewise stand open to them."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, I too would firstly like to make a short comparison with the SWIFT debate."
"I was quite delighted to hear the representative of the Council talk of dedicated objectives in negotiations for this new SWIFT agreement."
"I am therefore quite surprised by the sort of effect and power the Treaty of Lisbon and the statement by Parliament have had on the Council, which now wants to champion the interests of Europe."
"I hope that we experience the same momentum now when we are talking about Passenger Name Record data, and that here there is also a commitment to fighting on behalf of European interests."
"Secondly, I would like to say that I believe we all agree that from the point of view of legal certainty for both airlines and citizens, when it is a question of data protection rights, such agreements make sense."
"The standards that we want have been set out clearly in the joint resolution."
"Thirdly, I would like to mention a point that is not directly connected with the agreements, but definitely relates to the subject, in other words, the debate in the Council as to whether we also need or should develop a European PNR system."
"The last major terror threat in Europe was the Detroit case when an attacker boarded a plane and wanted to fly to Detroit."
"That happened last year before Christmas."
"In this case, we learned that in the United Kingdom, we knew that this person was a threat."
"However, those who decided whether he could fly or not did not have the necessary information to hand."
"What I want to say here is that I believe that in the European Union, the problem is not whether there is enough data available."
"I believe that we already know who poses a threat."
"The problem is getting the data to where we need it in order to prevent threats."
"In Toledo, the Spanish Presidency proposed - and I am grateful for this - that we strengthen the networking of counter terrorism authorities in Europe."
"Unfortunately, this proposal was not taken up by the European interior ministers."
"Instead, there was the proposal to build new data sets and gather new data."
"It often seems to me that for the interior ministers, collecting new data is the easy option."
"I would firstly ask you to attend to the networking of the authorities involved; then we would achieve a lot in the fight against terror."
"(SL) I firmly believe that all Members of the European Parliament are aware of the importance of timely and accurate information in ensuring the safety of their many journeys."
"Today, as we face air traffic chaos, the scale of the daily movement of passengers is much more obvious to us all."
"Unfortunately, the financial losses of many airlines bear a rather obvious testament to that because of the missed flights and the crowds that have been and are still waiting for a seat on the first available flight."
"I hope now that we will soon be able to fly safely again."
"Any passenger who travels by aeroplane discloses their data explicitly only to the authorities responsible for combating terrorism and organised crime."
"I have no quarrel with that. If I voluntarily post details of when and where I am travelling on Twitter, then I do not mind such information being used in ensuring day-to-day air traffic security."
"What I do object to, however, is the fact that PNR agreements do not set predetermined conditions and criteria for all countries equally, that they do not specify the data we need to disclose and that we do not know the exact purposes for which such data will be used by the authorities."
"My question to you is as follows: can we expect to be given a mandate to negotiate a new agreement on the transfer of data records before or during the summer?"
"Furthermore, will all agreements between the European Union and individual countries that wish to enter into them be model agreements and agreements with equal, high and clear standards for the use and protection of data?"
"What action will you take to prevent PNR data being used in the profiling and definition of risk factors?"
"The point I wish to make is that any possibility of allowing personality profiling based on ethnic origin, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, sex, age or health is unacceptable."
"To this, I would like to add that no data collection system is sufficient in itself."
"We cannot prevent attempted terrorist attacks without sound data exchange and cooperation of the intelligence services."
"A very good reminder of that was the failed attack on the aeroplane flying to Detroit around Christmas last year."
"What we need, above all, is to use efficiently the instruments we already have in the fight against terrorism and, in particular, better cooperation."
"To conclude, I definitely do not want to say 'no' to an agreement that would offer security to us all, citizens of the EU."
"Still less do I want to see our fundamental privacy rights being violated."
"However, it is right that any intrusion into our privacy should be balanced with security and efficiency of measures and with the protection of human rights."
"(DE) Madam President, today we have before us the second dossier of an agreement with the USA that is beset with huge problems in matters of data protection."
"That actually brings me to the confirmation of the proposal by our European Data Protection Supervisor, Mr Hustinx, who said that it would make sense to once and for all negotiate and conclude a comprehensive transatlantic framework agreement on data protection."
"That would be a rewarding task for both sides and would help us in many ways."
"In general it is clear that we have completely different concepts of security here and on the other side of the Atlantic."
"As the European Parliament, we must also ensure that our Commission does not merely accept what the USA proposes, but brings our standards into these negotiations with a sense of proportion and on an equal footing."
"Therefore, a definition of the term 'serious crime' is vital."
"Clear correction of data must be possible."
"For us, data protection must be activated, otherwise this agreement is a non-starter."
"(PT) Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, we have shown our concern about the transfer of PNR data to the United States."
"Such data may be kept for years after the safety checks have been carried out, and there is no legal protection for anyone who is not a US citizen."
"The agreements we have concluded with both Australia and Canada have always been more acceptable and more in line with the principle of proportionality, as they allow for limited access in scope, in time and in the number of details, as well as oversight by a judicial authority."
"I agree that general principles and rules should be laid down as a basis for making any agreements with third countries."
"We may, in fact, see an avalanche of similar requests from other countries whose traditions regarding data protection and respect for human rights give greater cause for concern."
"In addition, if we want true reciprocity, we will have to consider creating a single system for the European Union that involves Europol throughout the process."
"Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, in my opinion, any agreement will only be acceptable if guarantees of a suitable level of data protection are given, respecting the principles of necessity and proportionality and the EU rules in force."
"It is also vital to ensure that only the 'push' method is used; in other words, the data must be supplied by us and not automatically drawn out by bodies in third countries that are given access to our databases."
"I therefore support the joint proposal by the rapporteur Mrs in 't Veld and the political groups to postpone the vote on Parliament's consent, so as to give more time for the negotiations to meet the concerns that we have expressed here."
"(RO) The protection of personal data is one of the fundamental rights of European citizens."
"The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens previous provisions thanks to the legal and mandatory nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Any personal data must be processed in accordance with Directives 46/1995, 58/2002 and 24/2006."
"In fact, the European Parliament requests that any international agreement concerning personal data be signed subject to the signatories having in force similar provisions to those contained in the directives mentioned above."
"In the information society and particularly during the development of the broadband communication infrastructure, the Data Storage Centre and the Data Processing Centre can be situated in different locations or even different countries."
"This is why we are asking that any international agreement concerning personal data stipulates the requirement for personal data to be stored and processed only in locations which have similar legal provisions to those contained in European legislation."
"One last point, Madam President: how can European citizens give their consent and, in particular, under what conditions?"
"Madam President, I would like to make three comments by way of a conclusion on our part in this important debate."
"The first concerns the point raised by Mr Weber as to whether Europe can or should have its own passenger name record data system, and what scope it might have."
"We are in favour of there actually being a general regulation on the transfer of passenger - essentially air passenger - data."
"We have therefore asked the Commission to carry out a study and, if appropriate, to prepare a draft directive laying down a general regulation in that respect including - as Mrs in 't Veld's motion for a resolution states - a privacy impact assessment."
"That is to say, to what extent do effectiveness and proportionality, two principles that we have to take into account, impact on privacy and, therefore, how far should a European regulation go in this respect and what measures ought to be adopted in any case to protect fundamental rights?"
"That is what Mrs Fayot mentioned: what measures ought to be adopted?"
"I think the debate we had on SWIFT may clarify matters."
"I believe the principles we discussed then and agreed upon should be present here."
"We are talking about the right to privacy, the right to a private life, the right to one's person and one's own image, which must always be preserved."
"Fundamental rights are indivisible, and in this case we are dealing with something that could jeopardise fundamental rights, so I believe we have to act with the same care that we talked about in the previous debate."
"Lastly, my third comment is connected with the previous one."
"As a general thought, it does not seem to me that security and freedom are two opposed principles or, in other words, that it is a kind of zero-sum game and that as we provide greater security, we will have less freedom, or as we give greater protection to fundamental rights and freedoms and are fundamentalist in protecting our fundamental rights, we will have less security."
"I think that is a false dilemma."
"On the contrary, I believe that security and freedom are two principles that enhance each other."
"Both principles are therefore expressed and recognised in constitutions and in European legislation, and they are both present in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We must always bear in mind that there is a Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty of Lisbon, a charter requiring respect for fundamental rights, which is absolutely sacred and must not be violated."
"I believe, therefore, that, when we think beyond the short term - because sometimes our thinking is very constrained by the short term - and think about the long term, the measures designed to protect our security, if prudent and well thought out, always prove to be effective."
"Protecting rights and freedoms is always something that improves citizens' well-being and, in the end, their security as well."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, yes, I have seen the film Minority Report."
"It is a good and interesting film, quite scary, and this is not what we are trying do with this."
"I think this has been a very interesting and constructive debate and I agree that there are similarities with the SWIFT or TFTP discussions."
"It is about fighting serious organised crime and terrorism, but it is also about how we protect the privacy of the individual."
"It raises questions of data protection, of proportionality, clarification of the purposes, definitions, legal certainties, etc."
"The negotiations on the TFTP with our American friends will also give us important experiences that we can bring into the PNR discussions."
"It will help us further clarify the thinking of the European Union and get closer on this, which I think will be helpful."
"I think the TFTP work we have been doing so far between the three institutions has given us experiences on how we can work together - the Council, Parliament and the Commission - on these extremely difficult and sensitive issues."
"Hopefully, we will have good results."
"I have listened carefully to the debate."
"I have read your resolution."
"I think it is a very balanced and wise resolution."
"As I said, we will start working immediately based on that and I am looking forward to good cooperation and discussions with you in working on this."
"As you know, I had already promised Parliament during the course of my hearing that I would carry out an overview of all the anti-terrorist measures we have at our disposal in the European Union - to identify them, have a list of them and discuss them with Parliament - and also of the overall architecture of all our data information and sharing systems, so that we have this in our mind when we start our work."
"I think this is important and I think it will increase the transparency and depth of our discussions."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for this collaboration;"
"I hope it will be fruitful."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the first part-session in May."
"Ban on use of cyanide mining technologies (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Ãder and Mr TÅkÃ©s, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), on the ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies - B7-0206/2010)."
"author. - (HU) Fellow Members, very important decisions have been taken in the European Union over the past few years aimed at protecting our environment."
"I would mention just the decision regarding biodiversity or the Water Framework Directive."
"The EU's Water Framework Directive makes Member States responsible for protecting water quality and preventing pollution."
"Is this a worthy goal?"
"Yes, it is."
"Is it our responsibility to do everything we can in order to reach this goal?"
"Clearly it is."
"Are there any mining technologies that endanger our waters and our environment?"
"Unfortunately, there are."
"Moreover, there is one extremely dangerous and, at the same time, obsolete technology in particular."
"Along with quite a few fellow Members, I would like this technology to be banned throughout the European Union."
"The cyanide disaster on the Tisza River ten years ago, as well as accidents that have occurred since then, also serve as reminders of this problem."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the present moment is one that is both fortunate and pressing."
"Fortunate, because according to the information received from the Commission, today only three countries still use this cyanide-based mining technology, and it is fortunate also because there are three other countries that have banned cyanide mining technology, thus setting an example for the other EU Member States."
"At the same time, it is also pressing since, on account of the rising price of gold, there are plans to open new mines throughout Europe using this dangerous and obsolete technology."
"This represents a serious threat to our environment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we are serious about the need to protect our waters, we cannot create cyanide-poisoned lakes alongside our rivers and lakes."
"Yet this is the result of this obsolete technology."
"If we are serious about safeguarding biodiversity, we cannot allow the use of technologies that can kill all forms of life in our rivers, from micro-organisms to crabs and fish."
"The time is ripe, distinguished fellow Members, to take action."
"Let us not wait for a new catastrophe to warn us of this."
"Finally, please allow me to thank all those fellow Members who are present and those who will participate in the debate, but who are unable to be here due to the eruption of the volcano, who have done a lot to help prepare this proposal for a decision, and thanks to whom we were able to present this House with a joint proposal for a text that is the fruit of compromise and that is supported not only by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) but also the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists."
"I believe that, given the seriousness of the matter, this is absolutely justified."
"I would ask my fellow Members to continue their support through the final stage of the decision-making process."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, my colleague, Commissioner Piebalgs excuses himself."
"Unfortunately, he cannot be here with you today, so he has entrusted me with the task of taking this debate with you."
"Thank you for this opportunity to explain the Commission's position on the use of cyanide for gold extraction in the European Union."
"First, as the honourable Member knows, we have had a careful and very comprehensive study of the dramatic accident and the causes of it at Baia Mare in Romania in 2000 when a dam retaining toxic substances broke."
"The conclusions of that study were taken on board when the European Union adopted in 2006 a specific directive on the management of extracted waste."
"The deadline for Member States to transpose this was only two years ago and it is still regarded as an up-to-date, proportionate and appropriate approach to the risk of using cyanide."
"The directive includes several requirements to improve the safety of extractive waste management facilities and limit their impact on the environment."
"Explicit and precise requirements are set on the construction and the management of waste facilities which have to be operated using the 'best available technique' concept."
"A full accident prevention policy is required for the facilities in which toxic substances are treated or stored."
"Emergency plans to be used in case of accidents must be established, not only by the operator but also by the competent authorities."
"Clear information requirements are included in the directive if trans-boundary impacts are expected."
"This legislation also incorporates requirements for the closure of extraction facilities, and for after closure."
"It includes the obligation to set up an underwritten financial guarantee for each installation before the beginning of the operation."
"The directive includes strict maximum limit values of cyanide concentration before this substance is stored in ponds for remaining residues to be broken down by oxidation, sunlight or bacteria."
"In practice, in order to meet the strict limit values, it is necessary to install specific equipment destroying most of the cyanide before its storage in the pond."
"To our best knowledge, unfortunately, no adequate alternatives to cyanide use for gold extraction exist on the market."
"In most European deposits, gold is bound with other metals meaning that a separation method is required."
"A total cyanide ban would imply stopping European extraction and consequently increase gold imports, often from countries with lower environmental and social standards."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is following technology development in the sector and, if alternative techniques emerge in the coming years, the debate might very well be reopened."
"In the meantime, a good implementation of this directive is essential to guarantee the safety of these facilities and minimise the risk associated with their management."
"Let me also point out that Member States are responsible for deciding on whether to open gold mines on their territories."
"The Commission's role is to ensure full implementation of the directive and good implementation and enforcement is a priority."
"Under the directive, the Member States are bound to provide the Commission with information on implementation no later than 2012 and we, in turn, are obliged to analyse and report on this basis."
"That will obviously be the right time for us to assess the effectiveness of this approach and if, at that point, the current approach were found to be ineffective, we should not rule out the possibility of an outright ban."
"In conclusion, I would like to insist on the importance of ensuring high waste-recycling rates and improved resource efficiency in the extraction sector."
"Even without considering the use of cyanide, mining for gold is far from kind to the environment."
"To extract 1 g of gold, it is necessary to move and treat, on average, 5 000 kg of ore."
"The same amount can be obtained through the recycling of approximately 5 kg of old mobile phones."
"This example illustrates the importance of increasing the separate collection and recycling of waste - in this case, electronic and electrical waste which can contain gold and other similar precious metals."
"This is why resource efficiency is a priority for this Commission."
"Madam President, I am pleased that Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m is here, but in this case, I would rather have seen her colleague Mr PotoÄnik, the responsible Commissioner, because this problem is for him to solve."
"I would like to say first of all that Europe produces 0.73% of the world's gold and that gold is currently being mined in Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Romania and Sweden."
"Not all use these dangerous cyanide technologies."
"I would also like to point out that the task force that was set up to investigate the accident in Baia Mare has established that the plant design was unsuitable for the storage and disposal of mine waste, that the authorisation of this design was not checked by the supervisory authorities and that there was insufficient monitoring of the damming and plant operation, so there were many mistakes on the part of the plant operator."
"As the Commissioner has correctly established, we have learned from this accident."
"However, I believe the Commission should draw further conclusions in view of this very dangerous technology."
"Since, to my knowledge, the alternative technologies that are on the market do not yet offer the results that we actually want, we should also consider what we can do in the area of research and development, to secure the future of gold production, but also to guarantee plant safety."
"On many occasions, Europe has committed itself to adhering to high environmental protection standards."
"I would remind you of the Water Framework Directive that clearly aims to prevent these hazards, but also commitments in the area of biodiversity."
"Therefore, I ask you, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, to pass on to Commissioner PotoÄnik our clear demand that progress be made in the area of gold production on the part of the Commission, the European legislator."
"The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament unreservedly supports the ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies, because I would like to call the Commissioner's attention to the fact that it is not enough for the Commission to act after the event."
"Unfortunately, in European environmental protection - and, in particular, in the Committee on Petitions - there are numerous examples where environmental pollution begins and continues without us being able to prevent it; therefore the European Union must henceforth make prevention its aim."
"My colleagues, Mr Ãder and Mr Seeber, also referred to the cyanide disaster at the mine in Baia Mare."
"When we are urging a ban on the use of cyanide in mining, in gold mining, we are doing so based on the experience of a specific, very sad environmental catastrophe."
"With regard to the current investment at RoÅia MontanÄ, the plans involve an exponentially larger gold mine."
"There are numerous problems surrounding the investment."
"There is no guarantee that the surface extraction accompanying the investment will not transform the landscape."
"A great deal of poison will be released into the environment."
"The expected lifetime of the mine is only 20 years, and it will create scarcely any jobs."
"There is no guarantee that the investor will restore the environment after the mining is finished."
"For all these reasons, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, are not only launching the initiative but are also asking the Commission to draw up legislation by 2010 or 2011 definitively banning the use of cyanide in mining within the European Union, because environmental pollution does not stop at national borders."
"Even if a few countries ban the use of cyanide in gold mining, this is useless if we do not solve the problem at EU level."
"Madam President, this is a very important topic that we are debating, because cyanide is an exceptionally dangerous substance."
"We do not accept what the Commission representative has said about there being no safe techniques."
"We consider that the three current investment plans to mine gold using cyanide in Greece should be dealt with by banning this technique."
"In Evros, in Rodopi and in Halkidiki, there has been strong reaction from the local communities and the Supreme Administrative Court in Greece, the Council of State, has handed down decisions."
"The threat of the involvement of the International Monetary Fund, as a result of the crisis in my country, is causing fears of possible pressure to relax legislation to protect the environment and controls."
"There are practices and experiences from other countries with tragic results."
"In Greece, the dangers come from the exploitation of gold in Bulgaria, which is the Evros catchment basin."
"Also, there is the question of the Turkish shores and the related threats to the Aegean."
"There are also similar plans in other countries."
"However, Hungary, as we already know, decided just last December to ban all cyanide-based mining work."
"There should also be support from European legislation, with a full ban and the simultaneous creation of a safety network for economically vulnerable countries such as Greece."
"We are calling for the weak legislation of the European Union to become more decisive and for different levels in permitted pollutants for each Member State to be abolished."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I wish to say that we consider the matter to be extremely serious; it needs immediate action and this is no time for obstruction."
"The Commission and the position which it is maintaining are relaxed and the directive is full of holes and does not prevent the dangers to which other members referred."
"The importance and the repercussions of the use of cyanide in metal mining are well documented and we have seen what happened in Romania."
"One member referred earlier to mining programmes being prepared at present in Greece."
"When I asked the Commission about the creation of cyanide-based gold mines in Bulgaria, the Commission's reply increased my fears and the need for this legislation to be stricter and to be applied more decisively."
"We are certain that citizens will obviously react, but we too must act."
"We therefore join our voice with everyone calling for a complete ban on the use of cyanide in metal mining and every country should commit to such a ban, as Hungary did recently."
"The representatives of EU bodies often like to place great emphasis publicly on protecting the health of our citizens and protecting nature and the environment."
"It is therefore striking that European regulations are almost suspiciously inconsistent when it comes to the use of a highly toxic chemical substance, cyanide, in the mining of precious metals."
"It is well-known among professionals that cyanide is one of the most toxic of all chemical substances."
"It gets into the organism by inhalation through undamaged skin or after use."
"At sufficient concentrations, death follows in a few seconds or minutes."
"The arguments of mining companies that they can ensure conditions for gold mining that will prevent the risk of damage to health or the environment have always proved worthless."
"Sometimes, there is human error and sometimes nature springs a surprise."
"This can be seen from dozens of serious accidents all over the world, which have resulted in the extensive destruction of nature, harm to health and also loss of life."
"Let us recall just a few from recent years: Summitville in Colorado, Carson Hill in California, Brewer in South Carolina, Harmony in South Africa, Omai in Guyana, Gold Quarry in Nevada, Zortman-Landusky in Montana, Kumtor in Kyrgyzstan, Homestake in South Dakota, Placer in the Philippines, Baia Mare in Romania and Tolukuma in Papua New Guinea."
"In all of these places, both the inhabitants and nature paid dearly for the greed of the modern-day gold diggers, facilitated by the indifference of the authorities."
"Commissioner, the time has come to show the people of the EU what really matters to you: the environment and people's health and lives, or the profits of mining companies."
"(RO) We must agree that the ban on the use of cyanide in mining will become a priority issue for the environment not only in Romania, but throughout the whole of Europe as well."
"More than 25 major accidents and discharges have occurred worldwide between 1998 and 2006, making it increasingly obvious that cyanide has been posing a constant hazard to the environment for decades."
"These mining accidents raise a number of questions about practices and the application of regulations governing the management of cyanide, even if the companies involved are well-meaning."
"In addition, the difficulty in managing the transport, storage and use of cyanide, combined with shortcomings in operating and maintaining tailing ponds, not to mention bad weather, can result in explosive situations, with a devastating impact on the environment."
"There are alternatives to the use of cyanide in mining, but they are not promoted by the mining industry, even though regulations are applied at European Union level to actively promote new emerging technologies which are safe."
"In November 2005, MEPs and Member States adopted the Mining Waste Directive."
"This directive is an ineffective legislative instrument, resulting from great pressure exerted by the mining industry and concerns expressed by the countries in Central and Eastern Europe with regard to waiving any request and responsibility for cleaning up old, abandoned mining sites."
"Some of the loopholes in the directive become obvious if we consider that it does not, for instance, refer to cyanide emissions in air."
"Let us take the example of the RoÅia MontanÄ mining development in Alba County."
"If operations get under way, it is estimated that 134.2 kg of cyanide will be emitted into the air every day, which will happen every day of normal operation."
"This means an annual volume of 48 983 kg of emissions or 783 728 kg over the mine's 16-year operating life."
"In addition, there is not even any European legislation on air quality for such emissions."
"In this context, it is our moral duty to future generations, and in keeping with the global trends on banning the use of cyanide in mining, to support this legislative proposal."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are marking the tenth anniversary of a large-scale environmental catastrophe involving the escape of cyanide into European rivers from a Romanian gold mine, we are voting on a resolution in which we demand an EU-wide ban on the extraction of gold through the use of cyanide."
"This is an extremely dangerous technique, not only in case of accidents, which threaten wide areas, but also because it imposes an environmental burden in the course of extraction which can no longer be tolerated."
"For every tonne of rock contaminated with a highly toxic material, which is broken down only with great difficulty in the environment, only a few grams of gold are extracted."
"At the same time, very many tonnes of this toxic rock are created."
"Moreover, the objections of most foreign mine owners to our activities are unfounded, since there are other, safer, if rather more expensive, methods of extraction."
"I would like to ask for your support in the vote on our joint resolution, through which we call on the European Commission to ban the cyanide-based technology within the EU from 2012, and also for both the Commission and the Member States not to support mining projects using cyanide within the EU or in third countries."
"The ban is already applied today in the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary, and other countries should also ban this mining technique."
"I consider it essential for mining companies to have mandatory insurance cover against damages caused through accidents, including the cost of restoring areas affected by accidents to their original state."
"I would like to end by emphasising that the insignificant profits obtained through the cheaper extraction of gold using cyanide cannot relieve us of the responsibility for a functioning ecosystem and for conserving the ecosystem for future generations."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, after Chernobyl, we all understand the nuclear risk."
"In 2000, however, the second biggest environmental disaster in the history of Europe - perhaps even in the history of the world - was caused by the accident at Baia Mare in Romania, to which numerous members have referred."
"One hundred thousand cubic metres of water with very high concentrations of cyanide and other heavy metals leaked from a gold mine into the Tisza River and from there into the Danube, affecting Hungary and Serbia, as well as Romania, killing tens of thousands of fish and poisoning the drinking water."
"The contamination of the food chain in the areas directly affected was long term."
"Hungary reported 1 367 tonnes of dead fish."
"Over 100 persons, mainly children, were poisoned from eating contaminated fish and were treated immediately."
"Nonetheless, not only does gold mining involving the use of cyanide solvents continue, not only is it not banned at European level; on the contrary, the investments in question are subsidised by the Member States and the European Union."
"Mining is continuing or is being planned in Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece, while it is banned by law in Hungary and the Czech Republic and by case-law in Germany."
"The time when we sacrificed the local environment and our citizens' health for jobs is long gone."
"Even the economic viability of this particular activity would collapse if the principle of prevention and the 'polluter pays' principle were applied."
"Every economic activity is welcome, provided that it is in keeping with environmental protection and protection of our citizens' health."
"However, when we use cyanide, we expose both the environment and our citizens' health to irreparable danger."
"Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m, are you in a position to assure us that we shall have adequate and strong legislation and that Baia Mare will not be repeated this time in Sweden, Finland, Bulgaria or Greece?"
"I call on the Commission to prove that it honours the undertakings which it made just two months ago before the European Parliament."
"I add my voice to those of the local communities which are the first to suffer the consequences and join in the fight by environmental movements, while calling for an immediate ban on the use of cyanide in gold mining inside the European Union."
"(EL) Madam President, Commission, the gold is sitting there; it cannot escape."
"What we are being called upon to debate is when, how and with what environmental impact we decide to mine it."
"If an investment is implemented with the use of cyanide, the repercussions are irreversible, because the gold is gone and the slurry, which contains dangerous toxic cyanides, as the directive itself admits, remains in large quantities in the mining area."
"This issue does not only concern the Member States in question, because there are also Member States downstream whose installations are sited on rivers."
"The existing directive has one disadvantage: the financial guarantee provided for does not cover all the repercussions in the event of an accident, especially after the installations in question have shut down."
"Consequently, the basic 'polluter pays' principle is being infringed, especially given that the companies using this technique are basically outside Europe and, once mining has finished, they get out their handkerchief and wave goodbye to us."
"Therefore, we need to seriously re-examine alternative mining methods and reinstate the basic 'polluter pays' principle, with full and reliable insurance cover in the event of an accident, from now and for as long as these dangerous substances remain trapped in the earth."
"Until these preconditions apply, I believe that there should be a complete ban on this technology, which will probably motivate companies to carry out serious research into alternative, less polluting techniques because, if you have a cheap method and do not pay for the pollution it causes, you have no reason to research alternatives."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I decided to speak on the topic in hand because I followed in detail events surrounding the prospecting and opening of the Mokrsko and KaÅ¡perskÃ© Hory deposits in the Czech Republic, where finely dispersed gold was to have been extracted through cyanidation."
"At that time, in the mid-1990s, we considered the environmental impact of the chemical substances used and the fact that cyanidation involves processing huge volumes of ore, in addition to which there were the harmful effects not only of the cyanide but also of the substances used for so-called de-cyanidation, which are chlorine and calcium oxide."
"There is also the further compelling fact that harmful accompanying elements can be mobilised through the use of these processes."
"These elements especially include arsenic, which is highly hazardous and is often contained in arsenic pyrite, a very frequent accompanying mineral."
"In many cases, I am personally a supporter of mining as a necessary precondition for technological progress, but where the cyanidation of gold ore deposits is concerned, I oppose this technology and I am delighted that, in 2000, an amendment of the Mining Act in the Czech Republic excluded it from the permissible methods of treating gold."
"In view of the major risks connected with cyanidation, it would be a good thing to exclude this technology, not only in the EU but also worldwide. This is because the risks of cyanidation are disproportionately high in third world countries in particular, where there are lower levels of environmental protection."
"Commissioner, are you sure that new alternative technologies and new kinds of separation and flotation separation have been properly considered?"
"(SK) First, I would like to thank the initiators, namely Mr Ãder and Mr TÅkÃ©s, for raising this very serious issue."
"I would like to support as strongly as possible the draft resolution on a general ban on cyanide technologies in mining throughout the European Union."
"Anyone who experienced and saw the results of the environmental catastrophe caused by the failure of the technology in Baia Mare, and the subsequent release of toxic cyanide effluents into water courses, with far-reaching effects on fauna in the Tisza River in Hungary, as well as the Danube in Bulgaria, would do everything possible to ensure that something similar could never happen again in the European Union."
"My own country, Slovakia, was seriously affected by the catastrophe, since it took place along our borders."
"Moreover, there is a similar threat in Slovakia from the reopening of several old mines for precious metals, where the use of cyanide technology is under consideration due to the low concentrations of the precious metals."
"It would be completely mistaken and incorrect to characterise this process as a bilateral affair between two Member States of the EU."
"I hope that the Commission will take a rather more determined position than the one shown here by the Commissioner."
"Through the adoption of the resolution, we must stand up for a general and broad defence of European values in our environmental policy."
"(RO) I would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for the balanced position which she presented in opening this debate."
"Technologies which use cyanide are hazardous."
"However, there are also other technologies which are just as hazardous, for instance, the production of nuclear technology."
"There are regulations, standards and norms in place to prevent accidents."
"We do not need to apply a ban; we simply have to observe the rules."
"The resolution mentions 30 accidents over the last 25 years."
"It does not specify how many of them occurred in Europe because there have been very few, mainly in countries which were not members of the European Union at the time of the accident."
"In fact, the Commission tightened up the regulations as a result of the unfortunate accident which occurred in 2000."
"Cyanide technology is used to obtain a variety of products, including even pharmaceutical products and vitamins."
"The resolution only discusses mining and, specifically, gold production."
"Why?"
"The reason is that the problem is not actually with cyanide but with gold."
"Not only is there a request to ban this technology, but also to halt ongoing projects by the date of the supposed ban."
"The only future project I am aware of in Europe involving the mining of gold is in Romania."
"Fellow Members, I would like to ask you to read the resolution text closely; in particular, statements such as 'heavy rain in the future will increase the risk of leaks' or 'the mining industry offers few job opportunities and only then with limited prospects of 16 years' or 'human negligence may occur because some Member States are incapable of enforcing the legislation'."
"I do not think that such statements have any place in a European Parliament text."
"This is why, fellow Members, please weigh up both the reasons for and consequences of voting against a resolution which diminishes our credibility before the Commission and reduces the chance of the motions for resolutions approved in the European Parliament being taken into consideration not only in the current case, but also in general."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the use of cyanide compounds in the mining industry is obviously an issue which no one can be indifferent to."
"We are aware of the legal measures which the European Union has adopted."
"They convey a clear message: we must continue to guarantee a high level of protection for people's health and the environment through the use of appropriate resources, structures, control mechanisms and management systems."
"Continuing to mobilise public opinion in Europe is also part of our mission."
"However, when this is done by playing on people's fears and using the environmental card to protect interests of another kind, the stance adopted completely loses its merit."
"According to SRE Consulting's report, the majority of cyanide compounds currently used on an industrial scale are used for the purposes of the chemical industry and the surface treatment of metals."
"This means that, even though we ban their use in the mining of gold, they will continue to be used for other purposes and our ban will not result in a significant decrease in their use as a whole."
"I totally support the absolute need to evaluate the impact on the environment and for both operators and control authorities in our countries to exercise preliminary and subsequent control."
"At present, my country, Bulgaria, does not have an explicit ban on the use of cyanide compounds in the mining of gold."
"In this case, the use of other technologies, especially during the current crisis, has not proved to be more effective."
"This does not mean that we are making compromises, but that we are listening to the voice of reason and not going to extremes."
"This is why the bridge connecting one group of people opposed to any ban to the group of people holding a different view passes through you."
"This is a bridge which, I urge you, we must not burn."
"Mr President, I agree that tailings dams such as the one that caused the accident in Baia Mare in 2000 should not be created."
"Finland is a big gold producer by European standards."
"The new mine in KittilÃ¤ is the biggest in Europe with a yearly production of 5 000 kg of gold."
"Now we have to remember one scientific fact; gold does not dissolve in liquids other than cyanide."
"Therefore, the extraction process in KittilÃ¤ also involves cyanide, but in closed processes."
"Cyanide used in processing the enriched slurry is reused and the residuals of cyanide are destroyed after the process."
"Even the residuals of cyanide in the water recovered from tailings dams are purified."
"Bacteria-based extraction would be more nature-friendly, but it is not yet used for gold."
"The first mine in the world to use microbial extraction from heaps of nickel ore is in Talvivaara, also in Finland."
"Microbial purification of residual cyanide is being developed with good results and I strongly recommend moving in that direction."
"Therefore, I do not support a move to ban the use of cyanide totally but I would certainly encourage strict environmental controls with the best available technology and closed processes."
"(RO) I believe that the initiative on banning the use of cyanide-based technology in gold mining is unjustified."
"There are a number of European legislative acts in force in this area, as already mentioned earlier, which have increasingly tightened the regulations on the conditions for using cyanide, starting right from the time of the unfortunate accident mentioned earlier, which occurred in Baia Mare and regrettably resulted in contamination."
"Therefore, our efforts should focus on enforcing this legislative framework strictly at national level in each Member State in this situation."
"Cyanide-based technology has been used for extracting gold for over 100 years under conditions ensuring the environment's safety and as part of an efficient process for extracting gold."
"In fact, 90% of the gold extracted worldwide over the last 20 years has been extracted using this technology and not an alternative."
"The technical regulations governing the use and neutralisation of cyanide have helped minimise the risks to the environment and workers' health."
"I believe I must also stress that the proper application of the precautionary principle does not involve an emotional response which would take the form of a ban on a technology which has proven its benefit and whose risks are completely known and controllable."
"When applying the precautionary principle, consideration must also be given to the risks to the environment arising from the use of other agents similar to cyanide as an alternative."
"In any case, experts say that using such alternative agents poses greater risks than using cyanide."
"(HU) Allowing or banning mining ventures that use cyanide raises sensitive issues in certain Member States."
"First of all, we must establish that solving this problem cannot be held hostage to political intentions and interests."
"Assessing the danger of pollution is a matter for experts, and if there is such a danger, then it is up to political leaders to protect citizens' interests."
"On this point, the question goes beyond environmental protection concerns, since pollution can endanger people's health, in contravention of the right of EU citizens to a high level of health protection (Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights)."
"In this area, there can be no question of small or large risk."
"If the health of citizens is put at risk, then political debate is pointless and the authorities must take action against the potential polluter."
"Although the use of cyanide is banned in certain Member States and allowed in others, Member States must consult each other and aim at forming partnerships."
"The Commission, for its part, should take a stand on the matter and initiate regulations that exclude the possibility of damage to the health of EU citizens."
"(FI) Mr President, as I come from the gold country of Northern Lapland, I want to make my contribution in this debate."
"Just as Mrs Essayah said in her excellent speech, gold is dissolved by using cyanide, and this is happening in closed processes in Finland."
"In the KittilÃ¤ goldmine, which is fairly close to where I live, over 5 000 kilos of gold are produced in a year."
"There have been no problems, because environmental issues have been dealt with in such a way that legislation is up to date, the processes are closed and the residuals are destroyed."
"Technology is also significant there."
"In this matter, there are certainly a considerable number of differences between European countries, and I believe that we need to have cooperation and exchange best practices."
"Another important matter is the use of microbes, which is a new innovation."
"We must invest in this in the future as well, so that we can move to an even more environmentally friendly and effective procedure for dissolving gold. We must make a concerted effort across Europe so that mining activity can continue while taking account of the environment in a sustainable way."
"(DE) Mr President, the speeches by Mrs RoithovÃ¡, Mr BÅezina and Mr MÃ©szÃ¡ros really convinced me, since they described how there was similarly indiscriminate exploitation in the country in which they lived previously, namely Communist Czechoslovakia, how there has been a change in attitude and how today, they are the ones who are advocating environmental protection and common European standards."
"I believe we need this change in attitude throughout Europe."
"We must be aware of the fact that we are in the process of developing new technologies."
"Why not stretch out the mining of a reserve that is running out anyway and first of all develop these new technologies?"
"I would like to make one point quite clear: if we are not careful, something irretrievable will be destroyed and future generations will damn us for it."
"I therefore really must ask for a long-term approach here."
"It is crucial that we have uniform European standards, since rivers cross borders and cyanide is, of course, also an environmental hazard that crosses borders."
"(RO) I agree that every measure must be taken at European Union level to reduce the purported risks from using toxic, hazardous substances such as cyanide."
"However, banning these substances must not be viewed as the only solution."
"Toxic, hazardous substances are used in many industrial processes other than mining."
"Apart from the accident in Baia Mare in 2000, there have been a further two major accidents in the mining sector: one which occurred in Spain in 1998, and the other in Sweden in 2003, both of greater magnitude."
"However, their causes were similar: tailing ponds which collapsed."
"More than 90% of gold and silver production carried out globally uses cyanide-based technology for extracting the metals."
"Imposing an unconditional ban on this technology and replacing it with technologies based on substances which pose smaller risks to the environment, but which are exorbitant and produce lower yields, means that the relevant country has to actually stop extracting these metals, with the economic and social repercussions this entails."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Takkula has just said, cyanide technology is a common method in mining."
"However, as we have heard, it is highly dangerous."
"The disaster that Mrs BÄsescu just mentioned contaminated the Danube at the time and shocked us all, and you know that I campaign strongly for the Danube region."
"For that reason, as a trade politician, I wonder what can we do about it?"
"In the European Union, we only have limited gold mining capacities."
"The goal is to make a difference worldwide with technical innovations."
"Here, there is high technology, I know."
"In Germany environmental technologies were developed that will help to avoid cyanide in the future."
"We must make these European high technologies commercially viable and we must make them affordable."
"I see great potential for trade in this."
"We should not confine ourselves to the European Union, but ensure that here, we also achieve a breakthrough in international trade, in the interests of the environment and our economy."
"(SK) Cyanide extraction techniques are associated with a high risk of environmental damage and therefore also pose a threat to human life and health."
"Cyanide leaching of precious metals such as gold is banned in a number of Member States, but the risks of a natural disaster involving contamination of surface waters goes beyond national boundaries."
"The notorious accident in Baia Mare (which is in Romania, and here I must correct my colleague, Mr Posselt: it did not originate from Czechoslovakia, but rather from Romania, and then it contaminated both Hungary and Slovakia, and thus the former Czechoslovakia) caused incalculable damage, even up to 1 000 km or more away from where it occurred."
"My own country was among those affected."
"Despite this, the law in many European countries still allows the use of such techniques."
"In the interests of protecting human health and the environment, and in view of the fact that cyanide extraction techniques can affect a number of states when accidents occur, I firmly believe that it is necessary and, indeed, essential to establish unified legislation at the European level."
"(RO) A chemical substance which has got out of control and escaped into the environment causes serious problems, but we have more than 10 million chemical substances."
"We also have an even higher number of sites where work is carried out using chemical substances."
"We could discuss here in the European Parliament millions of potentially dangerous scenarios."
"Cyanides are certainly toxic, but I am a chemist and I can tell you that we have a global problem: fewer than 18% of cyanides are used in mining."
"The remaining cyanides are used to produce medicines, consumer goods in the cosmetics industry, as well as in many other areas."
"However, substances are used on our planet which are thousands of times more toxic than cyanides."
"Generally speaking, if chemical substances enter water, they destroy life."
"We have many dead rivers around the world which have not been touched by cyanides."
"There is no sign of life in the Dead Sea because it contains a large amount of sodium chloride, in other words, table salt."
"When using any chemical substance, all the technologies and regulations for protecting the environment which apply in 2010 must be observed."
"As a European state, this is definitely the path which Romania has chosen to go down."
"Every country in the world must do the same."
"Mr President, with all due respect, can I say that this debate is largely misdirected."
"The subject before us is a very curious matter."
"It reignites an accident that took place 10 years ago."
"Why?"
"Why has there been this long silence?"
"And why now?"
"Why a debate now?"
"If we follow this pattern, we could and should ban anything and everything that can be linked to a past accident."
"I find the whole matter unjustified."
"I think it uses the environment as a screen and it is based on the mass fears so fashionable nowadays."
"In my opinion, and I think in truth, it is just a poor political plot."
"(DE) Mr President, I would briefly like to clarify as my fellow Member perhaps misunderstood as a result of the translation."
"I know Baia Mare very well and know that it is not in the former Czechoslovakia, but in the north of Transylvania."
"I know it really well."
"That was a translation error."
"I merely alluded to the speeches by Mr BÅezina, Mrs RoithovÃ¡ and Mr MÃ©szÃ¡ros that referred to experiences in KaÅ¡perskÃ© Hory or Bergreichenstein, etc. I am familiar with the geography of Central Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for this debate."
"I will, of course, make sure that Mr PotoÄnik gets a full account of it."
"We share your concerns about cyanide."
"It is, of course, a very dangerous toxin and we are aware of that."
"But let me assure you that the Commission has drawn conclusions from the terrible accident that happened 10 years ago in Baia Mare."
"The directive that we have very recently put in place includes a lot of limitations, requirements, restrictions and demands, in order to provide maximum protection as regards the effects on the environment and human health."
"The directive will also reduce the likelihood of such an accident happening again and, should there be an accident, will reduce the possible impact to a great extent."
"It is therefore extremely important that the directive is duly implemented."
"Given the very stringent requirements of the Mining Waste Directive and the absence of adequate alternatives today, a general ban on cyanide use for gold extraction does not, for the moment, seem appropriate."
"However we are following the issue, we are studying the latest technology development and there will be an evaluation in 2012."
"We must increase the recycling rates of the products containing precious metals in the EU, in order to reduce reliance on gold mining altogether."
"Thank you for this debate."
"Mr PotoÄnik will, of course, be at your disposal to answer further questions on this."
"The Commission is taking this very seriously."
"If you study the directive, you will see that many of your concerns are already there."
"Let us help to push the Member States to really implement it in full because that would considerably reduce the risks."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the May I part-session."
"I wish you a safe journey to your homes."
"Let us hope that it will not be interrupted by a volcano or anything or anybody else!"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"On 30 January 2000, the dam surrounding the tailing pond containing waste from the company Aurul in Baia Mare, Romania, cracked, allowing approximately 100 000 cubic metres of contaminated water, containing 100 tonnes of cyanide and heavy metals, to spill out."
"This spill resulted in the drinking water supply being cut off to 2.5 million people in three countries."
"The River Somes had cyanide concentrations 700 times above permitted levels."
"Aquatic life was completely destroyed over a distance of several hundred kilometres."
"We must not forget the details of this disaster, which has become synonymous internationally with pollution."
"It highlights to us that, in spite of legislation and controls, such accidents can occur at any time."
"Hazardous substances have no place in mining if we want to prevent disasters."
"The intention at RoÅia MontanÄ is to construct the largest surface gold mine in Europe, based on the use of cyanides."
"What will the consequences be then?"
"The destruction of the environment, the disappearance of the village, the displacement of the inhabitants, churches and cemeteries and a death warrant for the priceless remains dating back to Roman and pre-Roman times."
"History teaches us lessons."
"It is incumbent upon all of us to learn them."
"It is absolutely imperative that we impose a total ban on the use of cyanide in mining within the EU in order to avert tragedies affecting people and the environment."
"in writing. - (HU) During the past two years, I have voiced on several occasions, both in the plenary sessions of the European Parliament and in its various forums, the dangers of cyanide-based mining."
"In addition, I wrote a letter to Mr Stavros Dimas, Commissioner for the Environment, on the matter of the mining ventures in Romania (RoÅia MontanÄ) and Bulgaria (Chelopech and Krumovgrad)."
"The use of cyanide mining technologies is sometimes referred to as a dangerous 'chemical atomic bomb' because of its effect on the living environment."
"Since 1990, there have been some thirty cases worldwide of serious pollution caused by cyanide mining."
"The disaster on the Tisza River ten years ago is considered the most serious European environmental disaster since Chernobyl."
"Only in the past few days in Romania, the ArieÅ River, which flows into the Tisza, was polluted by a gold mine that had been shut down 40 years ago."
"Last year, when visiting a nearby mining company (RoÅia Poieni), President Traian BÄsescu himself stated that 'we cannot sit on such an ecological bomb, for this is simply murder'."
"In view of the new plans for mining development in Romania (RoÅia MontanÄ, Baia Mare, Certeju de Sus, etc.), I emphasise that a ban on cyanide-based mining is not simply a Romanian nor, in any way, an 'ethnic' problem, but a universal - European - matter, on which both the EU Member States and the European Parliament groups can reach a sensible agreement."
"Europe cannot be indifferent to the cyanide disasters of the past or the threat of new ones in the future."
"It is in the interest of us all to protect people and our environment, not only from radioactivity or air pollution, but also from cyanide poisoning."
"I ask that this honourable House vote for our initiative."

"I was pleased that the Council was represented, as the discharge process is one which concerns not only the EU institutions, but also the Member States, which the Council represents."
"The real meat of my report is the number of proposals that aim to reduce error rates, to pinpoint problems and to improve the matching of information from the Commission and from the Court of Auditors, allowing us all in future to identify and tackle the real problem areas in our expenditure."
"With the Lisbon Treaty in place, it is time for a review of the discharge process itself."
"My report calls for a higher-level debate involving the EU institutions and, of course, the Member States, which are responsible for managing around 80% of expenditure."
"Although my report is about the 2008 discharge, it contains many issues that are highly topical today."

"The text would read as follows: 'Is of the opinion that, within an efficient and effective corporate governance system, due attention must be paid to the role of management; takes the view that Directors-General, Directors and Heads of Unit should be selected on the basis of merit taking into account equal opportunities and geographical balance...'."
"So the oral amendment is to insert 'taking into account equal opportunities and geographical balance' after the word 'merit'."

"Î¤he next item is the vote."
"(For outcome of the vote and other details: see Minutes)"
"I have received a proposal for a change to today's vote: following yesterday's meeting between President Buzek and Prime Minister Zapatero, it was agreed that a dialogue should be started immediately at the highest institutional level on certain procedural aspects concerning discharge of the Council."
"As such, the Presidency proposes that the vote on this issue be postponed until the next part-session."
"Mr President, I, too, heard about the meeting between President Buzek and Mr Zapatero."
"I suppose that on this issue of the discharge of the Council, the points of controversy between us and the Council are of such a sensitive nature that it makes sense to hold further talks."
"What we would be deciding today, namely to postpone the discharge of the Council, has serious implications."
"For that reason, we discussed this once again this morning in our group and it was said that, if there is an opportunity for the open questions to be answered to Parliament's satisfaction, we ought to take that opportunity."
"It would perhaps also be a move towards the Council to create trust: trust not only with regard to the discharge, but in other areas, too, and therefore we are able to agree to this proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard Mr Schulz out."
"I am Vice-Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I was among the MEPs who attended the informal negotiations with the Council."
"The report to which the postponement relates obtained a 27-vote majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control, with 0 votes against and 0 abstentions, which means it was adopted unanimously."
"We have twice held informal negotiations with the Council to come to an agreement."
"The Council has consistently refused to enter into such an agreement."
"The only reason for possibly postponing the vote would be if the Council were to state its readiness right now to produce all the documents we require from it."
"The second problem is of a legislative nature."
"In accordance with our Rules of Procedure and the Financial Regulation, discharge must be granted before 15 May of year n + 2."
"We are talking about the 2008 budget, and so n + 2 = 15 May 2010."
"The next plenary sitting apart from tomorrow's is not until 17 May, so if we do not vote now we shall be in contravention of our own Financial Regulation, which I think would be a sign of extremely poor management."
"Mr President, I am now in my sixth year in the European Parliament, and although I do not want to lecture anyone, good manners dictate that on this key matter it is necessary to seek the opinion of the rapporteur."
"I would like to remind everybody that our Parliament has already granted discharge to the Council in this parliamentary term, only in November of last year - for the year 2007."
"We can say, therefore, that once again the Council has not presented the right documents."
"Personally, I am bewildered that, when looking at implementation of the budget for 2008, we received documents for 2007, and so absolutely not in accordance with our expectations and requirements."
"However, I am known as a man of compromise, and I would like to give the Council a certain chance, and, really, it might be the last chance for the Council to prepare all the right documents and abandon the unfortunate gentlemen's agreement of 1970, which de facto does not allow us, according to the Council, to supervise that institution."
"I am, therefore, in favour of making an exception and postponing the vote to give the Council a few more weeks - two or six - and then, in accordance with what Mr Staes has said, I will be in favour of an immediate vote, in June at the latest."
"Î¤he next item is the vote."
"(For outcome of the vote and other details: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"I support the stance adopted by the rapporteur from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on this dossier, along with the Commission's proposal on combating tax fraud in the European Union."
"I believe that this proposal can improve administrative cooperation on intra-Community transactions, when it comes to calculating value added tax and monitoring the correct application of this tax."
"It remains to be seen whether the Commission's proposal to extend the Eurocanet network and establish a new structure, Eurofisc, which would operate on a voluntary basis without having any legal capacity, will increase the success rate of the battle against tax fraud at EU level."
"Governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, European administrative cooperation on VAT needs to be improved, particularly in terms of combating tax evasion."
"The report drafted by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil supports this approach by backing the proposals of the European Commission that focus on facilitating the exchange of data between Member States."
"I voted in favour of the report because it also adds some substantial improvements to the European Commission's text, particularly concerning the data protection of individuals."
"Under the consultation procedure of the European Parliament, I voted for the report by my excellent Spanish colleague Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax."
"VAT fraud is often organised on a cross-border basis, which is why the European Union and its Member States need to be better coordinated to combat VAT fraud, in particular, and fiscal fraud, in general."
"I am pleased that the Commission's proposal lays down the principle of a legal basis for establishing a joint structure, Eurofisc, which will make possible multilateral, swift and targeted exchange of information so that Member States can respond adequately and in a coordinated fashion to combat any new kinds of fraud that emerge, drawing on jointly organised risk analysis."
"I share the rapporteur's concerns about the protection of personal data, which must be respected."
"This type of data must be used only with the goal of preventing and combating tax offences."
"I supported this report since I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the provisions in the area of the fight against fraud."
"Fraud with the aim of evading taxes has serious consequences for national budgets, violates the principle of fair taxation and may distort competition and have an impact on the functioning of the internal market."
"Current regulations do not effectively ensure cooperation between Member States, although fraud in the field of value added tax is often organised across several countries, and therefore Member States must cooperate to prevent it."
"It is encouraging that the new version of the Regulation will strengthen the Community's database of VAT payers and their operations, which will provide Member States with access to information, improve administrative cooperation and allow us to combat VAT fraud more effectively."
"I voted for a European strategy for combating tax fraud and evasion relating to VAT."
"I believe that a mechanism must be created at European level for combating fraud because the extent of this phenomenon highlights that the measures aimed at tackling this problem can no longer be managed exclusively at national level."
"The International VAT Association quotes estimates of VAT losses ranging from EUR 60 billion to EUR 100 billion per year across the European Union."
"This is why I am urging close cooperation between administrative authorities in Member States and the European Commission in order to avoid the detrimental consequences which tax fraud can have for national budgets, as well as for competition."
"Administrative cooperation between Member States in the fight against fraud and financial crime is extremely important for reasons of fairness and justice and because of the huge impact such crime has on a country's economic situation."
"Countless cases of fraud occur in the field of value added tax, so it is essential to have a legal framework with strong measures so as to bring about a substantial reduction in the number of such cases."
"Greater cooperation among central governments is desirable, through the sharing of information, so long as the privacy of the individual is respected, as well as complete databases and officials properly trained in detecting and processing such cases."
"The Member States need to implement the measures put forward by the European Union as quickly as possible, so as to create a more transparent system that can effectively combat fiscal fraud."
"Distortions caused by value added tax (VAT) fraud affect the overall balance of the own resource system, which must be fair and transparent in order to guarantee the smooth operation of the Union."
"Since the public authorities have an obligation to compensate for the loss of revenue involved, an increase in fraud translates into greater fiscal pressure on companies which abide by tax rules."
"Although investigations into the magnitude of VAT evasion and fraud have not been carried out in all Member States, the International VAT Association estimates that VAT losses range from EUR 60 billion to EUR 100 billion per year across the European Union."
"Greater cooperation between central administrations is desirable, by sharing information with respect for individual privacy."
"The Member States need to implement the measures put forward by the European Union as quickly as possible, so as to create a more transparent system that can effectively combat fiscal fraud."
"The fight against tax fraud must be a priority for the EU, specifically in the area of value added tax."
"It is from this perspective that a cross-sectoral policy to fight fraud in all Member States is being advocated, notably including information exchanges."
"It is particularly significant that fraud is one of the main causes of injustice within the EU, since it leads to unfair competition and an unbalanced market."
"I voted for the Council's draft regulation on administrative cooperation and combating tax evasion in the field of value added tax, because this legal act will make it possible for the Member States to fight jointly and more efficiently against cross-border tax evasion."
"Tax evasion has serious consequences for the budgets of the Member States; it violates principles of equality in taxation and brings about distortions of competition."
"Although the measures to combat tax evasion are largely only within the competence of the Member States, I think that taking measures against tax evasion in today's global world needs to be a priority for the EU as well."
"The Commission's proposal offers Member States the means to combat cross-border VAT fraud effectively by supplementing and amending the current regulation, and creating a legal basis for targeted cooperation in order to combat fraud: Eurofisc."
"Tax fraud has serious consequences for national budgets, leads to violations of the principle of fair taxation and is liable to bring about distortions of competition."
"Neither should we forget that public authorities have an obligation to compensate for the loss of revenue involved by putting greater fiscal pressure on companies which abide by tax rules."
"The fight against tax fraud across the EU must complement the action of the Member States."
"The draft regulation aims not only to allow VAT to be calculated correctly, but also to monitor its correct application, particularly with regard to intra-Community transactions, and combat VAT fraud."
"In general terms, several improvements are introduced relating to the exchange of information, namely, an improved definition of the cases in which Member States may carry out an administrative investigation, including measures to remedy the failure to carry out an investigation."
"I am pleased that the financial impact of irregularities, as far as they have been identified, fell from EUR 1 024 million in 2007 to EUR 783.2 million in 2008, with reductions being recorded in all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds."
"I fully support the work done by the Commission, and I would point out that the fight against fraud and corruption is an important duty of the European institutions and all Member States."
"In view of the particular economic situation afflicting all of Europe, I agree that it is necessary to protect the Union's financial interests and to fight organised crime, which, according to national indicators, is increasing its capacity for collusion within institutions, particularly by means of fraud against the Community budget."
"I therefore think it essential to enact effective legislation to improve administrative cooperation in tackling harmful tax practices and ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"In this connection, I support the proposal for a Council directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, while stressing the importance of making Member States more accountable, starting with the quality of the information entered into the databases."
"The Commission's proposal to simplify, modernise and harmonise the rules on VAT invoices offers improvements, particularly concerning the provisions enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to use simplified invoices, as well as the guarantee of acceptance by the tax authorities of electronic invoices under the same conditions as conventional ones."
"In this respect, the rapporteur's proposal to grant tax authorities the option to prescribe additional requirements, such as sequential numbers for simplified invoices, provides a simple security measure which preserves the improvements made by the Commission."
"In this area concerning the common VAT system and the rules on invoicing, the Commission must support Member States which require technical assistance to modernise their e-administration, whether via the Community programme Fiscalis 2013 or through the use of the Structural Funds."
"I believe that the rapporteur has made amendments which improve the Commission's proposal; hence the reason I voted to adopt this report."
"I voted in favour of Mr Casa's report concerning the rules for VAT invoicing."
"On this subject, a Council directive of 2001 had laid down common rules at European Union level as a means of simplifying, modernising and harmonising VAT invoicing rules."
"There are disparities, however, with the rules in the different Member States, particularly as far as e-invoicing is concerned."
"Such disparities, nonetheless, are an impediment to the mainstreaming of this kind of invoicing, despite it being a source of simplification."
"The greater harmonisation of the rules proposed by the European Commission and supported by the rapporteur is therefore good news for all European businesses, as e-invoicing will be more accessible to them and, in turn, their administrative burden will be reduced."
"Under the consultation procedure of the European Parliament, I voted for the report by my excellent Maltese colleague Mr Casa on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax as regards the rules on invoicing."
"It was becoming essential to do away with the administrative set-up linked to invoicing."
"Historically, the opportunities afforded to Member States in this area have involved disparate rules, in particular in the field of e-invoicing."
"Such rules are an obstacle to the smooth functioning of enterprises - especially those using new dematerialisation technologies - on the internal market at a time when unnecessary administrative burdens in Europe are curbing economic growth."
"I support all the simplification measures proposed in the report, especially those intended for SMEs and in particular: to delete the requirement to hold an invoice that complies with formalities of all the Member States; to confirm that paper and electronic invoices are equally valid; and to delete the possibility for Member States in which the tax is due to require particular invoices to be translated into their official languages."
"I welcome the adoption of this report in numerous respects."
"However, particularly as a rapporteur and author of some key amendments, I would only like to refer to the most important aspects, both of which specifically result in reducing the administrative burdens on businesses."
"The first of these is the obligation on Member States to implement the accounting system based on receipts and payments (cash accounting) for SMEs (which are defined at EU level as firms with a turnover of less than EUR 2 million), which will be a welcome incentive for the business sector."
"This is being introduced at a time when businesses are currently in the situation where they pay VAT on an invoice as soon as it is issued, but the relevant invoice payment (and associated VAT) may only be paid months later, if ever."
"However, in every case, the fundamental principle remains that the deductibility of VAT is inextricably linked to its payment."
"The second aspect is that electronic invoices are granted the same legal status as paper invoices so that invoices sent via email will probably replace the current paper invoices, thereby facilitating the tasks of not only issuing and sending invoices, but of managing and storing them as well."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Casa, on the important work he has carried out so far."
"My parliamentary group has always been committed to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the real driving force of Europe's economy and which we as politicians have the duty to boost."
"In particular, I endorse the possibility, proposed by the Commission, to allow the supplier to pay VAT only when he receives payment for a supply."
"I also agree with the principle regarding the possibility of giving equal validity to electronic invoices and paper invoices."
"This, then, is a series of measures which, in my view, fall within a broader process to cut red tape which is helpful for European enterprises, especially at such a critical economic juncture."
"I therefore hope that these measures will be adopted as soon as possible within a broader support framework for small and medium-sized enterprises, which need to operate in an easier economic and fiscal environment."
"in writing. - This was my own report on the VAT rules on invoicing."
"We were successful in asking that the cash accounting scheme be introduced on a mandatory basis in all Member States, thereby giving SMEs the option of whether or not to use such a scheme."
"The report has also been successful in reducing unnecessary burdens on business that were found within the Commission's proposal."
"To this end the report was successful in achieving its aims and I have voted in favour."
"Greater internal market integration and the cutting of unjustifiable costs to companies through a process of simplification and of bringing down administrative barriers are objectives that must be borne in mind in the preparation of Union legislation."
"This directive, which aims at establishing a common system of invoicing with regard to value added tax, is therefore essential for achieving those aims."
"In particular, I believe the traditional invoicing method should be replaced with electronic invoicing, which is quicker and less costly for companies and individuals, provided that the principle of transparency is respected."
"The directive under discussion aims to establish a common system of invoicing for value added tax through an exercise of simplification and reduction of the administrative burden; this is essential to achieving greater integration of the internal market and reducing unjustified costs for companies."
"I believe that this directive constitutes a positive step towards bringing clarity and legal certainty both for taxable persons and for the administrations, whilst providing additional means to fight against value added tax fraud."
"A common system of value added tax (VAT) as regards the rules on invoicing is essential to the simplification, modernisation and harmonisation of the rules on VAT invoicing."
"This new system also brings companies a significant saving, which is of the utmost importance in this context of crisis."
"The adoption of this report is also another step in the fight against fraud and tax evasion."
"As a liberal, I voted for the directive changing the rules on invoicing, because I think that the method used today, whereby this chapter was incorporated into the VAT Directive, has not completely attained its objective, which was to simplify, modernise and harmonise the submission of VAT invoices."
"I think that the new rules will reduce the burden of bureaucracy on the entrepreneur, and also ensure that the same rules for drawing up and issuing invoices will start to apply in all Member States."
"Given the open market and the movement of services, nothing else would be reasonable."
"On the basis of the recommendation made to us in the report by my Polish fellow Member, Mr Czarnecki, I voted in favour of granting the Court of Justice's Registrar discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008."
"I endorse the request by the Court of Auditors that enhanced procurement procedures be established by the European Court of Justice."
"I am pleased with the smooth functioning of the ECJ."
"Nevertheless, I cannot understand the reluctance of the ECJ to publish its members' declarations of financial interests, and I support the request made by Parliament to implement this practice without delay."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the budgetary situation of the European Court of Justice (ECJ)."
"It points out a number of important issues that should be urgently reviewed, such as the need to enhance procurement procedures, in order to help authorising services organise tendering procedures and control adherence to regulatory obligations."
"I welcome the fact that the ECJ has adopted the practice of including in its activity report a chapter outlining the follow-up during the year to Parliament's previous discharge decisions and to reports of the Court of Auditors."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the Court of Justice."
"On the basis of the recommendation made in the report by my Polish fellow Member, Mr Czarnecki, I voted in favour of granting the Secretary-General of the European Court of Auditors discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008."
"Like many of my fellow MEPs, I am delighted with the proper functioning of the Court and its sound financial management."
"I regret that the declarations of financial interests of the Members of the Court that the latter submit to the President of the Court in accordance with its Code of Conduct are not made public or, at the very least, communicated to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"I am glad to see that an external firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has audited the accounts of the Court of Auditors and concluded that 'nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that, in all material respects and based on (identified) criteria, (a) the resources assigned to the Court have not been used for their intended purposes, and (b) the control procedures in place do not provide the necessary guarantees to ensure the compliance of financial operations with the applicable rules and regulations'."
"I also welcome the fact that the Court of Auditors has included a chapter giving an account of the follow-up during the year to Parliament's previous discharge decisions."
"As the body largely responsible for auditing European institutions, the Court of Auditors also has its turn to be audited."
"It is clear that the audit carried out by an outside entity - PricewaterhouseCoopers - has shown itself to be very positive."
"The internal auditor's report was also positive, with the majority of its recommendations having been accepted and applied in advance under several action plans."
"On the basis of the recommendation made in the report by my Polish fellow Member, Mr Czarnecki, I voted in favour of granting the European Ombudsman discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2008."
"I welcome the decision by the Ombudsman, Mr Diamandouros, to publish his annual declaration of interests and to put it on his website."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the Ombudsman."
"It noted, however, that certain aspects of the public procurement process could be improved."
"I join the rapporteur in warmly welcoming the Ombudsman's decision to publish his annual declaration of interests and to make it available on the Internet."
"I agree with the rapporteur in urging the Ombudsman to include in his next activity report (for the 2009 financial year) a chapter giving a detailed account of the follow-up during the year to Parliament's earlier discharge decisions."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the European Ombudsman."
"On the basis of the recommendation made to the European Parliament in the report by my Polish fellow Member, Mr Czarnecki, I voted in favour of granting the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2008."
"I welcome the annual publication of declarations of financial interests of the elected members of that institution (European Data Protection Supervisor and Assistant Supervisor)."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how public funds have been used."
"I join the rapporteur in the positive assessment he made of the efforts to consolidate the management of financial and human resources, as well as the improvement in functionality and efficiency of internal control functions achieved in 2008."
"I also welcome the annual publication of declarations of financial interests of the elected members of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), containing relevant information on remunerated posts or activities and declarable professional activities."
"That is essential for building people's trust in public office holders."
"I agree with the rapporteur in urging the EDPS to include in its next activity report (for the 2009 financial year) a chapter giving a detailed account of the follow-up during the year to Parliament's earlier discharge decisions."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"On the basis of the recommendation made to the European Parliament in the report by my excellent colleague and friend, Mrs Mathieu, I voted in favour of granting the Director of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2008."
"I cannot understand why this body is accumulating seemingly unnecessary surpluses, for example a surplus of nearly EUR 27 million in 2008 and accumulated funds on 31 December 2008 of nearly EUR 50 million."
"I am surprised that the pensions dispute has not been resolved."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors states that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"In respect of the Centre's activities, the Court of Auditors found that there was a certain lack of precision in the forecasts for translation requests received, which led the Centre to have an accumulated budget surplus contrary to Regulation (EC) No 2965/94."
"This situation must, therefore, be remedied."
"I, like the rapporteur, find it regrettable that the conflict between the Centre and the Commission as to the employer's share of pension contributions for staff has still not been settled."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"That means that the Centre has made enormous progress with regard to the inventory procedure for identifying, recording and capitalising assets, to documentation on internal control processes and to procurement procedures."
"There has, however, been a standstill in the area of staff management, given that the objectives for staff and the performance indicators were neither measurable nor focused on results."
"Nevertheless, like the rapporteur, I welcome the Centre's intention to introduce a pilot system in 2010 for recording the time spent working by each staff member."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I am concerned by the observation made by the Court of Auditors that the Agency does not draw up a multiannual work programme, which is essential for effective financial management and clear target setting."
"The Administrative Board should therefore be congratulated on its decision to begin to develop this kind of programme."
"Such a programme will be essential for improving the Agency's budgetary and financial management."
"Although the Court approved this management, it still has some shortcomings that need to be addressed."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe an important tool to introduce will be an effective means of managing staff members' working time, by strictly setting the number of recommended hours for each project."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the Community Fisheries Control Agency."
"On the basis of the recommendation made to the European Parliament in the report by my excellent colleague and friend, Mrs Mathieu, I voted in favour of granting the Director of the European Agency for Reconstruction discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for 2008."
"I believe that it would be useful for the Commission, following the memorandum of understanding of December 2008 between the Commission and the Agency providing for certain closing transactions and in particular for the Agency's residual assets to become the property of the Commission after 31 December 2008, to produce a detailed closure report on the closing transactions for both the social and the financial aspects."
"I support the calls for clarification on the funding allocated to Kosovo, since the credibility of the Union and of this young nation, which one day intends to become an EU Member State, is at stake."
"I believe it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"I must highlight the fact that the Court of Auditors found that none of the formal conditions required for the award of a direct grant of EUR 1 399 132 (0.31% of the available operational budget) to an international organisation had been fulfilled."
"Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the efficiently functioning European Agency for Reconstruction has been wound up and the management of the funding has been transferred to the delegations;"
"I demand that the Commission submit a report detailing how many staff the delegations have taken on to cope with the Agency's tasks; and I call on the Commission to supply comprehensive and complete information on whether budget support has been provided from the funds transferred from the Agency to the delegations."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"I argue that it is essential for civil servants to be accountable to the general public."
"Therefore, they must objectively and rigorously account for how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors stated in its report that the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"There had been marked progress over the previous years, and an effort had been made to implement measures suggested in the past by both the Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service."
"As the rapporteur points out, however, the mechanisms for setting the Agency's objectives need to be strengthened in order to make it easier to evaluate their attainment, and a new methodology for staff management, from recruitment to performance evaluation, should be introduced."

"The Court of Auditors states that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"It should be highlighted that the Centre has consolidated its public health functions, enhanced the capacities of its disease-specific programmes, further developed partnerships and improved its managerial structures."
"I deplore the fact, however, that the Centre has not comprehensively fulfilled its obligation to send to the authority responsible for discharge a report drawn up by its Director summarising the number of internal audits conducted by the internal auditor."

"The Court of Auditors states that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"The Agency is performing a role that the Commission is not in a position to take on; it is fully aligned with the Union's strategic priorities and its activities are complementary to those of other agencies."
"It should be noted that the Court of Auditors highlights delays in the operational activities caused by difficulties in implementing the IT system and by a lack of qualified staff."

"The Court of Auditors believes in its report that the annual accounts of the European Environment Agency for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"I congratulate the Agency on the external evaluation of the EU decentralised agencies commissioned by the Commission in 2009, the main findings of which were very positive."
"In particular, I congratulate it on having built up a well-developed activity-based management system, a multiannual work programme, a balanced scorecard with indicators, and an integrated management control system, all of which contribute to efficient management."

"The Court of Auditors in its report describes the annual accounts of the European Food Safety Authority for the financial year 2008 as reliable and the underlying transactions as legal and regular."
"The Authority reached a high level of budget execution for both commitment and payment credits (97% and 95% respectively)."
"Nonetheless, it should be noted that some inadequacies that had been identified previously by the Court of Auditors remain and are becoming recurrent, namely carry-overs of appropriations to the following year and cancellation of commitments for operational activities carried over from the previous year."
"This situation is at odds with the principle of annuality and shows weaknesses in programming and budgeting, which must be remedied."
"It is a highly positive development, however, that the Authority has succeeded in substantially and consistently improving its performance indicators in recent years."

"The Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"Like the rapporteur, I advocate that the Centre should explicitly set the proposed objectives in its annual work programme, to make the annual evaluation of its performance easier."
"It should also include human resources management procedures to make such management more effective, for example by introducing objectives of working hours for its agents into its programming and setting the average time they should devote to each project."

"I join the rapporteur in congratulating the Agency on having put in place sophisticated activity-based budgeting and user-satisfaction monitoring."
"The Agency must, however, improve the quality of its procurement procedures so as to put an end to the shortcomings identified by the Court of Auditors (for instance, as regards the application of evaluation methods for the price criteria and as regards the essential need for justifications for the choice of procedures)."

"The Court of Auditors has expressed its opinion that there is evidence that the annual accounts of the European Maritime Safety Agency are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, the Agency failed to prepare a multiannual work programme, and its annual work programme was not related to its commitment budget."
"The Agency is, however, finalising a five-year strategy and developing Key Performance Indicators, which will have to be submitted to Parliament for scrutiny."
"The report also points out that the procedures for establishing the budget were not rigorous enough, leading to a high number of budgetary transfers and a high level of cancellation of payment appropriations, indicating weaknesses in planning and monitoring."
"This may have been a one-off event, however, due to the move to the Agency's long-term office building."

"The Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, it highlights failings in procurement procedures, particularly with regard to the under-estimation of the budgets of framework contracts, which ultimately constitutes an obstacle to fair competition."
"These deficiencies must therefore be overcome."
"Given the importance of electronic communication networks, the Agency should be congratulated on the improvement in the resilience of European electronic communication networks, and on the development and maintenance of cooperation with Member States."

"However, the Court of Auditors points out that the Agency has weaknesses in the setting of objectives and performance measures, as well as problems in procurement procedures."
"Given the greater scrutiny of the activities of public bodies, the Agency needs to adopt appropriate measures to overcome these problems."
"Finally, I congratulate the Agency on having implemented 32 of the 36 recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service since 2006."
"Amongst the four recommendations which are still in progress, however, one is critical and three are very important, and I urge the Agency, therefore, to implement certain internal control standards relating to bank signatures, segregation of duties, sensitive posts and maintenance of delegation powers, as mentioned in those recommendations."

"The Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"However, it warns that there are irregularities and a lack of transparency in recruitment procedures, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has even opened an inquiry into the Foundation."
"It should be noted, however, that the Foundation says that it has undertaken a thorough review of its recruitment procedures in response to the Court of Auditors' findings, although we have not yet been informed about it."
"Lastly, it is important to highlight that the Foundation's work in supporting the Commission in 2008 obtained a 97% satisfaction rate from the Commission."

"The Agency has significantly improved its financial management over the last three years, which is very welcome, and it should continue to strive for the highest standards in budgetary planning, implementation and control."
"However, there remain a few irregularities, particularly in relation to procurement procedures, which need to be resolved."

"The Court of Auditors states that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Euratom Supply Agency are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"It should be noted that in 2008 the Agency did not receive any subsidy to cover its operations and the Commission bore all expenses incurred by the Agency for the implementation of the 2008 budget."
"It should also be noted that the commitments carried over from the financial year 2007 were paid with the unused part of the 2007 subsidy."
"To all effects, therefore, in the absence of an autonomous budget, the Agency is de facto integrated in the Commission."
"That may raise questions regarding its structure and autonomy, which can be examined in the future."

"After weaknesses were detected in recruitment and procurement procedures in the previous year, the Court of Auditors states in its report that the annual accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"That represents an improvement in the management of the Foundation's accounts and internal audit systems, which is very welcome."
"Given the importance of this agency, I hope it will continue its efforts at budgetary discipline, improve its human resources management procedures and enter staff numbers, including contract staff, in the activity report in a transparent manner."

"Despite the Court of Auditors' opinion that the accounts of the European Judicial Cooperation Unit (Eurojust) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I am concerned at the rapporteur's evaluation that 'the lack of indicators, the deficits in measurement of user satisfaction and the lack of coordination between the budget and the work programme make it difficult to evaluate Eurojust's performance'."
"I also note the Court of Auditors' finding that in 2008 Eurojust had a problem as regards carrying forward appropriations, although the amount was lower than in the previous year, and action is needed to prevent this situation from recurring in future."
"Lastly, I share the rapporteur's concern that none of the 26 recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service have been fully implemented by Eurojust."

"We note that the Agency's budget has increased substantially in the last three years, and grew by 69% in 2008."
"The Court of Auditors, however, has consistently found several weaknesses, in particular: (i) a high level of carry-overs and cancellations (with 49%, nearly 69% and 55% of the appropriations available in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively not spent); (ii) legal commitments entered into before the corresponding budgetary commitments; and (iii) recruitment procedures that depart from the rules, in particular as regards the transparency and non-discriminatory nature of the procedures in question."

"The Court of Auditors in its report describes the annual accounts of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy for the financial year 2008 as reliable and the underlying transactions as legal and regular."
"It should be noted that the Court of Auditors identified a surplus of EUR 57 600 000 in the budget outturn account, which represents 38% of the accrued revenue, and part of that surplus was carried over to the 2009 financial year."
"That may have stemmed from the fact that the Joint Undertaking was in a start-up phase and had not fully set up its internal control and financial information systems during the 2008 financial year."

"The Court of Auditors states that it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular."
"Like the rapporteur, however, I cannot fail to point out that the final budget adopted by the Administrative Board in April 2008 proved to be highly unrealistic, as is illustrated by commitment and payment appropriations take-up rates of 1% and 17% respectively."
"I would also highlight the fact that there were weaknesses in transaction controls and no adequate internal controls for contracts and procurement."
"I consider it essential for SESAR to take appropriate action to resolve the problems identified now during the next financial year."

"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on transportable pressure equipment, which would repeal the existing directive and a number of other related directives."
"Since some technical provisions of the existing directive conflict with international rules on the transport of dangerous goods, it is essential to remove the inconsistencies and to bring the technical requirements into line with international rules."
"The transport of pressure equipment, such as tanks, receptacles and cylinders, is presently governed by Directive 1999/36/EC, which lays down safety requirements for transport by road and by rail."
"Furthermore, the directive establishes common norms for the design, construction and subsequent checks of this kind of equipment."
"These rules, however, are in breach of international rules on the transport of dangerous goods, which is why the Commission has put forward a proposal for a revised directive."
"The proposal does not entail any substantial changes to the existing regulatory framework as regards the scope and the main provisions."
"It merely aims at removing the above-mentioned inconsistencies by bringing technical requirements on the transport of dangerous goods into line with the international rules in force."
"I therefore share the rapporteur's opinion that, in the absence of a horizontal solution between the institutions regarding the wording of the new comitology provisions, the dossier must be concluded as quickly as possible with an agreement at first reading."
"The transport of pressure equipment, such as tanks, receptacles and cylinders, is presently governed by Directive 1999/36/EC."
"The directive ensures the free movement of such equipment within the Union, including its placing on the market, by establishing common norms for the design, construction and subsequent checks."
"However, some technical provisions of the existing directive conflict with international rules on the transport of dangerous goods."
"The Commission has therefore put forward a proposal for a revised directive, which would repeal the existing directive on transportable pressure equipment and a number of other related directives."
"For the above reasons, I voted for this resolution, in which the committee is invited to adopt the report without additional amendments and mandate the rapporteur to enter into negotiations with the Council on this basis."
"The growing concern with issues relating to the environment and its protection leads us to take extra care with the safety rules relating to the transport of pressure equipment."
"The purpose of this directive is to reinforce safety and ensure the free movement of such equipment within the Union, by setting out clear, transparent and mandatory rules for safely transporting pressure equipment in all the Member States, standardising the procedures throughout the EU."
"The key objective of this directive is to remove the existing inconsistencies in previous legislation by bringing the technical requirements into line with international regulations on the transport of dangerous goods."
"Furthermore, the proposal aims to simplify and streamline certain provisions, in particular those relating to conformity assessment procedures."
"The proposal also incorporates provisions concerning equipment for transport operations in the internal market, thereby creating a general framework for marketing products on the single European market."
"I voted for this report as I believe that the proposal will, once it has been adopted, ensure a high level of safety for transportable pressure equipment and its users."
"Its proper implementation at Member State level will also provide increased protection for the environment and citizens' health."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Simpson report on transportable pressure equipment, even though our amendment was not adopted."
"Airport security and the transparency of consumer charges, in order to raise their standards and levels: these are the themes dealt with by the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on aviation security charges."
"Current systems for covering costs relating to aviation security, regulated at a national level, are not always clear for end users, who are often not even consulted before charges are calculated or changes are made to a charging system that affects them."
"Amongst other proposals, the report suggests including passenger and consumer protection associations in consultations between the security management body and the airlines, in order to ensure that the costs of security measures are correctly determined, and to check them against the price of the air ticket paid by the end user."
"I welcome another point of the report: the call for the directive to be implemented only by airports in Member States that effectively impose charges for security measures, and not those where this kind of measure has not been introduced."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report."
"Events in recent weeks have shown that airport security is a very important task for Member States and that we must take all essential precautionary measures."
"Each individual Member State decides on the methods for financing and applying aviation security."
"It is very important that the Directive sets out basic principles and procedures applicable to the body responsible for security and the airlines."
"Although legal requirements for airport regulation strongly differ in various Member States, a reasonable amount of information must nevertheless be provided by the operator to the air carriers so as to make the consultation process between airports and air carriers meaningful."
"To this end, the Directive establishes which information should be provided on a regular basis by the airport managing body."
"Air carriers should, in turn, give information as to their traffic forecasts, their intended fleet use and their present and future specific requirements at the airport, so as to allow the airport managing body to employ its capital and dedicate its capacity in an optimal manner."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have abstained from the vote on this proposal, as they believe, firstly, that this is unnecessary legislation because the requisite legislation is already in place in this area."
"Secondly, we believe that it is not the EU's job to order Member States to pay any additional costs for airport security."
"The issue of financing security charges should be entrusted to the individual Member States."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on aviation security charges."
"This proposal is highly important in upholding and protecting consumer and passenger rights, since it establishes a number of basic principles to be respected by airport operators when determining their security charges."
"These are: non-discrimination, consultation and remedy, transparency and cost-relatedness of security charges, and establishment of a supervisory authority."
"The European Commission has submitted a proposal establishing basic principles to be respected by airport operators when determining their security charges: (i) non-discrimination; (ii) consultation and remedy; (iii) transparency and cost-relatedness of security charges; and (iv) establishment of a supervisory authority."
"The main question arising in this respect is that of the financing of the stricter security measures that should be implemented."
"Parliament has more than once called for regulation of the financing of security charges, but without success."
"The rapporteur argues very well that the financing of these stricter measures should not be borne solely by the passengers (through externalisation of the costs), but should be financed by the Member States, which ultimately bear responsibility for the safety of their airports."
"Lastly, I would point out that one can never invest too much in airport and passenger security, as was clearly shown by the latest attempted terrorist attacks against civil aviation, which were luckily foiled."
"The European Parliament has demanded - several times and in vain - the regulation of security-charge financing to achieve greater transparency, as well as for security taxes and charges to be related to their real purposes."
"Parliament believes that the Member States should foot the bill for implementing stricter measures."
"The terrorist incident a few weeks ago has again shown that airport security is the responsibility of the Member States and that the purpose of existing and newly envisaged security measures is to prevent acts of terrorism."
"However, one point that has not so far been raised in the debate on the matter is the fact that it is ultimately passengers who foot the bill for such measures."
"I agree with the amendments introduced by this resolution, which will make it possible to prevent unnecessary parallel proceedings and administrative costs in this area."
"in writing. - We must ensure that airport security charges are transparent, objective and based on clear criteria that reflect real costs."
"Any new costs to air travel should acknowledge the importance airports have for the development of regions, especially those which depend heavily on tourism, as well as those that suffer geographical and natural handicaps, such as the outermost regions and islands."
"Airport users, as well as local authorities, should be able to obtain in a timely manner information on how and on what basis the charges are calculated."
"There should be also a compulsory procedure for consultations between the airport authorities and interested parties or local authorities, whenever there is a need for a revision of the charges."
"Also, any independent supervisory authority should have precise, clearly defined terms of reference, including in particular any powers they may have to take punitive action."
"I consider it unacceptable that the Member States are not guaranteeing funding for airport security measures that are not provided for in European legislation, and that moreover they are passing the costs on to the airlines, which then make passengers pay."
"I think it was necessary to go further than the regulation of 2008 and to adopt legislation to ensure that passengers do not bear these additional costs, which may at times prove to be completely unrelated to security charges."
"That is why I supported the report by my Austrian colleague, Mr Leichtfried, which guarantees greater transparency for citizens as well as airlines, and forces Member States to provide public funding for security measures that go beyond European requirements, since that falls under the national security of each Member State."
"In the event that the Commission presents a proposal to include body scanners on the list of European methods in order to stop the Member States from funding them, I will again support my colleague and will vote against this proposal, if necessary."
"The ever greater care taken over security in our airports has brought progressively more costs, for which passengers have been footing the bill."
"The additional costs of stricter security measures must be borne by the Member States, as they exist to prevent terrorist acts; however, they are being borne by passengers."
"We voted for this report because of our opposition to this situation."
"The costs of a task that is to be undertaken by the state, namely the maintenance of public safety, cannot simply be passed on like this."
"We need to decide what costs passengers can reasonably be expected to pay in respect of the ever more restrictive anti-terror security regulations."
"Only if countries themselves have to take financial responsibility for the strict security measures which have been prescribed, and are also able to make their own decisions with regard to these measures, can we prevent the possibility of an unrestrained increase in body scanners and other similar measures."
"The only people to profit from the hysteria surrounding terrorism and the uncontrolled competition to become better equipped will be innovative US companies."
"For these reasons, this proposal is to be welcomed."
"in writing. - I voted YES to the report."
"The important thing for us, however, has been that our two aims of 'linking costs for security screening and scanning with liberalised groundhandling services' and 'intermodal fair treatment of financing security measures' were both rejected by the EPP and ALDE (RCV)."
"Parliament had repeatedly called for the Commission to regulate the financing of security charges in the aviation sector."
"Its position has always been to call for greater transparency and for security taxes and charges to be related to their real purposes, believing that the Member States should foot the bill for implementing stricter measures."
"The Commission proposal does not address this issue."
"It only seeks a new economic impact assessment with a view to restricting costs, based on the principles of non-discrimination, consultation and remedy, and transparency of the charges."
"The present document, however, proposes that, where stricter measures result in additional costs, they should be financed by the Member State."
"I stress the importance of security measures at airports, and I am voting in favour of this initiative by Parliament."
"The proposal, to be implemented in all commercial airports in the European Union, is intrinsically linked to concerns over the right to information, to passenger non-discrimination and to consumer protection."
"I believe that the objectives of greater transparency and avoidance of unnecessary costs can only be achieved through the harmonisation of legislations and the clarification of responsibility between airlines and Member States in the adoption of security measures."
"I was pleased to hear the results of today's vote."
"I think that during work on this document we managed to develop an unequivocal and ambitious position, especially in relation to financing."
"I would like to stress again: terrorist attacks are not directed against airlines, they are directed against states."
"It is the state which is the guarantor of its citizens' security, and it must meet this obligation."
"The outcome of today's vote - 613 votes to 7 - is a very clear signal to the Council."
"This testifies to the great determination of the European Parliament on the question of the obligations of all Member States to bear at least part of the costs of air traffic security."
"I voted for the report on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network because its aim is to construct and modernise railway infrastructures, ports, waterways and airports."
"The priority projects envisaged also include the Curtici-BraÅov railway line."
"I welcome the setting up of a committee to support the Commission in implementing this decision and drafting the guidelines stipulated by it."
"I voted resolutely in favour of this text."
"Although it contributes only technical modifications, it reminds us of the importance of a European transport network in order to bring EU citizens closer together and to encourage mobility."
"Such mobility is essential since we cannot have a proper Europe without getting to know our neighbours, their countries and their culture."
"The trans-European transport network also contributes to the plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by introducing better management of modes of transport and promoting their interoperability."
"The text in question is a Commission proposal that is no more than a codification of earlier acts and regulations."
"It also introduces some minor modifications."
"Therefore, in line with the rapporteur's proposal and having noted the legal and political safeguards, I support adoption of the text, including the minor modifications and corrections proposed by the Council, as well as the conclusion of the file through an agreement at first reading."
"In technical terms, this proposal is one to codify the legal text."
"However, the Commission was obliged to recast it, since the annex has been slightly amended."
"I voted for the adoption of these amendments."
"I condemn the fact that the outermost regions do not always play an integral part in the global trans-European transport network, despite the fundamental importance for economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"It is inconceivable that the ORs are not involved in the planning of the network and do not appear on several trans-European transport network maps."
"The global network, the motorways of the sea and priority projects should be extended to all ORs without discrimination."
"The TEN-T policy should also incorporate network industries and services of general economic interest; it should not be limited merely to major streams of cargo traffic and passengers."
"The request for equal treatment for the outermost regions must be heard."
"How can we contemplate being left out of trans-European networks when European transport policy is vital to opening up our regions and for the freedom of movement within the internal market?"
"While the European Union sells off our sugar, banana and rum production to other countries by means of trade treaties with one hand, it simultaneously keeps us out of intra-European commercial routes with the other."
"These hands have a stranglehold on us, which we deplore."
"During the plenary session I voted for the report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network."
"It was a technical proposal, as preparations are being made to carry out the proper revision of the guidelines. It is estimated that they will be finalised by the end of next year."
"I think that this offers an absolutely crucial opportunity to reaffirm the important role played by transport policy at European level in the current context with the debate on the Europe 2020 objectives going on."
"Member States in general and Romania in particular, a country which is still in need of investment in its transport infrastructure, must be aware that this transport policy is being redrafted to meet the new challenges."
"An ageing population and the specific mobility requirements of the elderly, social migration and climate change are only some of the factors which impose the need to devise a suitable transport policy."
"At the same time, the drafting during this period of the EU's Danube Strategy provides the perfect framework for ensuring that maximum use is made of river transport on the EU's inland waterways."
"Amendments to and redefinitions of the development of the trans-European transport network have been going on for years."
"An effective trans-European transport network is essential to the existence of a healthy internal market, and contributes to the reinforcement of economic and social cohesion."
"The phenomenon of the Icelandic volcano showed us unequivocally that a trans-European transport network is needed; one that is effective and can give a coordinated response to the problems that emerge in these situations."
"This decision is important because it gives guidelines on the objectives, the priorities and the major actions to be taken in the area of the trans-European transport network."
"The EU has confirmed the importance of the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor by giving priority status to the northern arm from GdaÅsk to the Czech Republic and declaring its commitment to the Brenner Base Tunnel project."
"It is even more important to develop the southern part of the corridor via the Austrian Southern Railway to Italy."
"In this network in particular, which carries approximately half of all goods and passengers, we need to neutralise a dangerous eye-of-the-needle situation."
"Support from the EU for the Koralm project is essential on account of the existing bottlenecks in this region on the rail routes for freight transport; which, after all, the EU is always championing."
"With the Koralm Tunnel, the EU has a unique opportunity to shift traffic to the railways on a scale that we have been striving for for decades."
"As the development of the trans-European network may be crucial for Europe's competitiveness and the amendments tabled are merely technical adjustments, I have voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report even though our amendment was not adopted."
"In relation to national priorities in the context of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), I consider it important to invest not only in railways but, above all, in motorways of the sea and the interoperability and cooperability of the various kinds of transport."
"Only a genuine combined transport network, supported by effective management, will be able to ensure the competitiveness of the maritime alternative."
"Maritime transport is essential to my country, which enjoys privileged access to navigable waterways, and truly crucial to outermost and island regions, as in the case of Madeira."
"In addition, it is an essential tool for continuing the consolidation of the internal market and for territorial cohesion."
"This report is broadly supported not only in Parliament but also in the Commission and Council."
"It is also markedly technical."
"Its adoption in this Chamber follows its practically unanimous recommendation by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"In short, this proposal, which I personally supported, does not amend the content of the TEN-T text but just adds maps of the 12 Member States that joined the Union in 2004 and 2007."
"A revision of the Union guidelines for the development of the TEN-T is in preparation and will be ready only towards the end of 2010."
"The EU has 5 million kilometres of roads (62 thousand kilometres of motorways), 215 thousand kilometres of railways and 41 thousand kilometres of internal waterways."
"It is hoped that intercommunication among Member States will double by 2020."
"A united Europe is impossible without a coordinated and effective Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T)."
"On the basis of a respective EU treaty, investment in the TEN-T will reach around EUR 500 billion."
"It is therefore important to ensure European cooperation and carefully select priority projects."
"The TEN-T is intended to link land, sea and air transport networks throughout Europe by 2020."
"The main objective is to ensure fast and easy movement of people and goods among Member States."
"A motorway of a European standard connects Lithuania's largest port KlaipÄda with Vilnius, and a railway line connects the latter with Moscow and the East."
"If we want the port to remain competitive we need to modernise its current infrastructure and remove red tape."
"Railways and internal waterways should in particular be used for long distance transport and roads for short distances."
"More effort should be devoted to cargo transit and internal waterway transport, which is more cost-effective and energy efficient, non-polluting and safe."
"The most important thing is passenger safety and protection."
"The financial crisis has had an impact on transport policy. However, the TEN-T may be used to create jobs and observe social and economic cohesion."
"The Europe 2020 strategy recognises the importance of transport policy for Europe's economy."
"Free movement of people and goods is what defines the EU."
"This is only possible with a good TEN-T."
"I voted in favour of this report because I believe that, in order to address the current crisis, we need to find ways to speed up the implementation of aid programmes, so that Union funding aimed in particular at supporting citizens, and more specifically the unemployed, can be used more fully."
"This proposal aims at making a number of regulatory changes in order to simplify the implementation rules for cohesion policy and to increase the pre-financing (advance payments) to European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and European Social Fund (ESF) programmes."
"Economic forecasts predict a major reduction in EU growth of 1.1% in 2010."
"In this context, this report represents a reaction to the financial crisis and its socioeconomic repercussions."
"Hence I consider it extremely important for achieving greater transparency and simplification of the rules governing cohesion policy."
"This contribution will have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation, particularly by providing national, regional and local authorities with clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility in adapting the programmes to the new challenges."
"Last year the Commission presented a proposal amending the Regulation on Structural Funds (1083/2006) in order to provide financial incentives to Member States hit hard by the economic crisis."
"One of the measures put forward in the Commission's proposal was a derogation from the principle of cofinancing by introducing a temporary option for Member States suffering from cash-flow problems to request a 100% reimbursement for financing measures eligible under the European Social Fund."
"The Council rejected this proposal, but agreed to the extension of the deadline for calculating the automatic decommitment of the annual budget commitments relating to the 2007 total annual contribution to improve the absorption of funds committed to certain operational programmes."
"I believe that the rapporteur's proposed temporary measure of reconstituting the appropriations for the 2007 financial year for the assistance funds as part of the European Social Fund, as a result of decommitments made, is justified, in view of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which would prevent the application of Article 93(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 in its current form."
"The European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund have proved to be effective and extremely useful instruments for territorial development and for tackling the consequences of the economic crisis which has afflicted Europe and the world for some time now."
"In this regard, I welcome the proposals to simplify the procedures for the decommitment of the funds and to facilitate payments to the beneficiaries of the various programmes implemented using the aforesaid funds."
"Furthermore, I am in favour of providing an additional pre-financing instalment for 2010 for the Member States worst hit by the crisis."
"As referent on this report for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I called on my colleagues to vote in favour of this text."
"As far as the simplifications contained in this report are concerned, I am convinced that they are a very good thing."
"This is a real leap forward: there is less information to provide, greater flexibility with regard to revenue-generating projects, fewer checks by the Commission for environmental projects worth EUR 25 to 50 million, and so on."
"As for the financial aspect, I called for the initial proposal to be refocused."
"Indeed, it would not have been a good idea to call into question the principle of cofinancing expenditure and to implement projects wholly funded by the European Social Fund (ESF), as the Commission proposed."
"In order to balance expenditure in the long term, some Member States would have been faced with severe financial difficulties."
"Parliament has found a compromise allowing us to help the countries worst affected by the crisis and to avoid decommitment for 2007."
"Through this vote we are giving great support to the beneficiaries of EU funds as well as to the initiating departments."
"Let us not forget, however, that there is still a great deal to do in terms of simplification."
"It is important to stress that the pressure on national financial resources continues to rise and necessitates taking further steps to alleviate this pressure through a better use of EU funding, and mobilisation and acceleration of all available Funds to tackle the crisis, in particular using the European Social Fund (ESF) for rapid recovery packages, as outlined in the Communication mentioned."
"It is particularly important that there should be more effort to facilitate the management of EU funding in order to speed up the flow of funding to beneficiaries that are most affected by the economic downturn."
"It is important to achieve the overall objective of streamlining cofinanced investments in Member States and regions and of increasing the impact of funding on the whole economy, in particular, on small and medium-sized enterprises and on employment."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are the motor of the European economy and the main producers of sustainable growth, creating numerous quality jobs."
"Further simplification and clarification of rules governing cohesion policy will undeniably have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation, particularly by providing national, regional and local authorities with clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility in order to adapt the programmes to the new challenges."
"in writing. - The report concerns the financial management of some of the most important funds within the European Union."
"These are inclusive of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund."
"After a careful analysis of the proposal for regulation as well as Article 161 of the EC Treaty in addition to other documents, I was inclined to support the position of the rapporteur and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"The amendment of the regulation on implementing the Structural and Cohesion Funds is a measure aimed at supporting EU Member States during the current crisis."
"Above all, it meets their demands for simplifying the management of the funds."
"I believe that the new provisions will help, at the same time, to reduce the risk of funds being lost due to not being used quickly enough, as a longer time frame is being offered for projects which have not been approved or implemented yet during the specified period."
"I also hope that these simplified rules will come into force as soon as possible so that Member States and, in particular, the regions intended to be able to benefit from this option of EU funding, as well as the public authorities in these regions, will continue to invest in European projects in spite of budgetary constraints."
"The Democratic Movement delegation welcomes the adoption of a report allowing the simplification of some provisions of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund."
"Relaxing the deadlines for the use of the funds is a major step forward."
"The current rules stipulate that aid must be used within two years of it being obtained, or else it has to be returned."
"The new rules will mean that regions and Member States do not lose funds committed in 2007 for projects whose implementation has been delayed."
"Henceforth, environmental projects totalling less than EUR 50 million will no longer need to be the subject of a specific application by Member States for approval by the European Commission."
"Additional financial advances for 2010 will be authorised for those Member States worst affected by the economic and financial crisis."
"The simplification of some provisions will also make it easier to review the Operational Programmes under way and will allow us to respond better to crisis situations."
"For example, the regions affected by storm Xynthia will be able to use this new flexibility to help the victims of that disaster."
"The Commission has submitted a proposed amendment to the regulation on the Structural Funds, the aim of which is to provide Member States seriously affected by the financial crisis with the necessary economic stimulus."
"The amendment should lead to the application of so-called support thresholds."
"A threshold of EUR 50 million should apply, instead of the current EUR 25 million."
"Large projects should also be protected from automatic decommitment."
"Some states should also be allowed to apply for the reimbursement of 100% of the costs of measures in the labour market from the European Social Fund."
"If it is possible from a budgetary perspective to commence financing without the need for joint participation, which I doubt very much, then the only correct and possible way is to compare the rules and regulations for everything by the same yardstick."
"It is totally unacceptable for some Member States to be identified as 'more affected by the crisis' and for them to be exempted from the rules for these reasons."
"If there must be exemptions, let them be applied to everyone in the same way!"
"The EU is not such an enormous entity that we can deduce different consequences of the financial crisis for Member States."
"Economies are interconnected and the consequences of economic management cut both ways."
"It would also be wrong for us to disallow exemptions in order to penalise Member States that are trying to stimulate their own economies and not expecting assistance from the EU."
"Even in times of crisis let us fight for equal conditions in equivalent situations!"
"The report takes account of this and I therefore support its adoption."
"I welcome the adoption of the Kirilov report, which I supported with my vote."
"I believe that the adoption of this report so soon after the Commission's Communication will be beneficial as the measures set out in it will speed up the funding process, helping boost the economic recovery in the regions, which is an absolute necessity during the current crisis."
"The report is part of the guidelines drawn up by the Council on the amendments relating to the rules on the financial management of programmes cofinanced by the ESP, as well as to those concerning the implementation of programmes intended to facilitate, simplify and clarify the regulations governing cohesion policy."
"In Romania's case, this means increasing the volume of advance payments for the European Social Fund and Cohesion Fund, and more time for using European funds by 'decommitting' them so that Member States can reuse the funds as part of the programme."
"Other amendments include simplifying and clarifying the measures required to implement the Structural Funds, both during the phase of submitting the funding applications and when drafting the annual report on the programme's implementation."
"There is also the agreement on a single EUR 50 million threshold, which defines a major project that will be able to qualify for funding from several European programmes."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund as regards simplification of certain requirements and as regards provisions relating to financial management."
"The severe and unprecedented impact of the current economic and financial crisis on the Member States' budgets means that the management of cohesion policy must be simplified and advance payments increased."
"Despite the difficult situation, these measures will make it possible to maintain a regular cash flow to ensure payments can be made to beneficiaries as these programmes are implemented."
"In my view, EU cohesion policy is a central factor in the development and implementation of the principle of solidarity among Member States that the European Union advocates."
"As such, and particularly in times of crisis - when these funds can help specifically to mitigate the impact felt in the most deprived regions - it is essential to improve the current structure of cohesion policy, so that the funds can be allocated more efficiently and can produce more effective results in good time."
"Moreover, the instruments need to be made more flexible, because rigid instruments that cannot adapt to unforeseen circumstances, such as a crisis, are damaging to the European Union's economic development."
"It is also important to ensure that the funds made available under cohesion policy are being duly utilised by the Member States and that the available resources are spent efficiently."
"I therefore consider it vital to rethink not only the structure of Union cohesion policy but also the control mechanisms available, as well as the methods of coercion that can be used in the event of non-compliance by Member States."
"The purpose of this proposal is to provide additional economic stimulus to certain Member States, which had seriously suffered from the economic crises."
"It followed the European Economic Recovery Plan, in the context of which the implementing provisions of the aforementioned basic regulation had already been modified in 2009 to allow more flexibility with advance payments."
"The main element of the Commission proposal aimed to address the consequences of the financial crisis."
"The solution proposed was to introduce a temporary option for Member States suffering from severe cash-flow difficulties to request a 100% reimbursement for financing labour market measures under the European Social Fund, that is to say, derogation from the principle of cofinancing."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has entailed a change in the legislative procedure."
"Instead of the assent procedure, where Parliament was only able to say 'yes' or 'no', Parliament acquired a full say in the content of the text under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"That is why I voted for this proposal, and it is to be hoped that the Commission will make a corresponding proposal for an amending budget for examination and adoption by the budgetary authority."
"The Commission proposal involves the introduction of a temporary option, to which Member States with severe cash-flow difficulties could turn in order to finance necessary growth and employment promotion measures designed to combat the crisis and eligible under the European Social Fund."
"That would allow Member States to ask the Commission for 100% reimbursements for 2009 and 2010, so that national cofinancing would not be needed during this period."
"This is a measure that we have been advocating, so as to make the full utilisation of EU funds possible at a time when they are most needed."
"The Council's position is different, however, and merely points out that 'an additional pre-financing instalment [...] is needed for the Member States worst hit by the crisis'."
"The document on which Parliament is voting takes the side of the Council position, which we believe is more ambiguous and less favourable to the Member States worst hit by the crisis."
"We believe, however, that 'to extend the deadline for the calculation of the automatic decommitment of the annual budget commitment relating to the 2007 total annual contribution to improve the absorption of funds committed for certain operational programmes' is a positive point."
"The major challenges which the European Union has been confronted with due to the economic and financial crisis have resulted in the launch of certain priority actions which will help national economies adapt to the situation that has been created."
"I voted for the report as I am strongly in favour of granting additional financial incentives to Member States which have been hit hard by the economic crisis, as well as of simplifying the aspects relating to financial management."
"All countries could benefit from postponing decommitments, while countries in the direst situation would benefit from additional advance payments."
"These countries are Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania."
"Further clarification of the regulations on cohesion policy and simplification of the procedures will have a positive influence on the programmes' implementation rate."
"This step is especially important as cohesion policy is the most powerful instrument in terms of granting aid to the real economy."
"Simplifying access to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Cohesion Fund is an essential part of supporting the Member States most affected by the economic crisis that we are experiencing."
"As we find out the extent of the damage caused to the real economy and the labour market by the financial crisis, we must take measures to improve access to the Union's financing instruments."
"There must be a regular flow of funds that allows payments to be made to beneficiaries as programmes are implemented."
"In times of crisis, the EU is once again showing its true colours."
"When the eastern EU Member States had to freeze during the Russian gas dispute there was little sign of solidarity."
"Now, when it concerns the economic chestnut of the euro - the flagship of the EU - suddenly something is possible."
"EU subsidies have even been adjusted accordingly."
"Although the possible 100% reimbursement for 2009 and 2010 for financing labour market policy measures did not promote further education and high-quality apprenticeships to the extent that we would have liked, it is certainly essential in the current situation."
"All Member States would benefit from the decommitment of the budget commitment and those countries with the most problems would receive additional advance payments."
"Putting money into a bottomless pit at will without accompanying measures can be dangerous."
"I have therefore rejected the proposal."
"In view of the economic and financial crisis, optimum use must be made of measures which will simplify certain procedures specific to accessing European funds."
"These include:"
"granting an additional funding advance for 2010 to Member States affected by the crisis, thereby ensuring a steady cash flow and facilitating payments to beneficiaries during the programmes' implementation phase;"
"extending the deadline for calculating the automatic decommitment of the annual budget commitment relating to the 2007 total annual contribution, which will improve the absorption of funds committed to certain operational programmes and ensure adequate support for the initiatives in favour of maintaining and creating jobs;"
"Member States which received support in 2009, in accordance with the legislation which establishes a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments, can benefit in 2010, under certain conditions, from 2% of the contribution from the Cohesion Fund and 4% from the contribution of the ESF to the operational programme."
"These measures will contribute to the development of a flexible, inclusive labour market and to a significant improvement in the positive impact generated by EU funding on the economy as a whole, but particularly on small and medium-sized businesses and on the labour market."
"in writing. - I voted against this report because we, the Verts/ALE Group, tabled six amendments and all were rejected."
"I voted in favour of this proposal since I believe it is a matter of great importance for Portugal, and particularly for its outermost regions, which are more vulnerable to the crisis we are experiencing, since they feel its effects more intensely and take longer to emerge from it."
"Although I generally agree with its content, I must highlight the difficulties faced by regional and local authorities in securing the release of funds that would enable them to provide their part of the financing of projects subsidised by EU funding."
"I was disappointed to see that the Council blocked the possibility of increasing the proportion of EU cofinancing to 100%, even temporarily and in the form of an advance payment that would be offset in the later years of the programmes."
"The compromise solution, albeit not perfect, means that EU funds for 2007 that have not been absorbed by programmes that have been slow to start up will, exceptionally, benefit from an extended deadline before being decommitted."
"We are all aware of the difficult choices that families and companies are having to make these days, and of how important measures like those now being planned can be for the economic recovery, which we hope will be rapid and sustained."
"The global financial crisis has affected all of the EU Member States."
"I feel that the Baltic States have suffered the most painful blow."
"Severe measures were taken because of the financial hurricane and jobs were lost."
"However, we have a unique opportunity to turn the crisis into an opportunity."
"We would like to give young Lithuanians a very promising future in Lithuania and avoid the increasing 'brain drain'."
"This task is impossible without the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, in particular, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)."
"The Structural Funds constitute a large portion of EU funding: - EUR 277 billion were allocated for the 2007-2013 budget."
"The ERDF stimulates economic development and recovery in less prosperous parts of the EU."
"It helps to fund measures like the regeneration of industrial areas affected by the reduction of towns and villages."
"It includes important regional programmes, such as the Baltic Sea Region Programme, in order to strengthen regional identity and recognition."
"The Cohesion Fund plays an important role in reducing differences between EU Member States, particularly in terms of environment and trans-European transport networks."
"Today (2007-2013), the European Social Fund also has a vital role to play by helping business and workers adapt to the new market conditions and supporting workplace innovations, lifelong learning and increased mobility."
"Lithuania's ESF programme is solving the manpower shortage by mobilising human resources and improving skills and raising qualification levels."
"Since joining the EU, Lithuania has experienced a massive 'brain drain'."
"The best way of combating this is investing the EU Structural Funds in young professionals."
"I voted for this resolution submitted by the Conference of Committee Chairs, which requests the Commission to submit new proposals for those dossiers which were pending in Parliament at the time of the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force and the procedure for which has lapsed."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the 'Proposal for a Council Recommendation on measures to combat neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's, through joint programming of research activities', I support the invitation presented by the Conference of Committee Chairs to the European Commission to submit a new proposal on these dossiers so that Parliament is consulted in a manner appropriate to its institutional role also assigned by the provisions of the new Treaty."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament gets straight down to all the most important policies of the European Union."
"It provides the legal modifications needed for it to play a full role on the institutional stage and the international stage alike."
"The European Parliament can at last fully guarantee that the interests of EU citizens are defended, and that is why I voted for this resolution."
"The Treaty of Lisbon clearly grants Parliament new responsibilities and new powers."
"With its entry into force on 1 December 2009, many proposals that had been tabled by the Commission on the basis of the Treaties, but which were still pending on that date (at different stages in the legislative or non-legislative process) will be subject to changes."
"In some cases there will be differences at the level of the decision-making procedure, either because the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure has been significantly extended, or because a new approval procedure applies in respect of the conclusion of international agreements."
"In other cases, there is just a change in legal basis."
"The Commission is seeking to change them formally by means of its 'omnibus' proposal."
"There are, however, some proposals (which came under the former third pillar) where the legal framework has changed substantially and they have therefore lapsed and must be replaced with new ones."
"As the rapporteur of the initiative to set up an assessment mechanism to monitor the implementation of the Schengen acquis, I call on the Commission to submit the new proposals as quickly as possible."
"I therefore support this House's motion for a resolution."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision-making procedures."
"The entry into force of the new Treaty means that the legal bases of various pending files must be redefined."
"The Commission and the Council must urgently make the necessary changes in light of the new legislative framework."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has not only imposed a new institutional arrangement and a new hierarchy of legislation, but also requires special precautions with regard to decision-making procedures that were still ongoing on that date."
"In these cases the legal bases have changed, as have the procedures relating to them, fully justifying their re-examination."
"The Treaty of Lisbon grants Parliament new responsibilities and new powers."
"With its entry into force on 1 December 2009, many proposals that had been tabled by the Commission on the basis of the Treaties but which were still pending on that date will be subject to changes."
"In some cases there will be differences at the level of the decision-making procedure, either because the scope of the ordinary legislative procedure has been significantly extended, or because a new approval procedure applies in respect of the conclusion of international agreements."
"In other cases, there is just a change in legal basis."
"The Commission is seeking to change them formally by means of its 'omnibus' proposal."
"There are, however, some proposals (which came under the former third pillar) where the legal framework has changed substantially and they have therefore lapsed and must be replaced with new ones."
"I am therefore voting in favour of this resolution of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - I vote against the Motion for Resolution on the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision-making procedures as it includes the regulation about the so called ""direct tradeâ between the EU and the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus."
"The legal basis of the regulation is absolutely wrong, as the European Commission chose Article 133 of the Treaty - now Article 207(2) after the Lisbon Treaty - which addresses issues with Third Countries."
"Using such a legal basis would be against Protocol 10 on Cyprus that clearly provides that the Republic of Cyprus entered the EU as complete territory with the suspension of the Union acquis in the northern part of the island due to the Turkish occupation."
"The existing legal basis of the regulation insults the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of a member state of the EU, the Republic of Cyprus, and it is against the principles and the values upon which the EU is founded and the European Parliament should respect and promote as the beacon of the European democracy."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr SzÃ¡jer, whom I would like to thank for his excellent analysis carried out in the light of the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Given the wide-ranging and diverse implications that 'delegated acts' will have for legislative procedure, I believe that Parliament's wish to apply specific and clear conditions to these delegated acts, in order to ensure that this House has real democratic control over them, is particularly commendable."
"I think that we will also need, in particular, to test in practice how this new system will work, in order to make any necessary changes to it."
"The Treaty of Lisbon addresses the democratic deficit by strengthening the powers of both the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"That is the framework for this new instrument, which allows the legislator to delegate part of its powers to the Commission (Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), provided that it is an act of general application that is used to supplement or amend parts of a legislative act that are not considered essential."
"It will thus make it quicker and simpler to fill gaps or to regulate or update more detailed aspects in a legislative act, avoiding excessively complicated and prolonged legislative procedures, which used to have negative consequences for the public."
"Two aspects that have been safeguarded are the fact that the delegation may be withdrawn at any time and the fact that Parliament's (and the Council's) prior assent is needed before the entry into force of acts approved by the Commission under a delegation."
"I support this innovation, which should take the place of the notorious 'comitology' system, but we now urgently need to set out how these delegations can be made, their scope, their objective, the working methods to be used and the terms on which the legislator can exercise control."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon requires clarification of some of its norms, particularly those with legal and procedural content, such as those addressing the legislative procedure, the hierarchy of norms and the powers of the institutions."
"Article 290(1) of the Treaty states that a legislative act may delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of the legislative act."
"It does so with special reservations and severely restricts the scope of such acts."
"Nevertheless, this detailing of the law set out in the Treaty is important to prevent excessively disparate interpretations that would jeopardise the consistency of EU law."
"Although such acts are common in the Member States, that cannot be said of the acts in question."
"The legitimacy of the Commission and of the Member States' governments is not the same, and therefore the delegation of legislation to the former requires greater care and attention, and it must be used sparingly."
"I agree that the use of legislative delegation should make it possible to adopt simple and accessible legislation, thus contributing to legal certainty, the efficacy of the delegate and control by the delegator."
"According to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the legislator can delegate a certain amount of power to the Commission, in which connection the Commission may only supplement or amend a legislative act."
"The 'delegated acts' adopted accordingly by the Commission are non-legislative acts of general application."
"The rapporteur is advocating the stricter monitoring of the Commission in its exercising of its delegated legislative powers."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the adoption of the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the SzÃ¡jer report on power of legislative delegation and Speroni report on Ransdorf's immunity."
"It was adopted by a large majority."
"I voted in favour of the report on the power of legislative delegation."
"Article 290 of the Treaty of Lisbon allows Parliament to raise objections to or revoke the Commission's amendments and supplements to legislative acts."
"However, this requires an absolute majority, in other words a majority of the number of elected MEPs."
"In view of the absence of Members, this normally means 60% of those voting."
"Previously, only the Council was able to do this, provided a qualified majority of votes was obtained."
"The Commission's expert groups, which are hand-picked from the Member States, have a great deal of influence in legislative delegation."
"One example of this is provided by the fact that, via an expert group, the Commission permitted a new type of genetically modified maize, despite the fact that Parliament and the Council were opposed to this."
"Another example is the original Services Directive, where the Council and Parliament deleted a paragraph that stated that it was to be prohibited to demand a permanent representative in the case of the posting of workers, in other words a trade union counterpart."
"The Commission went against this, however, and drew up guidelines establishing that it was not necessary to have a permanent representative."
"The Commission wants to safeguard its independence and continue to use its expert groups."
"The rapporteur, Mr SzÃ¡jer, rejects both national expert groups and the involvement of national authorities."
"I do not agree with the latter point."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has changed the former system of comitology by reference to new legal instruments, such as delegated acts and implementing acts."
"With the new Treaty, Parliament takes on the role of co-legislator, together with the Council."
"Enshrining in the Treaty the ability to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts to supplement legislative acts is a step forwards in that it places the two institutions on an equal footing."
"This report seeks to clarify the terms on which the delegation of powers by Parliament and the Council to the Commission, pursuant to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, can take place."
"The document stresses the importance of the principle of the freedom of the legislator to delegate its powers to the Commission as a tool for better law-making."
"The report upholds the need to avoid imposing on the legislator additional obligations over and above those already contained in the Treaty."
"The legislator must allow the Commission to exercise the delegated power effectively and must duly monitor the use made of it."
"For the reasons mentioned above, and considering that the main priority must be to adapt the acquis in areas that were not subject to the codecision procedure prior to the Treaty of Lisbon, I voted in favour of the document."
"The competitiveness of European maritime transport should remain one of the strategic objectives of European Union maritime transport policy."
"In order to achieve this goal we must ensure the necessary support for innovations, scientific research and their development, which would accelerate the modernisation of sea port infrastructure and ensure the application of the latest technologies in the shipbuilding industry."
"A reduction of the administrative burden and red tape would lead to an increase in private and public sector investments in the sea port and shipping sectors."
"Development of the trans-European transport network, provision for motorways of the sea and development of the intermodality of means of transport would lead to the creation of a European maritime transport system that is competitive and receptive to innovations."
"We also need to address the issue of the alignment of taxation applied to crews sailing under the European Union flag."
"The European Union's marine territory is the most extensive in the world."
"The maritime economy provides work for five million people, whilst 5% of the EU's GDP comes from industries and services with a direct connection to this sector."
"Data and facts show categorically that the sea constitutes a crucial resource for employment and growth in Member States, especially taking into consideration its international dimension, and hence the amount of pressure it has to endure in terms of global competition."
"On this point, the report offers many positive points with regard to the demand for incentives for the maritime sector at national level, and for greater regulatory coordination at EU level."
"This could begin to cut red tape, which would help to increase the competitiveness of the entire sector."
"I agree with the approach of the report, and this is why I shall be voting in favour of it."
"The Democratic Movement delegation welcomes the adoption of strategic goals for the EU's maritime transport until 2018."
"The resolution adopted calls in particular for the enhancement of maritime professionals through the strengthening of professional qualifications and the harmonisation of European training."
"Indeed, it is essential to provide lifelong learning and retraining for seafarers at all levels, on shore and on board."
"With this in mind, the Member States must urgently ratify the International Labour Organisation's 2006 Maritime Labour Convention."
"For maritime transport to remain one of the least polluting means of transport, progress still needs to be made in reducing emissions of sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, particulates (PM10) and CO2."
"That is why the Democratic Movement MEPs regret the Commission's refusal to include the maritime sector in the EU emissions trading systems."
"We must continue to make progress in this direction and, to do so, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will have to set reduction targets, applicable to all the Member States, which will allow us to avoid distortions of competition with third-country fleets."
"The Commission has put forward a communication on strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018."
"The Commission's proposal covers a wide range of topics relating to EU maritime transport policy, allowing maritime transport stakeholders ample scope and initiative to realise the strategic objectives and recommendations that are set out in it."
"The main issues addressed by the Commission's proposal are: (i) the value and competitive position of European maritime shipping in a global market; (ii) employment opportunities in the maritime sector; (iii) the quality of European shipping; (iv) international cooperation; (v) European maritime transport as part of the European economy and as a driving force behind economic integration; and (vi) Europe as a world leader in maritime research and innovation."
"In view of Portugal's geographical position and the strategic importance of the sea, this subject is of fundamental relevance to our country, and every effort to develop an 'economy of the sea' deserves our support and commitment."
"Europe's maritime sector makes a clear and vital contribution both to the Union's internal economy and to its transport system."
"The interests of the European maritime transport sector must therefore be assigned high priority in establishing general European transport policy."
"It must be realised that the European maritime sector mainly operates and competes in a global market."
"The maritime transport sector faces major challenges with regard to the environment."
"The primary task is to improve the environmental performance of seagoing ships substantially, and emissions of SOx, NOx, particulates and CO2 must be reduced."
"In this regard, I would stress the need to reach agreements on the subject at global level in order to combat the risk of reflagging to non-participating countries."
"As far as security is concerned, I would highlight the fact that Member States are called upon to implement the package quickly and correctly, particularly as regards the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (referring to risk-based inspections)."
"This will prevent unnecessary inspections, increase the effectiveness of monitoring and reduce the red tape for those subject to inspections."
"The call to reduce the carbon footprint of vessels and port infrastructures, improving facilities for seafarers, the call to reduce emissions of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates (PM10) and CO2 or even the creation of maritime emission control areas are many measures that may have a positive outcome depending on how they are applied."
"The permanent pre-eminence of free and undistorted competition, however, and the subordination of seafarers' rights to competitiveness mean that this report goes against seafarers' interests and the general interest."
"That is why I am voting against this text."
"With the adoption of this report, the objectives necessary for the existence of a Union maritime transport policy are being defined."
"This mode of transport has been moving towards centre stage, because it is one that is environmentally friendly and has the potential to become even more so."
"The maritime transport sector is essential to the European economy, not only in terms of transporting passengers, primary materials, commodities and energy products, but also because it is central to a broad range of maritime activities, such as the naval industry, logistics, research, tourism, fishing and aquaculture, to name but a few examples."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Van Dalen report on maritime transport strategy up to 2018, although our amendment on including maritime transport in the ETS was rejected by large majority (roll-call vote)."
"The future of the European maritime transport sector plays a very large role in the European Union from an economic and social, as well as environmental, point of view."
"The vote which took place today puts in place a strategy for European maritime transport policy until 2018, and maybe this will have a direct effect on the 41% of fleets which belong to Europe, and indirectly to the maritime transport sector of the whole world."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supported this report, as it mostly meets our expectations, and our proposals for improvement received support."
"In our opinion, the following keywords must play a leading role in the maritime transport sector in the future: efficiency, environmental friendliness and equal market conditions."
"Therefore, it is important that the report being adopted today calls on all Member States to ratify the convention of the International Maritime Organisation, in order to ensure better conditions for seafarers and ship owners, as well as for the environment."
"Finally, I thank the rapporteur for his high level of cooperation and openness during the drafting of the report."
"Maritime transport is, without a shadow of a doubt, a competitive advantage for Europe, but much remains to be done to promote intermodality and co-modality, which also involves the repositioning of maritime transport as a truly competitive alternative."
"The maritime industry is facing a number of challenges, which can turn into genuine opportunities if we know how to make use of them by investing in the training of young technicians to make up for the shortage of professionals in the sector."
"Technological development and cutting out unnecessary red tape to attract investment into the port sector are also priorities."
"Safer and cleaner shipping must also be sought, by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and offering an effective response to acts of piracy."
"The pressures threatening the position of Europe's maritime fleet, which stem mainly from the state aid given to the sector in third countries, must be managed within a framework to be developed in the World Trade Organisation."
"Europe's infrastructure and port capacity deserve to continue being developed, as do the motorways of the sea, which are very important to southern and peripheral countries like Portugal and to outermost regions such as Madeira."
"The report we have adopted today covers these guidelines in general terms, and has therefore won my support."
"More than 80% of world trade takes place at sea, and maritime transport remains the backbone of international trade."
"The EU is the most significant global exporter and the second biggest importer."
"Therefore, shipping and similar services are essential if we want European companies to compete on a global scale."
"Coastal shipping is an important part of the European transport chain, carrying 40% of cargo within Europe."
"Every year more than 400 million passengers use European ports, and therefore maritime transport directly affects the quality of European citizens' lives."
"The European Parliament is one of the defenders of maritime policy in the EU."
"The EU's maritime transport policy also supports other policies, in particular an integrated maritime policy."
"The global financial crisis has also affected the maritime transport sector."
"Therefore, now we really must release the economic potential of European seafaring to stimulate economic growth and social and environmental stability."
"The long-term competitiveness of European shipping is the cornerstone of EU maritime policy."
"This strategy fosters safe, clean and effective shipping and the creation of jobs in the European maritime policy industry."
"A strategic vision, taking into account the development of shipping, ports and similar sectors, is important for the simplification of EU maritime policy so that it can face future challenges, for example, combating piracy and reducing the environmental impact of shipping."
"An integrated, intersectoral approach, including policies on fishing, transport, the environment, energy, industry and scientific research is essential."
"The days of European neighbours competing are over."
"This applies both to Lithuania and to the rest of Europe."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which integrates some of my proposals for the future of maritime transport policy and its related sectors, whether in terms of shipbuilding, tourism or fisheries."
"To me it was important to reaffirm the necessity of security as a prerequisite for maritime transport and to stress, in spite of the difficult economic context, the need to respect high standards of protection of the marine and coastal environment."
"The expected increase in the volume of goods and passengers, the strictest environmental standards and the need to promote intermodality and modal shifts make the modernisation of port infrastructures necessary."
"These structural measures require significant investment combined with transparent and fair financing rules in order to support innovation and increase the competitiveness of European ports."
"Finally, I welcome the fact that the social dimension features in our strategy and that it stresses, in particular, employment, training, the enhancement of maritime professionals and the improvement of seafarers' working conditions on shore and on board."
"'Europeana', the European digital library, is a single, direct, multilingual portal designed for Europe's cultural heritage."
"It will, in the future, provide a large number of readers with access to rare or old documents from Europe's heritage, which are difficult to access because of the way they are stored."
"In the motion for a resolution voted on today, I asked the European Commission to launch a special campaign in the media and online, aimed at students and teachers and focusing on using the digital resources offered by this portal for educational purposes, in order to raise the profile of the Europeana site."
"The Europeana portal should become one of the reference points for education and research which will bring young people in Europe closer to their cultural heritage and help create transcultural cohesion in the EU."
"In this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament encourages Member States to make equal contributions to the content of the Europeana project and step up their efforts in providing works to libraries and national cultural institutions so that all Europeans can have full access to their own cultural heritage."
"Europeana, the European digital library, is demonstrating a great ambition, namely to digitise all European works in order to make them accessible to the general public."
"This is a long-term task that requires close monitoring and measurable progress."
"The own-initiative report proposes a target of 15 million works being made available by 2015, as well as access to the website for all, and in all of the languages of the European Union."
"This European project is essential: it contributes to the enhancement of our common heritage, to its influence in the world and thus prevents the monopolisation of these works by private players."
"I therefore voted resolutely in favour of this ambitious project."
"in writing. - I supported the report, as I believe that access to cultural and educational information must be a priority in order to improve educational and living standards in Europe."
"In view of the benefits for all EU citizens of accessing 'Europeana' library, its availability in all the official languages should be envisaged as soon as possible."
"As also people with disabilities should have the benefit of digital technology and enjoy easier access to education and information through accessible formats and adapted technologies."
"The availability of 'Europeana' should be improved ensuring free-of-charge access for pupils, students and teachers in secondary schools, universities and other educational institutions."
"Therefore it is essential to guarantee and simplify universal access to European cultural heritage and to ensure that it be promoted and preserved for generations to come."
"The collection and preservation of the artistic and cultural heritage of European Union Member States, by establishing a multimedia platform that gathers together images, sounds and videos to create a resource that is simultaneously a library, a museum and an archive: this is the aim of the Europeana project which, launched in 2008, is now putting European artistic heritage online thanks to the contribution of more than 1 000 cultural institutions."
"Although it still has a number of weak points, including publicising and raising awareness of the project itself, the problem of putting 'orphan' works or works subject to copyright online and, not least, a certain patchiness of the objects and materials made available, Europeana is nevertheless exploiting new forms of technology to computerise European cultural heritage on a large scale, drawing not only on EU resources, but also on national and private resources."
"The preservation of artistic memory, and of the representations and cultural particularities of individual Member States, is essential to ensure that the younger generations have a strong sense of their own identity."
"For this reason, I am in favour of the draft report."
"As a result of the vote given in favour of the report 'Europeana - the next steps' and as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I welcome that this report has been finalised and I hope that its recommendations will be adopted by the Commission."
"Following the debates on the report within the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, a whole range of subjects have been discussed, such as IT structure, management of the Europeana.eu site, free access to library information, the need to standardise digitisation procedures and the problem of media coverage for the website."
"Some of these subjects have also been included in the report of the main committee, the Committee on Culture and Education, which gives me hope that we have successfully achieved a complete report."
"However, I believe that certain matters, which were not adopted in their entirety, must continue to be discussed, such as managing the site, funding methods and, above all, organising the site in the form of a single database and not a portal."
"I hope that the recommendations specified by us, along with the Commission's reflections on the issues mentioned above, will turn this into a successful project."
"Europeana can become a successful project for the European Union as long as it is built on the EU's values and ideals and provides the focal point for European cultural information."
"I voted in favour of the report on 'Europeana - the next steps', which encourages all EU Member States to be more active in making available contributions from their national libraries and cultural institutions, so that all Europeans have full access to their own cultural heritage."
"The target of storing more than 15 million works on the site in the short term may help to protect Europe's cultural heritage, so that future generations may be able to put together a collective European memory."
"Even during the periods when divisions and even hostility between the countries of Europe were most evident, European culture and science have always been able to cross those borders and spread throughout the area that today makes up the Union, and even beyond."
"It is more than fair to highlight the role of the universities in that respect."
"With their religious origins, they played a decisive part in reconnecting the sundered parts of what came to be the respublica christiana, and in remembering all those who were able to overcome the divisions and make their ideas heard throughout the continent and, from there, throughout the world."
"As a Portuguese and an heir to a language and culture that spread around the world, I support the efforts that are being made to make European culture and science more visible and accessible to all those who would like to enjoy them."
"In that respect, Europeana is heir to the best European tradition."
"I hope that the project will continue in a sustainable form and that my country, in line with its universalist vocation, will collaborate in it with renewed commitment."
"Europeana opened in November 2008 and its aim is to make Europe's cultural and scientific heritage accessible to all on the Internet."
"Europeana currently has a catalogue of 6 million digitised works and the aim is to reach 10 million entries by June 2010."
"The second phase of the project will see the launch of a fully operational Europeana.eu in 2011, which will be more multilingual in character and will have semantic web features."
"Only 5% of all digital books are available in Europeana and almost half of these come from France, followed by Germany (16%), the Netherlands (8%), and the United Kingdom (8%)."
"All other countries provide 5% or less each."
"An increased contribution by the Member States is desirable."
"I support the call for Europeana to reach a stock of at least 15 million different digitised objects by 2015."
"I agree that special attention should be paid to those works which are fragile and might cease to exist very soon and, among those, audiovisual materials."
"Ways of including in-copyright material must be found, so that it includes current works and those from the recent past."
"The creation of a digital library, museum and archive of European cultural heritage - from literary works to other materials of cultural and scientific importance - will bring significant benefits in the areas of education, research and culture."
"In order to achieve the goal of benefiting the general public, by being available to all, not just in Europe, but also in the rest of the world, it is essential for Europeana to ensure free public access to the material that is made available."
"It is also essential not to forget the importance of doing so in formats and media that ensure access for disabled people."
"Nevertheless, there are certain aspects of the adopted resolution that are less clear and others that have not been sufficiently developed."
"It is not clear how it will be determined what cultural and scientific content will be included in Europeana or by whom, nor how it will be administered; these issues are important in assessing the extent to which it will ensure proper representation of the diversity of Europe's cultural heritage."
"Doubts persist as to how the public-private partnerships proposed in the report and the general financing of the cultural institutions associated with Europeana will work."
"We believe that cultural and scientific heritage belongs to everyone and must be freely accessible to the entire population; it must not be treated as a tradable commodity."
"We must safeguard access for all Europeans to the artistic and cultural treasures of Europe that constitute their heritage."
"It was with this in mind that, in spite of some teething troubles, Europeana, the amazing digital library that today contains nearly 6 million digitised works, was launched in 2008."
"Today we must improve the contents of Europeana while ensuring respect for intellectual property."
"Finally, I myself attach particular importance to improvements being made to facilitate access to this tool for disabled members of the public; therefore, the Member States should provide these people with full access, free of charge, to Europe's collective knowledge by means of accessible formats and appropriate technologies."
"The Europeana project, the European Union's digital library, must be welcomed as an initiative intended to create a European cultural forum, providing Europe's citizens with extensive access to Europe's cultural heritage."
"Unfortunately, although the project was launched back in November 2008, it is not making progress, primarily due to obstacles over copyright, as well as reduced funding."
"The final version of the European Parliament's report adopted today puts forward useful recommendations for managing this project in the future."
"Firstly, the type of funding must be reviewed, with a look at public-private partnerships and contributions from Member States, which are very erratic at the moment."
"Secondly, this report allows us to highlight the fact that real results can be achieved not only through large-scale digitisation of literary works, but also by finding immediate solutions allowing copyright works to be used."
"This report can make an important contribution to the existing framework through the regulations proposed on displaying works, which must be free of charge, while downloading them should be charged at an affordable price."
"The dissemination of European cultural heritage is beneficial for several sectors, particularly education, science, research and tourism, among others."
"However, it is not being disseminated at all well, and there is a big discrepancy between the Member States as regards the digitalisation of their cultural heritage in order to facilitate access to it."
"A joint effort is needed that leads to the quick adoption of new technologies allowing the whole of Europe's cultural heritage to be quickly compiled in high-quality digital formats."
"This effort is needed so that this heritage can be disseminated across the world, thus helping other peoples to get access to Europe's cultural wealth."
"Around a million books, maps and photographs from the EU Member States can be accessed in the Europeana digital library."
"The fact that commercial operators register considerably more hits with Google Books and have progressed further in their development is logical and is associated with the greater level of awareness of Google Books."
"In order to achieve more rapid progress with Europeana and to make the digital library more familiar, we first need to get more universities and institutions involved in the project."
"Only then can we talk about more financial resources."
"Even if Europeana is important for European cultural heritage and knowledge, understanding for an increase in funds - and to be provided from economic-development funds, too - is limited, particularly at a time of financial crisis and in view of the billions going to help Greece."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"The EU motto 'United in Diversity' is very appropriate for the Europeana project."
"I voted for this report since it is the first serious attempt to present the cultural heritage of the whole of Europe in digital format."
"Europe has one of the world's largest cultural treasure troves, which, in my opinion, should be accessible to the broadest spectrum of society."
"It is somewhat regrettable that not all EU countries are equally active in transferring their cultural heritage to virtual space."
"This is particularly the case among new EU Member States."
"We should also mention other as yet unsolved problems: project funding, public and private sector cooperation, and most importantly, the issue of copyright protection."
"They need to be addressed as soon as possible so that the people of Europe and the whole world can access Europe's cultural heritage."
"I hope that the report we have adopted will further accelerate the implementation of the Europeana project."
"The positive vote on the Europeana programme means support for efforts to digitise the cultural heritage of the Member States."
"However, it is very important to note that the objective is to protect the electronic format of works per se, without allowing users to modify them."
"In brief, the objective is not to develop another Internet search engine; it is to develop a website which will simultaneously be a museum, a library and a source of scientific knowledge."
"However, digitisation of the cultural heritage will not be feasible without the help of the Member States and national agencies."
"Unfortunately, 47% of the content of Europeana currently comes from France, while countries which should have a strong presence, given their massive cultural heritage, such as Greece, only represent a scant percentage of the digitised files."
"In addition, particular attention needs to be given to protecting intellectual property rights."
"Digitisation means free access for citizens to knowledge and science; it does not, under any circumstances, mean a new sphere of action for electronic piracy and unaccountability."
"It was in 2000 that the idea of creating a virtual European library was launched."
"The objective was to put European cultural heritage online to make it more accessible for everyone."
"Whoever thinks of Europeana thinks of 'culture'."
"Today, Europeana provides access to seven million 'digitised objects' (namely images, texts, sounds and videos), whether world-renowned works or small hidden treasures, at the click of a mouse."
"More than 1 000 cultural institutions provide it with content and these include galleries, archive centres, libraries and museums (including the Rijksmuseum, the British Library and the Louvre no less)."
"The project is certainly nowhere near finished."
"The new version of Europeana, which is currently under development, will be launched this year with the aim of reaching a volume of more than 10 million digitised objects before June."
"In order to achieve this, several major challenges have still to be overcome."
"They involve enhancing the content in the long term, incorporating more material that is subject to copyright, resolving the issue of out-of-print or orphan works, finding new methods of financing, improving accessibility for disabled people, providing a fully multilingual service, all issues that are addressed shrewdly in the text that we voted on and which I, as a result, supported."
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I endorse the report on Europeana - the next steps."
"Europeana, by combining the resources of Europe's national digital libraries, has become a digital access point to the cultural and scientific heritage of humanity."
"The project has been endorsed by the Polish Librarians' Association."
"Effective realisation of the project requires stable financial resources, which will guarantee the participation of national libraries and universal access to Europeana's resources."
"Currently, only 5% of Europe's cultural heritage is available in digitised form."
"Almost half (47%) of this comes from France, 6% from Germany and 5% each from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom."
"The project assumes that from June 2010, 10 million digitised objects will be available, and 15 million in 2011. To make this possible, it is necessary to increase funding for the digitisation of cultural products, while ensuring close cooperation between rights-holders, cultural institutions and the public and private sector."
"In order for as many people as possible to be able to use Europeana, materials must be available in all the official languages of the European Union."
"An information campaign is needed to heighten awareness of Europeana."
"The portal must also take into account the needs of disabled people, who should be able to get full access to Europe's collective knowledge."
"To this end, the European Commission and individual publishers should ensure that disabled people are provided with special digital versions of works, such as audio readings."
"in writing. - (PL) I think opening the Europeana multimedia Internet library is an extremely significant step in the process of digitising the cultural heritage of Europe and the world."
"This is why I endorsed Mrs TrÃ¼pel's report."
"The project makes available over four and a half million books, films, maps, magazines, photographs and pieces of music, and is an archive which stores, for future generations, material first recorded on paper, canvas or parchment."
"This is extremely valuable both for ordinary citizens and for researchers, as it facilitates access to rare and difficult to obtain works."
"A major barrier to the further development of Europeana is the existence of different copyright regulations in different Member States."
"We should strive to harmonise the law in order to make as many works available to the citizens as possible, while also ensuring a fair deal for the authors."
"The success of the project will depend to a large extent on the continued financial commitment of Member States."
"I abstained from voting on the alternative resolution on Europeana - the next steps because this resolution was tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in spite of the vote that took place in committee."
"The new resolution reproduces a large part of the initial resolution and therefore incorporates the amendments that I had tabled and which were adopted, but the new text aims, above all, to deny citizens the means to add content to Europeana through a special space and the prospect of developing Web 2.0 tools."
"I therefore refused to support this move on both form and content."
"I voted for this report because it urges the European Commission to assess the application of the animal welfare action plan that is currently in force (2006-2010) and draw up another action plan for 2011-2015."
"There is also provision in this report for the establishment of a tighter monitoring system and more effective punishments for the owners of animals who do not respect the welfare requirements established by law and for the compensation of European farmers for the additional production costs associated with higher welfare standards; it also argues that the financing of these measures should be incorporated into the grants scheme of the new common agricultural policy from 2013."
"The next action plan must focus on a general European animal welfare law, on a European centre for animal welfare and animal health, on better enforcement of existing legislation, on the relationship between animal health and public health, and on new technologies."
"I believe that progress has been made on animal welfare through the implementation of the Action Plan 2006-2010, as the majority of measures featuring in this plan have been implemented in a satisfactory manner."
"As a member of the committee which monitors public health and food safety, I particularly welcomed the measures taken to reduce the harmful effects which the use of antibiotics in animal nutrition has on human health, following the ban on them in 2006."
"These are further reasons why I voted for this report."
"However, I wish to emphasise that the future action plan should include more measures aimed at supporting EU farmers and at improving the enforcement of current regulations on animal transport in Member States."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010."
"The health of animals and livestock is important to the people of Europe, to the European agricultural sector and to the European economy."
"I welcome the report's recommendation that there should be greater emphasis in the Action Plan on enforcing the legislation which is already in place."
"Certainly, the implementation of European rules and penalty systems in relation to animal welfare must be improved to ensure that there is a satisfactory minimum standard of animal welfare in the European Union."
"European producers and farmers have high standards."
"I agree with the report's assertion that it must be ensured that animal products, such as meat, which are imported into the European Union comply with the same animal welfare conditions so that there is fair competition and a level playing field for all participants in the market."
"I voted for this report, since it is particularly important to implement European animal welfare policy and legislation to establish common EU animal welfare standards."
"Good animal health and good livestock farming are important not only for animal welfare, but also for public health as a whole."
"Given that, under EU legislation, all animals are regarded as sentient beings, we must tighten animal welfare checks and adhere to animal protection standards."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has not yet prepared a concrete strategy relating to animal welfare standards and has limited itself to the report presented in October 2009."
"I agree with the European Parliament's call for the Commission to prepare a new Action Plan 2011-2015 and allocate necessary funding."
"The European Union budget must include sufficient appropriations to enable the Commission to perform its monitoring tasks, to support producers where necessary and to counter the loss of competitiveness faced by producers as a result of adopting new and changing animal welfare standards."
"Member States must also ensure that any violations of EU animal welfare rules result in effective penalties."
"Thus, only by tightening animal protection legislation and its implementation can we ensure animal protection and avoid animal products that do not comply with the conditions laid down by the general law being offered on the internal market."
"Whilst the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) supports animal welfare, this is a matter for the Member States and not for the EU."
"In Europe there has been and continues to be an active desire and long-standing tradition regarding decent treatment for animals."
"The good health and high-quality husbandry of livestock are also of fundamental importance for human public health."
"Strict standards compared with the rest of the world are part of the trademark of European farmers, as is the quality of their agricultural products, for example."
"For these reasons, we must make every effort to create a legal framework specifying the minimum standards valid throughout the EU for all forms of livestock husbandry."
"Only in this way will free and fair economic competition be made possible on the internal market."
"It is also necessary to demand minimum standards on the global market, in order to prevent the cattle of European livestock farmers being relocated outside the EU, to regions with lower standards."
"I welcome the rapporteur's suggestion that the higher production costs associated with stricter standards should be compensated within the framework of support under future forms of the CAP."
"However, it must be said that no further progress was made in the satellite monitoring of livestock transportation, and it is also regrettable that some European farmers are not following the approved standards, particularly in pig farming."
"It should be borne in mind that higher standards require greater financial expenditure, and therefore the decent and responsible farmers are disadvantaged on the market through the behaviour of irresponsible ones."
"For these reasons it is essential to introduce the option of adequate sanctions in case of a breach of EU regulations."
"I voted in favour of the report on evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010, which proposes that a more stringent system of supervision and more effective penalties for the owners of animals who do not respect the welfare requirements established by law be put in place."
"It is essential that European farmers be compensated under the new common agricultural policy for the higher production costs associated with more demanding animal welfare standards."
"After some hesitation, we Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote in favour of this report on animal welfare in Europe."
"We would have preferred a more ambitious approach to European animal welfare and we do not want this protection to be formulated in such a way that it prevents individual Member States from setting higher standards than those of the EU regulations."
"However, we have decided to view the report as part of a continuing process that will gradually enable these standards to be met and have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I agree with the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Jeggle, when she says that a more consistent approach to animal welfare is needed, but that does not mean that there is a need for further laws and regulations."
"Furthermore, I must make the observation - without belittling the issue of animal welfare protection - that too many regulations and standards can, in the final analysis, have negative effects on the market."
"It must not be forgotten that the more standards there are, the more difficult it is for producers to comply with them and the less competitive livestock farming in Europe becomes."
"Moreover, the excessive protection of animals must not make us forget other values that are equally important and that it is important to preserve, such as economic competitiveness, the sustainability of arable and livestock farming, and even some national traditions."
"On the other hand, however, human health must be protected from diseases transmitted by animals (whether wild animals, pets, or animals for human consumption), and this requires scientific research to show us how to better regulate and protect public health."
"A high level of animal welfare from breeding to slaughter can improve product safety and quality."
"European standards in this area are some of the highest in the world."
"However, compliance with these standards must not put European producers at a disadvantage in the European market."
"The truth is that these standards entail operating, financial and administrative costs for the EU's farmers."
"Reciprocity of standards is necessary if there is to be fair competition with regard to non-Union producers."
"Therefore, European farmers must be compensated for the higher production costs inherent to higher animal welfare standards."
"The financing of this compensation must consist of new common agricultural policy grant schemes from 2013 onwards."
"I would stress that European policy on the protection of animals has to be accompanied by a consistent trade policy."
"I would highlight the fact that there was no mention of animal welfare issues in the framework agreement of July 2004, or in any other of the key documents of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"Further animal welfare standards that have negative effects on the competitiveness of producers must not, therefore, be introduced until our trade partners in the WTO sign up to them."
"There are several significant aspects of the adopted report that are positive: first, the need to regulate imports and ensure that all animals and meat imported from third countries meet the same welfare requirements as are applied in the EU; second, the need to adequately cover the additional costs resulting from animal welfare promotion; third, recognition of the limited investment capacity of many small and medium-sized producers, damaged by the unfair way in which the food supply chain works; and, lastly, the proposal for incentives for the regional breeding, marketing and slaughter of animals in order to obviate the need for animals to be transported over long distances for rearing or slaughter."
"Unfortunately, the report fails to acknowledge that the current common agricultural policy (CAP) promotes and favours intensive production models, which are frequently incompatible with animal welfare and health."
"It could and should have gone further, by criticising the current CAP, rejecting its productivism and arguing for a new agricultural policy."
"Moreover, it makes proposals that are unrealistic and barely feasible, such as the development of a satellite system for monitoring the transporting of animals."
"I have two comments with regard to this report."
"Even if the rapporteur does not entirely follow through with her logic, it is refreshing to see that this Parliament is finally becoming aware of a number of problems."
"The imposition of legitimate rules on our own producers and breeders penalises them in a global ultra-free-trade system where the WTO considers social, environmental or other concerns to be non-tariff barriers to trade."
"Need I remind anyone that this same Parliament has always prioritised trade and that it is therefore jointly responsible for this situation?"
"I am equally surprised by the fact that there has been no mention of the legislative regressions imposed by the Commission, in particular with regard to organic production, which impact not only on the quality of products, but also on animal welfare and human health."
"Secondly, it is time to acknowledge that respect, and I quote, 'for customs relating in particular to religious rites and cultural traditions' may go against these standards that you claim to defend and against truly European traditions and practices."
"It is unacceptable that some foreign communities can insist, on that basis, on cruel methods of slaughter, and even recommend that EU regulations be breached in this area."
"The Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on animal welfare in the EU."
"We support an ambitious animal welfare policy that increases the degree to which animal welfare is taken into account in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - possibly in the form of a system of positive incentives."
"However, we are not in favour of the automatic assignment of new funds to the European agricultural sector as a result of financial loss associated with the consideration of animal welfare."
"in writing. - (PL) I think animal welfare is a priority which has a huge influence on public health and the European economy."
"Rapid and efficient implementation of consistent legislation in this area is essential, as well as establishment of an institution which will coordinate animal welfare."
"At present, the existing Community Action Plan has been implemented to a satisfactory degree, but in the future it will be necessary to pay greater attention to the matter of the transport and monitoring of animals."
"We need to strive to reduce differences between current levels of animal welfare standards in different countries of the Union, because at present there are large disparities in the living conditions of animals and there is growing destabilisation in livestock markets."
"I welcome the fact that Europe has achieved one of the highest levels in the world in this area."
"The creation of a tighter monitoring system and more effective punishments for the owners of animals who do not respect the welfare requirements established by law is essential, but as such measures incur higher costs for farmers, we are in favour of the compensation grants that are included in this plan and are included in the grants scheme of the new common agricultural policy from 2013."
"It is important to stress that, alongside this plan, the EU should impose strict and well-defined rules for other countries that do not respect these standards, and so become unfair competition for EU farmers."
"For years the EU has been trying to attain standardised directives on matters relating to animal husbandry."
"Progress has been made in the area of intensive livestock farming in particular, but there is still work to be done."
"In any case, it makes sense to continue with the Action Plan; particularly in connection with the enforcement of existing laws and directives."
"In this regard, mention clearly needs to be made once again of the problem of dogs being imported from the East, in respect of which not all of the loopholes in the existing regulations have yet been closed."
"Sick and neglected animals, most taken far too early from their mothers, are transported to the West in the most deplorable conditions to be sold here for a lot of money."
"This report should be seen as a positive step in the right direction and that is why I have voted in favour of it."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's own-initiative report on evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan (the Paulsen report), because I fully support the objective of strengthening animal welfare in the EU."
"However, it is not clear in the report whether the EU is to establish maximum harmonisation in this area."
"I would not under any circumstances be able to support a future proposal that prevented Member States from producing better mandatory standards for animal welfare than the standards that we are able to agree on at EU level."
"On the contrary, I believe that it is vital for the continued pursuit of better animal welfare that it is possible for Member States to lead the way in this area."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted in favour of Mrs Paulsen's report on animal welfare legislation."
"However, I should like to point out that it is important for this legislation to represent minimum standards."
"The Member States and the regions must have the opportunity to implement more far-reaching animal welfare legislation."
"The report on which we voted today assesses, objectively and critically, the results of the Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010 and sets realistic and necessary targets for the growth - in the sense of progress - of food production and consumption in the European Union."
"One point that I would highlight is the recognition that better quality products means increased costs for producers, especially primary producers, which does not normally mean increased commercial demand, since only a minority of consumers will choose more expensive products."
"The report therefore emphasises the need to compensate these same producers for their efforts."
"The intention to impose the regulations applicable to EU products on the products of third countries should also be noted, as it ensures fair and balanced competition in trade."
"Finally, it seems important to me to make the argument for creating a European coordinating body and adopting general and common legislation, in order to harmonise best practices and establish supervision mechanisms."
"Whilst the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) supports animal welfare, this is a matter for the Member States and not for the EU."
"Today, we have adopted an important resolution which assesses the European Commission's Animal Welfare Action Plan 2006-2010."
"High standards of animal health are required not only by arguments of an ethical nature, but also by concern for the safety and quality of animal products, and this undoubtedly engenders a positive, reliable European agricultural brand."
"in writing. - Whilst we support measures to manage and protect European forests, we do not support the creation of a new European forestry policy that would transfer powers in this area to the European Union."
"The report also refers to the Soil Directive, legislation that the British Conservative Delegation opposes, as soil can be best managed by Member States, because applying the same rules on all soil from Northern Finland to Southern Greece will not bring any benefit to farmers in the UK."
"UK farmers already meet very high voluntary standards of soil management and have continued to improve standards."
"The Soil Directive as proposed by the European Commission was flawed in many aspects and would only bring more regulation, more cost and less flexibility to British farmers, who we believe know better than European bureaucrats how to manage their own land."
"In my opinion, the report on EU agriculture and climate change has the essential quality of combining protection of the environment with the promotion of a stronger European agricultural sector."
"Indeed, the agricultural sector must move resolutely towards means of production that are more respectful of the environment and more sustainable."
"Nevertheless, these objectives absolutely must not be a pretext for weakening agriculture in the EU."
"To ensure this, we must guarantee better use of resources and product traceability."
"I therefore voted for this report because it respects these balances."
"in writing. - I gave my full support to this report."
"The upcoming CAP reform will have to take into account many issues, including climate change."
"It is already clear that climate change will have a negative impact on EU agriculture, especially in the south and south-east regions."
"The new CAP, thus, will have to meet growing public demand for a more sustainable agricultural policy."
"For the time being, the CAP does not address environmental issues in a consistent manner."
"The new challenges of climate change, water management, renewable energies and biodiversity were not fully taken on board at the time of the CAP health check."
"I am certain that the CAP must be turned into an agricultural , food and environment policy with fairer and more sustainable farmer support systems while ensuring the preservation of rural areas, biodiversity conservation , carbon capture and food security."
"The common agricultural policy is a key area in the fight against climate change in the coming years."
"As such, the report presented by Mr Le Foll prudently places the climate issue at the heart of the CAP."
"Agriculture is dealt a double blow by climate change."
"It is the first to suffer the increase in droughts and natural disasters."
"However, it is also behind 9% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe."
"The European Parliament is showing that virtuous courses of action are within our reach."
"Nitrogen fertilisers used by farmers are significant emitters of CO2."
"By targeting their use, by promoting fertilisers based on organic waste and by emphasising organic farming, we will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Methane from animal faeces is also a renewable source of energy."
"Moreover, European forests and soil are both incredible reservoirs of CO2."
"The European Union is the world's largest importer of agricultural produce, but I also welcome the encouragement given to internal production with minimal impact on climate change."
"The conclusions from the report debated on Wednesday in the European Parliament highlight to us that importing agricultural produce from third countries has a much greater detrimental impact on the environment than internal production, which is subject to stricter regulations on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, making it conducive to climate change."
"Agriculture has been and will remain the main source of food globally."
"According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, agricultural production needs to grow by 70% in the next 40 years in order to meet the world population's needs."
"The European Union must start devising policies or urgently implement existing policies in order to avert a long-term crisis."
"These policies must be backed up by ambitious targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions with an adverse environmental impact because we are going round in a vicious circle."
"According to the experts, agriculture which is carried out with a disregard for its environmental impact will cause global warming, which will lead to major problems, even in terms of carrying out agriculture in the long term."
"European agriculture contributes to achieving the Union's climate change mitigation objectives for 2020."
"Greenhouse gas emissions have been decreasing as a result of the increased efficiency of EU agriculture, constant innovations, the use of new techniques such as CO2 storage in the soil, and developments in the production of sustainable, renewable energies."
"Innovation therefore has a major role to play in reducing the impact agriculture has on climate change and its environmental consequences."
"I call for European funds from the agricultural sector to be used to develop technology to adapt this sector for the fight against climate change."
"The role of agriculture in the process of fighting climate change must take into consideration the competitive position of the EU's agri-foodstuffs sector in the world market, so solutions must be found that allow conventional agriculture to contribute to the sustainable management of the environment, while at the same time protecting it from speculation on foodstuffs in the commodities market and the protectionism of international trade."
"The Democratic Movement delegation in the European Parliament welcomes the adoption of the report on EU agriculture and climate change."
"It approves of the fact that emphasis is being placed on the new challenges that the common agricultural policy will have to face, such as climate change, the question of water, renewable energies and biodiversity, and soil management (carbon capture, the retention capacity of water and of mineral elements, biological life, and so on)."
"In the same spirit the Democratic Movement delegation wanted a common European forestry policy to be established in order to promote sustainable forest management and production and to turn the contributions of the timber industry and its economic development to better account."
"These are all essential issues."
"There will have to be a place for them in future agricultural policy."
"I voted in favour of the report on EU agriculture and climate change because it puts forward specific measures that can contribute to making agriculture more sustainable."
"Agriculture is one of the activities most affected by climate change, but also one of the biggest contributors to CO2 emissions."
"The forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy must incentivise the development of practices that allow European agriculture to be better adapted to the consequences of climate change whilst also contributing to slowing it down."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted against the part of the report that calls for a common forestry policy in the EU."
"We believe that the Member States should continue to make the decisions on matters relating to forestry policy."
"Agriculture is responsible for 9.3% of the European Union's total CO2 emissions, whereas in 1990 it represented 11% of those emissions."
"A constant and progressive decrease in greenhouse gas emissions has been seen, and agriculture has made a positive contribution to meeting the targets for decreased emissions set by the European Union."
"Moreover, I must point out that, whilst environmental concerns as regards the agricultural sector are legitimate and necessary, they must be duly weighed against the impact of the proposals in terms of agricultural sustainability and productivity."
"For that very reason, the reform of the common agricultural policy needs to look carefully at the relationship between agriculture and environmental protection, without forgetting that, apart from its negative impact on the environment (resulting, specifically, from CO2 emissions), agriculture makes a decisive contribution to the preservation and management of natural resources, to green growth, and to landscape and biodiversity management."
"These are beneficial side effects of agriculture, which must be duly taken into account in any proposal to examine the relationship between agriculture and the environment."
"Agriculture is directly involved in the climate change issue, since it contributes part of the greenhouse gases emitted and is, at the same time, itself affected by climate change."
"The negative impact of climate change is already being felt, with drought and soil erosion causing major problems, especially in the southern Member States."
"However, agriculture can also contribute to combating climate change and has great potential for sustainable development."
"The common agricultural policy must, therefore, encourage farming practices that limit emissions and/or improve carbon fixation, since agriculture and forestry are the main economic sectors able to capture the CO2 produced by human activities, accumulating and storing it in the soil."
"We need to move towards more sustainable agriculture, which means greater efficiency."
"According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, a 70% increase in world food production will also be needed by 2050 in order to handle the increase in world population."
"We will have to produce more, but in a sustainable way, which requires greater efficiency, the adoption of the best techniques and practices, and increased investment in scientific research for this area."
"Consideration of the implications of climate change for agriculture is a relevant concern, just as it is relevant, entirely justified and necessary to make farming more compatible with the preservation of a series of things of natural and cultural value, such as soils, landscape and biodiversity."
"Nevertheless, these concerns must not lead us to forget that agriculture's main role is to produce food, nor must they serve as a pretext for making amendments to the common agricultural policy (CAP) that worsen the already serious and unacceptable food dependency of various countries, both Member States - as is the case of Portugal - and third countries."
"Such dependency threatens the food sovereignty and security of these countries' peoples in the name of an allegedly untouchable 'competitive position of the EU's agri-foodstuffs sector in the world market'."
"It would have been important for this report to devote even just a few lines to the need to break with the productivist model that has shaped successive reforms of the CAP and to its tragic social and environmental consequences; unfortunately, not one word on this was included."
"It would also have been important for it to avoid any ambiguity at a time when we are confronting attempts by the European Commission to impose the interests of agribusiness multinationals regarding the spread of genetically modified crops."
"I supported the report by my French socialist colleague Mr Le Foll since it defends the idea that European agriculture must continue to adapt, as it has already begun to do, to the consequences of the changes in climate taking place and to prepare for the impact that these changes will have in future for many regions of the European Union."
"Agriculture actually has a crucial place and a role to play in the fight against global warming."
"This is an essential issue when it comes to ensuring food security and to embarking on the road to sustainability."
"In this context the post-2013 CAP must inevitably integrate this 'climate' dimension by providing solutions and assistance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by encouraging carbon storage in the ground, by developing the production of sustainable renewable energies and by maximising the function of photosynthesis."
"The Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on agriculture and climate change."
"We support an ambitious agricultural policy that equips the European agricultural sector to cope with climate change, but we are not in favour of new funds being assigned to European agricultural policy."
"On the question of climate change, agriculture should not be treated as a branch of the economy which is harmful."
"Quite the opposite, it should be treated as an industry which possesses not only the best possibilities for adapting to changes in the ecosystem, but as one which positively enables the harmful effects of global warming to be combated effectively."
"A significant reduction in the level of CO2 emissions in agriculture is now being seen in comparison with previous decades."
"Investment in rural development, and so the second pillar of the CAP, will enable better education of farmers, technological modernisation of farms and also suitable supervision and control of the environment and biodiversity conservation."
"Appropriate management of farms will result in carbon capture and greater food security."
"Innovative research and appropriate investment under the CAP will help agriculture become a powerful tool in the fight against climate change and pollution of the atmosphere."
"This report supports productivism and liberalism, which goes against the general interest. That depends on respect for human beings and for our ecosystem."
"Productivism and capitalism do not invite either."
"Nonetheless, the preference given to short circuits (although they are not described as such), the priority given to renewable energy sources, the review of costly irrigation systems or even the mitigation of the effects of climate change being described as a 'public good' are too many concessions to our arguments to be ignored."
"Climate change has gradually become a reality that we are all going to have to face up to as a priority for EU policy."
"The climate change phenomenon damages agriculture, which, according to recently published reports, points to a very discouraging outlook for this sector."
"It will apparently be the countries of Southern Europe, above all, that are hardest hit by climate change."
"It is essential that the common agricultural policy take appropriate action in response to climate change, promoting better resource management."
"The optimisation of water resources, the choosing of crop varieties selected for their resistance to climate change and diseases, the protection of soil from erosion, the preservation of pastures, increased forestation, the restoration of damaged areas, better management of forests in such a way as to limit the risk of fire, and new measures to monitor and control disease are all extremely important measures to adapt European agriculture to the effects of global warming."
"Farmers will be increasingly dependent on the state of the climate, so we approve of any measures that resolve this problem."
"I voted for this report as I believe that agriculture is a production sector which is affected by the consequences of climate change and exposed to the pressure exerted by this."
"At the same time, however, it is directly associated with the objectives for mitigating the impact of climate change, whether by helping to cut greenhouse gas emissions, retain and ensure satisfactory management of water resources, or by boosting production and decentralising sustainable, renewable energy sources."
"In this respect, the Eastern European states with highly developed agricultural sectors can benefit fully from the development of the biofuels industry, thereby contributing to the growth of incomes in rural areas and the creation of 'green' jobs (for example, it is envisaged that 750 000 jobs relating to renewable energy sources will be created in the agricultural sector by 2020)."
"All initiatives that aim to reduce global warming are welcome."
"This follows on from what took place yesterday in the European Parliament, where 1 500 elected officials from major European towns committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20% by 2020."
"Today's adoption of the Le Foll report on adapting European agriculture to climate change goes along with this approach."
"Let us not forget that the agricultural sector is responsible for almost 10% of CO2 emissions."
"Agriculture has much to gain by anticipating the harmful effects of climate change as far as flooded areas, a decrease in farming areas, deforestation and unpredictable returns are concerned."
"It is therefore necessary to build on the sustainable aspect of agriculture."
"Promoting reasonable use of fertilisers and pesticides, combined with diversifying agricultural production and livestock farming, will guarantee farmers far more autonomy and an improved capital base."
"Clearly, European agriculture must play a major role in combating climate change."
"There are several possibilities: the use of carbon sinks, a renewable energy supply and new irrigation techniques."
"All that remains is for these ideas to be transformed into concrete policies and to incorporate them into the reformed CAP of 2013."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted against this report. The reason for this is that Mr Le Foll advocates a common forestry policy."
"Forestry policy is a national matter: there are very large differences between the EU Member States."
"I also believe that, apart from cross-border environmental issues, it is not appropriate for agricultural policy to be decided at Union level, particularly after enlargement of the EU to 27 countries."
"However, as long as the EU's common agricultural policy exists, I want the decisions to be as good as possible with the clear purpose of tackling climate change."
"I have great sympathy for many of Mr Le Foll's proposals for tackling the climate threat, the key issue of our time, but recommending a common forestry policy is the wrong way to go."
"in writing. - For the record: as a chief whip of the PPE Group, I hereby state that the PPE Group's original intention was to vote against paragraph 18/2 (roll-call vote)."
"A technical error was made by the group."
"I voted in favour of StÃ©phane Le Foll's report."
"I did so because I am convinced of the significant role agriculture will play in the problems associated with tackling global warming."
"Our agriculture will assist the European Union in meeting its objectives to reduce emissions."
"I welcome the adoption of paragraphs 18 and 20 concerning respect for and improvement of the quality of soil with carbon fixing and the use of biomass for heating, which might significantly reduce the harmful impact of climate change."
"I am resolutely confident that the CAP will become more sustainable over time."
"I support an environmentally friendly common agricultural policy!"
"Climate change may affect agriculture: there may be water shortages, new diseases may appear and livestock may overheat."
"Agriculture can help slow climate change, but it should also be ready to adapt to the impact of global warming."
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) must acknowledge the impact of global warming and take measures to reduce climate change."
"This can be achieved by promoting clean and renewable energy, by providing geological storage of carbon dioxide and by limiting the amount of gas emissions causing the greenhouse effect."
"However, the costs associated with adapting the CAP and reducing climate change are not yet clear."
"There needs to be a thorough analysis of the economic benefit."
"Climate change is a real threat, but in the short term better management of resources is required."
"EU expansion had a great impact on EU agriculture."
"The 6 million farmers of the existing EU were joined by another 7 million farmers."
"Rural areas account for 90% of the EU's territory, and more than half of these are involved in farming."
"This fact alone underlines the importance of farming to the EU's natural environment."
"At the Warsaw Conference in February 2010, Lithuania and another eight EU Member States signed a declaration on the new CAP, as a further expression of solidarity and decency."
"We must not divide Europe into 'new' and 'old' Member States; we must show solidarity."
"In order to guarantee a stable and fair income for European farmers post 2013 and to reduce climate change we need a strong European agricultural policy."
"I voted in favour of this excellent report by the Italian, Mr Dorfmann, on the process begun by the European Commission to revise the criteria for granting the status of 'agricultural area with natural handicaps' and, therefore, the Compensatory Allowance for Permanent Natural Handicaps (ICHN)."
"In particular we should stress the importance of paragraph 18 of this report, which already refuses to support the criteria proposed by the European Commission: 'emphasises that a final opinion on the basic territorial unit chosen, the criteria and the threshold values proposed by the Commission can only be given when the detailed maps drawn up by the Member States are available [...]'."
"I voted in favour of the Dorfmann report on farming in areas with natural handicaps (Less-Favoured Areas)."
"Roughly 75% of land in Ireland has been designated as disadvantaged areas, and the current scheme provides aid to roughly 100 000 farming families."
"This scheme is necessary for rural viability and development, and to combat land abandonment, as well as to protect biodiversity and the environment."
"With the correct funding, this scheme can give income aid to farmers who are farming in very difficult conditions."
"As farming in Ireland is restricted due to cold, wet weather conditions, I am pleased to see that the report makes reference to difficulties related to farming on unworkable, wet soils."
"I also welcome the reference to 'field capacity days', which helps to take into consideration the interaction between the type of soil and the climate."
"I believe that the application of uniform criteria will simplify the implementation of the payments scheme for areas with natural handicaps across the European Union, providing greater transparency and uniform treatment for the beneficiaries of these support schemes."
"It is absolutely paramount to focus this support in the areas most affected by land abandonment."
"At the same time, the following criteria must be taken into account as part of the exercise: no additional costs must be incurred and consideration must be given to the impact which the change in delimitation will have in areas where agriculture plays a key role in the local economy."
"In this respect, I think that it is appropriate to have measures in place in the areas affected by changes in delimitation, which are aimed at boosting the agricultural sector's competitiveness and promoting diversification."
"The report on support for disadvantaged rural regions has the aim of redefining the disadvantaged areas of the EU and reforming their financial and structural assistance."
"Member States have previously identified as disadvantaged more than half of all land used for agriculture in the EU, and it is therefore essential to redefine the concepts and conditions applying to such land."
"Support for rural development from the European Agriculture Fund allows Member States, within the framework of improvements to the environment and the countryside, to make payments for natural disadvantages in mountain areas as well as payments in other disadvantaged areas."
"These payments should, through the permanent use of agricultural land, contribute towards the preservation of the countryside and support for sustainable systems of agriculture, and should compensate for additional costs and lost earnings."
"Research has shown that Member States identify temporarily disadvantaged areas on the basis of a range of different criteria, and these can lead to varying responses and varying levels of payment between the different Member States."
"I therefore welcome the rapporteur's suggestion to leave some room to Member States to review the new criteria before commencing payments."
"However, there should be a time limit placed on this, as the entire reform process may be greatly delayed through the apathy of some Member States, which would not only have a negative effect on payments from these funds, but would also contribute to a confused legal environment in individual Member States."
"I support the entire report."
"Aid for less-favoured rural areas is an essential element of the second pillar of the common agricultural policy (rural development policy), as it is natural that regions with natural disadvantages should be targeted by specific tools and policies."
"The Commission is proposing in this communication that, according to Article 50(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, the 'other less-favoured areas' be defined in accordance with objective criteria."
"For this purpose, it is proposing eight soil and climate criteria indicating, at a certain threshold value, severe limitations for European agriculture: climate criteria (long-term low temperature or heat stress), biophysical criteria (poorly drained soil; stony, sandy or clay soil; low rooting depth; salty soil) and geographic criteria (areas with very unfavourable moisture balance or steep slopes)."
"This definition of objective criteria is positive, but they must be tested on the ground to verify their reliability and adaptability to real situations and the specific characteristics of each natural area."
"The possibility of a transitional period, with its own scheme, for any region that loses its classification as a less-favoured area must also be considered."
"Support for less-favoured rural areas constitutes an essential element of rural development policy."
"I advocate the awarding of adequate compensation payments to less-favoured areas so that farmers help to preserve the rural environment and take up sustainable agriculture that provides public goods, such as landscapes, quality of water and air, and the preservation of biodiversity."
"This aid allows social and territorial cohesion, preserving rural areas and gives them the status of an area of vital economic and natural importance."
"It is criteria relating to 'other areas with natural handicaps', pursuant to Article 50(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, that are in question in this report."
"A panel of experts identified eight soil and climate criteria indicating, at a certain threshold value, severe limitations for European agriculture."
"I agree that that the geographical criterion referred to as 'isolation' must also be taken into account, as it is a natural handicap."
"I hope that the Member States can apply objective soil criteria that are adapted to the conditions of their natural area when designating areas with natural handicaps."
"It is positive that there is a belief that 'LFA payments must be linked to active farming of the land' and that 'strict and purely biophysical criteria may not be suitable'."
"We also see as valuable the inclusion of the geographic criterion 'isolation' and the statement that 'the cumulative use of the adopted criteria might prove necessary'."
"However, these aspects contradict others included in the report, specifically the definition of a 'transitional period' for adapting to the new criteria; in other words, tacit acceptance of the new criteria proposed by the Commission."
"We are utterly opposed to the reflection of the new criteria in the future development of the common agricultural policy (CAP), as is also being argued there, so keeping this policy in the sphere of rural development with cofinancing; in other words, retaining another way of discriminating between countries."
"If implemented, the Commission's proposal would be extremely damaging to the interests of the southern countries, particularly Portugal."
"That is why we are warning of the need when drawing up the CAP to correct this proposal and to demonstrate and assess the use not just of the set of biophysical criteria, but of socioeconomic ones as well, such as: GDP per capita, income per family labour unit and desertification indicators."
"This report emphasises the importance that the new common agricultural policy will have for all Member States."
"The safeguarding of areas with natural handicaps will be one of the main points of this policy that the EU and the regions of the Member States will be implementing, thereby putting subsidiarity into effect in practical terms."
"The EU Commission must take this subsidiarity into account, especially when it comes to identifying the parameters that will define these areas."
"The Commission must not neglect the fact that the recovery of areas with natural handicaps will provide tangible help for farms affected by the current major crisis, and will help to keep the environment in good condition."
"May I remind you that all this must be possible not just in theory, but also in reality, through the allocation of appropriate funds for safeguarding and redeveloping these areas."
"In doing this, we could recover and provide incentives for the economic development of agriculture in all areas with potential for growth and determine knock-on effects in the market, such as the agricultural production of foodstuffs typical of the area, and safeguarding of the landscape and the environment."
"I thank Mr Dorfmann and congratulate him on his excellent report."
"In order to achieve fair and uniform conditions for all farmers in the European Union, which should, unquestionably, be the main objective of reform of the common agricultural policy, care should also be taken over areas with natural handicaps."
"In order to harmonise the legislation which classifies areas as eligible to receive payments it is essential, above all, to harmonise the classification criteria of such areas."
"Achieving this objective will not be possible without close cooperation with Member States."
"The pragmatism proposed by the author of the report in allowing biophysical criteria to be defined by individual countries may pose a threat in the form of attempts to impose particular national interests."
"However, as long as the Commission takes care to ensure that European legislative framework provisions are observed, this solution should significantly improve objective identification of the areas under discussion."
"Considering that more than half of the utilised agricultural area in the EU (54%) is classed as less-favoured areas - whether because of orography, climatic conditions or less fertile land - and that such a measure is essential to rural development, we conclude that aid for less-favoured areas must constitute a priority for the Member States."
"For this reason, the preparation of a comprehensive strategy for less-favoured areas that meets the local needs of the various regions will lead to a reduction in the existing disparity between Member States as regards the aid that is awarded to them."
"Therefore, by exactly defining the areas with natural handicaps, it will be possible to obtain sufficient funds to make use of the land and improve agricultural output."
"There is no doubt that farms in the outermost regions are in particular need of financial support."
"Small mountain farms often have to fight to survive, as it is scarcely possible for them to react quickly to new market requirements."
"Smallholders in particular lack the staff to be able to remain competitive."
"Consequently, from a business point of view alone, their situation is much more difficult than that of large agricultural undertakings in exposed locations."
"The high rate of farms going under in the past few years and the increase in part-time farmers clearly show that the EU subsidy policy focuses far too heavily on intensive livestock farming and the like."
"In order for the EU Member States to remain even remotely self-sufficient, it is high time we renationalised our farming subsidies."
"With a view to a fairer distribution of compensation payments, I have voted in favour of this report."
"I voted for this report, which tackles the problems facing farmers in many EU Member States."
"I would like to emphasise in particular the importance of an amendment which I tabled in committee, and I wish to thank my colleagues who supported it."
"The aim of the amendment I am alluding to is to ensure that the way in which areas with natural handicaps are delimited is relevant by basing it on homogeneous ecological zones rather than on LAU 2, as is the case at the moment."
"I also wish to point out that I feel that it is appropriate to include in the Commission's future proposal flexible rules which also allow aid to be granted to farmers in zones with natural handicaps with a small area, located from an administrative perspective in units which do not meet the established criteria."
"Support for rural areas with challenging natural handicaps is one of the most important components of the second pillar of the common agricultural policy."
"In addition, the report provides for subsidies for these regions not only in respect of food production, but also in a macro-economic context."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution, because the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, namely rural development policy, is extremely important for improving the effectiveness of the CAP itself, but also for facilitating the management of land which has natural handicaps."
"The document drafted by the rapporteur is very necessary, not only for us, but for the whole of the European Union."
"We must have information about land which, for reasons not dependent on the owners, cannot be used effectively or well."
"I agree with the rapporteur in his assessment of the review, which began in 2005, of criteria for classifying disadvantaged areas."
"The previous criteria for support of these areas must be modified so that they reflect actually existing handicaps."
"It should also be remembered that there are areas which come under specific criteria but where the handicaps have now been removed due to the use of effective solutions."
"It is Member States which should be responsible for identification of less-favoured areas and for development of aid and development programmes."
"Of course, all measures must be based on an EU framework."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report, together with my group."
"I abstained/voted against the Dorfmann report."
"The reason for me taking this position is evident from the report."
"The EU is far too large an area to be able to handle agricultural aid efficiently for areas with natural handicaps."
"The EU's rural areas are extremely diverse. This is the case with regard to the crops that are cultivated, moisture levels in the soil, combinations of soil types and climate conditions."
"Climate change makes it particularly difficult to draw up a list of criteria and fixed standards for subsidies."
"The EU has requested detailed maps from the Member States, but only a few countries have supplied them."
"One example that is highlighted in the report by the Court of Auditors is that Spain pays out EUR 16 per hectare whereas Malta pays out EUR 250 per hectare for what are understood to be similar circumstances."
"The common agricultural policy was drawn up when the EC/EU had six Member States."
"The situation today is completely different and even more complicated."
"The management of agricultural aid should be handled by the Member States."
"They have the local knowledge."
"We are currently in the midst of a crisis for the euro."
"A single currency is an obstacle to adapting interest rates and currencies to different circumstances within the euro area."
"A single agricultural policy is equally inappropriate for all 27 Member States."
"In this communication, the Commission has sought greater rigour and uniformity in the criteria for apportioning aid to farmers in areas with natural handicaps."
"It has also attempted to correct the uneven apportioning of compensatory payments among Member States resulting from differences in classification, especially of the so-called 'intermediate less-favoured areas (LFAs)'."
"These payments are crucial to the preservation of employment and rural communities, to the continued use of farmland, and to biodiversity and the cultural landscape."
"I am generally satisfied with the report and especially with the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, which is attempting to safeguard the interests of the outermost regions, since the islands are excluded from the Commission's communication."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it seems logical to me that, when identifying intermediate LFAs, the Member States be allowed to take into account not only biophysical criteria but also others, such as being an island or an outermost region."
"It also seems important to me that any region that loses its status as an 'area with natural handicaps' should benefit from a transitional period, enabling it to lessen the impact of losing its subsidies."
"We must now ensure that, in the general review of the common agricultural policy, the new aid schemes for farmers are thought out in a consistent way and that there is better coordination between agricultural policy and cohesion policy."
"I voted for this report on a new Digital Agenda for Europe: 2015.eu, as I believe that Europe needs to play a leading role in promoting innovation in the information and communications technology sector."
"This is why we need to speed up the investments towards this."
"Unfortunately, at the moment Europe is at risk of lagging behind Asia, just judging by a few indicators, such as average data transfer rate or the fact that, although broadband communication services are available to more than 90% of the European Union's population, they have only reached consumers in 50% of households."
"The Commission must present a clear, ambitious agenda in this area, which takes the form of more than just a vision or a prospects document."
"There are solutions which we must support, such as the use of open source programs, which would help speed up software innovation through open contributions and cut costs for businesses using these programs."
"At the same time, we must adopt measures aimed at reducing the red tape within the EU framework programme and at boosting our competitiveness globally."
"The own-initiative report by Mrs del Castillo Vera is ambitious where the issue of the digital strategy for Europe is concerned. This matter revolves around Internet access for all citizens of the EU."
"In this regard, it is recommended that half of the European population should have broadband access by 2015 and the entire population by 2020."
"This widespread use of the Internet is supported by proposals on the manner in which legislation concerning consumers and security should evolve, as well as on necessary digital access to public services."
"Moreover, this agenda will enable us to provide support for innovative research and development, thus facilitating a rapid growth in knowledge and access to heritage."
"For all these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - I voted for this report."
"I am convinced that Europe will only reap benefits of the digital revolution if all EU citizens are mobilised and empowered to participate fully in the new digital society."
"This requires many challenges, such as commitment to long-term investments, confidence by the governments to move more strongly to e-government and confidence by citizens to use the digital services."
"To attain those goals it is necessary the significantly reduce digital literacy and competence gaps by 2015."
"I especially welcome the proposals which seek to ensure that all primary and secondary schools have high speed connections by 2015 and that all adults of working age should be offered ICT training opportunities."
"In order to have a competitive digital agenda we must start from the people."
"Information and communication technologies (ICT) is one of the areas that has been developing most in recent decades, and they are present in all areas of human life."
"In an environment of permanent change and growing competitiveness, ICTs can be a powerful tool in helping sustainable development, as well as fighting poverty and social and economic inequalities."
"Each person must be empowered with the appropriate competences and ubiquitous and high-speed access, and a clear legal framework is required that protects rights and that offers the necessary trust and security."
"The report 'on a new Digital Agenda for Europe: 2015.eu', of which I voted in favour, seeks to cooperate with the Commission on drawing up the universal strategic proposal and action plan for 2015."
"To this end: every EU household must have access to broadband Internet at a competitive price by 2013; particular attention must be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps, in particular the outermost regions; and, lastly, it is important to guarantee disabled end-users access at a level equivalent to that available to other end-users."
"One of the most ambitious but unrealised objectives of the Lisbon Strategy was to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society in the world."
"The aim of adopting the 2015.eu agenda, which is complementary to the EU 2020 strategy, is to make citizens qua consumers the focus of an EU measure that aims to ensure that all Member State citizens can draw on an appropriate reserve of IT abilities to guarantee them access to the main forms of information and communication technology available today."
"The path to ensuring the computer literacy of families, students, businesses and European governments will be aided by various strategies that will deal with the issue of defining digital rights, and also implement infrastructure to improve and extend broadband, especially in rural areas."
"As I strongly believe that the future of training must necessarily go hand in hand with the enhancement of computer-based training and the interoperability of IT skills, I am in favour of the report."
"I support the excellent report on the new Digital Agenda by Mrs del Castillo Vera."
"I agree that the EU must play a leading role in creating and applying Information and Communication Technologies, thereby generating added value for its citizens and companies."
"I also agree that it will only reap the rewards of this digital revolution if the European public in its entirety is mobilised and given the means necessary to participate fully in the new digital society."
"I welcome the goal of giving broadband coverage to every European citizen and across the whole territory, including the outermost regions."
"I also welcome the recommendation that the concept of digital literacy be introduced into education systems, starting as early as the pre-primary level, in parallel with foreign languages, with the aim of producing skilled users as early as possible."
"I would highlight the potential value for citizens and businesses of the digital switchover of public services (e-government) in order to enable a more efficient and personalised provision of public services."
"I would also point out the fact that by using e-procurement systems (public works contracts) significant gains in terms of transparency and competitiveness are possible, with greater choice, higher quality and lower prices."
"I voted in favour of this report, which I endorse both in terms of its spirit and its content."
"I believe that, by adopting this report, the European Parliament has sent out a clear signal of political leadership with the creation of a digital agenda, a true coherent and comprehensive European plan, which is a fundamental step for Europe's future."
"On the one hand, digital development offers a major opportunity for growth, but, on the other, it entails major social change, with a significant impact on citizens' behaviour."
"The important thing is to ensure that this change leads to a more democratic, open and inclusive European society and to a prosperous, competitive and knowledge-based future economy."
"This can only come about if, as highlighted in the report, 'the person is placed at the core of the policy action'."
"It is important to focus closely on the growth of broadband connections and the application of digital technologies in key market sectors, such as energy, transport and health."
"This political action, however, must set out appropriate guarantees to avoid widening the gap between large enterprises and SMEs; public authorities and the private sector; densely populated areas and rural, insular and mountainous areas; and national and cross-border electronic commerce."
"I appreciate the efforts made by Mrs del Castillo Vera in drafting this report, along with the contribution made by my fellow Members."
"The Digital Agenda and the development of the single ICT market feature among our priorities and those of the Presidency."
"I welcome the emphasis which is placed in this concept on promoting digital literacy among young people, as they use new technologies the most and must do it, therefore, in a safe, efficient manner."
"I wish to thank my fellow Members for the support they have given to the action taken by me in asking the Commission to draw up a plan for promoting new online businesses and providing facilities, especially for those recently made redundant."
"I am confident that the votes from my fellow Members and I mark an important step towards a total, efficient approach to the European digital future."
"I hope that the Commission will support us in establishing clear rules in this area at both EU and Member State level."
"A 'digital agenda' is increasingly important and unavoidable in our society."
"Technological developments, especially in terms of making information, content and knowledge available online, have been extremely swift, and in little more than a decade the 'digital' landscape has changed drastically, with mass access to the Internet and mobile communications."
"It is, therefore, important to look to the future and define a strategy for the digital agenda, setting concrete goals and paying particular attention to issues relating to the rights of consumers to privacy and to personal data, as well as copyright and the fight against Internet piracy."
"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a part in a prosperous and competitive economy, and help to cement a more environmentally friendly, democratic, open and inclusive society."
"ITCs allow efficiency, helping towards sustainable growth, and so contribute to the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy."
"There are major disparities between and within the Member States in terms of potential public access to broadband at the moment."
"We urgently need to build a digital single market for services that prevents fragmented rules and contributes to the free circulation of digital services and e-commerce."
"An ambitious digital agenda and a universal action plan must be adopted, enabling Europe to progress towards an open and prosperous digital society offering all citizens economic, social and cultural opportunities, and paying particular attention to rural areas."
"I would stress the importance of offering all citizens ubiquitous and high-speed access to fixed and mobile broadband."
"National and European funds should be used to ensure that all EU citizens have access to broadband Internet at a competitive price by 2013."
"There are quite a lot of positives in this report, despite its being developed in the framework of the internal market, which the European Union advocates."
"We recognise the underlying benefits of a digital agenda for Europe included in the report, specifically the guarantee of 'access to cultural products for all citizens', the guarantee to 'disabled end-user access at a level equivalent to that available to other end-users', the readiness for 'greater investment in the use of open source software in the EU' and the assertion that 'particular attention should be paid to rural areas, areas affected by industrial transition, and regions which suffer from severe and permanent natural or demographic handicaps, in particular the outermost regions'."
"Let us contribute to these proposals."
"Nonetheless, we believe that a cutting-edge digital agenda rejects any commercialisation of knowledge, education and research."
"That is why we do not accept the watering-down of the positive goals with the ambiguities and variations of the European single market."
"Strengthening and promoting a 'well-functioning' internal market do not make it more 'consumer-oriented', nor do they lead 'to lower prices', as they are trying to make us believe."
"The reverse has been proven to be the case on various occasions, in the full range of the European Union's activities."
"That is why we abstained."
"Increased attention needs to be focused on defining a new digital agenda, 2015.eu, which is intended to be more competitive and innovative than the i2010 strategy launched recently, especially with regard to its educational and cultural aspects."
"For this reason, as rapporteur for the opinion for the Committee on Culture and Education, I supported this report, especially the points it contained relating to the role of information and communications technologies in the training of young people and preparing them for the job market."
"In the text submitted and adopted I emphasised both the importance of children acquiring a basic knowledge of ICT already from primary school level and the added value that online learning can provide to our society, which is in constant flux."
"On the same lines, I welcomed that young people are the section of the population which is most receptive to ICT."
"In fact, they need to focus on this area, as this can make an important contribution to reducing the level of unemployment in the EU, in line with the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"Last but not least, I reaffirmed the need to develop the Europeana project as part of the 2015.eu agenda, implementing it in a way which guarantees it a high profile, while also ensuring that its inherent cultural objective is met."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which will help when drafting a comprehensive 2015 strategy proposal for information and communications technologies (ICT)."
"I believe that our emergence from the economic crisis depends to a large extent on the proposal's ability to facilitate the wide-ranging and efficient application of ICT in the business sector."
"SMEs can act as the catalyst for economic recovery in Europe."
"In fact, the European Commission must strengthen in future the measures supporting SMEs in the use of ICT tools, with a view to boosting their productivity."
"I am using my vote today to support the proposal from this report on devising a Digital Plan for promoting online companies, with the primary aim of offering other options to those who have been made redundant recently in the current financial crisis."
"Such an initiative could be implemented by specifically offering free Internet connection and consultancy."
"A new digital agenda for Europe is essential in order for there to be a digital revolution from which the European public as a whole can benefit."
"However, the involvement of all citizens in this process is necessary for such a revolution; it is necessary in order for them to become actors in the new digital society."
"In order for this to become a reality, large-scale investment is needed to enable the digital divide that currently exists in the EU to be reduced."
"We cannot forget that an informed and enlightened public contributes to increasing Europe's potential."
"Making full use of information and telecommunications technology is a precondition for a more competitive Europe and for sustainable growth."
"The EU should ensure the development and application of these technologies, and enable all EU citizens to link up with the new digital society through high-quality, high-speed Internet connections at affordable prices."
"Unfortunately, telecommunications markets in many Member States have still not achieved sufficient levels of openness to competition, and consumers and households are therefore discouraged by high prices and do not obtain sufficient digital skills."
"I therefore consider it essential to extend the integration and overall liberalisation of the single market and to eliminate obstacles to the provision of cross-border telecommunications services."
"At the same time, I support the creation of a better legal framework for the new digital space, which will ensure the protection of basic civil rights and intellectual property rights, as well as preventing computer crime, the dissemination of child pornography and other crimes on the Internet."
"It is envisaged that every household within the EU should have a broadband Internet connection at a competitive price by 2013."
"In addition, the intention is for Europe to be the most mobile continent in the world in terms of Internet access by 2015."
"I support the measures to that effect and have therefore voted in favour of this report."
"The new Digital Agenda for Europe is an ambitious programme to disseminate new technologies and fast links in the Member States, which is why I voted for it."
"However, apart from the pronouncements in principle which it makes, such as increasing mobile connection speeds and familiarising citizens with the new technologies, it would appear that some objectives will be extremely difficult to attain."
"For example, it would appear that, although highly desirable, the objective requiring all schools in the European Union to have high-speed Internet by 2015 will be difficult to achieve for objective reasons (for example in remote mountain and island countries, it is difficult to achieve high speeds immediately)."
"Consequently, the new Digital Agenda for Europe should be supported by a series of coordinated actions and initiatives, such as more generous EU funding to safeguard better access to the Internet, even for pupils at a geographical disadvantage."
"Europe continues to be a global leader in the field of advanced information and communication technologies (ICT)."
"The World Wide Web, the GSM standard for mobile telephones, the MPEG standard for digital content and ADSL technology are European inventions."
"Retaining this leadership and transforming it into a competitive advantage is a vital political objective."
"Over the last four years, ICT policies have confirmed these technologies' role as a driving force in the economic and social modernisation of Europe, and have strengthened Europe's resilience in times of crisis."
"All of the Union's Member States have developed ICT policies and consider these technologies to be an essential contribution to domestic growth and employment in the context of the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"Despite this, in the first decade of the 21st century, the EU is lagging behind in terms of ICT research and innovation."
"This is why the Union has launched ambitious research programmes intended to close the gap and to support far-sighted research and development activities."
"I would therefore repeat, clearly, my full support for these actions, in the firm belief that Europe can once again become a leader and prime mover in this extremely important sector."
"I voted in favour of this Parliament own-initiative report given the importance of the Digital Agenda in strengthening European technological leadership."
"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a key factor for growth at this time of economic recovery, but they are also essential to sustainable growth and the fight against social exclusion."
"The report supports the main points identified by the Ministerial Declaration on the Digital Agenda approved at the Informal Meeting of Telecommunications Ministers in Granada on 18 and 19 April."
"Parliament reiterates the need for the EU to have sound, swift and efficient infrastructures and encourages the adoption of measures that enable the achievement of full broadband coverage for all citizens."
"All citizens need to partake in the digital revolution for it to become a success."
"However, in order for this success to become a reality, aspects such as Internet security cannot be left to one side."
"The adopted report, therefore, is not only committed to providing all citizens with computer skills, but at the same time highlights the need to reinforce Internet security and respect for citizens' rights."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution given the fact that no damaging modifications were included."
"As recommended in the excellent report by my Polish fellow Member, Mr Liberadzki, I voted in favour of granting the European Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the EU general budget for the financial year 2008."
"I am pleased that certain ideas to which I am very attached have been taken up: the organisation of an interinstitutional conference involving all the parties concerned, in particular the national parliaments and the national auditing bodies, with a view to reforming the discharge procedure; the shortening of deadlines so that discharge is voted on in the year following the year under review; and the call by the European Court of Auditors for a single opinion (the application of the 'single audit' rule) on the reliability and the regularity of the underlying transactions as provided for in the Treaty."
"Moreover, we must simplify the rules on the allocation of European funds since many of the errors stem from the complex nature of procedures, which national complexities often add to."
"Finally, concerning audits of research bodies in Europe, I am pleased that the European Parliament has reinforced the message that we sent out to the Commission not to question in a harsh and often unfounded manner funding in relation to international audit standards."
"Progress has been made with the implementation of the budget for the financial year 2008, but there still remains a high number of errors in the areas of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, rural development, scientific research, energy and transport."
"The funds disbursed incorrectly amount to 11%."
"This was caused by complicated rules and regulations that Member States must adhere to."
"Therefore, when implementing the budget for the coming year, special attention should be paid to the simplification of those rules and regulations, the improvement of the mechanism for recovering incorrectly paid funds and the introduction of more effective systems for supervision and control."
"Once these measures have been implemented, it is likely that the execution of the EU budget will improve, more effective control of budget funds will be assured, and projects implemented by Member States will have greater added value for the development of various areas of the economy and other areas."
"Article 317 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that responsibility for implementation of the EU budget lies with the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, and that the Court of Auditors sends Parliament and the Council a statement on the reliability of the accounts and the regularity and legality of the underlying transactions."
"In the interests of transparency, I consider it essential that the European Parliament be able to verify the accounts and analyse in detail the implementation of the Union budget."
"I agree with the rapporteur and the resolutions on discharge when they draw attention to the urgency of introducing a national declaration at an appropriate political level, covering all EU funds coming under shared management, in order that each Member State take responsibility for the management of EU funds received."
"This is particularly important if we realise that 80% of EU expenditure is administered by the Member States."
"Lastly, I would note the positive opinion of the Court of Auditors concerning the accounts, which reassures the European public that the Union budget is being appropriately and rigorously managed, despite certain problems that continue to exist and are analysed in detail by this report."
"The overview provided by the nearly 40 reports devoted to the implementation of the 2008 EU budget by the various EU bodies is painful."
"For the 15th year running, the European Court of Auditors has been unable to approve the implementation of the budget of the European Commission, so marred is it by errors and unwarranted spending."
"However, the European Parliament is granting it discharge in respect of its management."
"The Commission is hiding behind the responsibility of the Member States, which are supposed to manage 80% of expenditure, in particular agricultural and regional expenditure."
"However, the problems in these two areas are lessening, whereas they are rocketing in the case of subsidies managed directly by Brussels."
"The situation as regards pre-accession assistance for Turkey is particularly serious and worrying. This is without mentioning the decentralised bodies that are multiplying, and the botched public procurement procedures with them, the random management of personnel and recruitment, the budgetary commitments that precede the corresponding legal commitments, and the excessive supervisory boards which make management costs soar and which, in the end, are unable to properly plan their occasionally rather unclear action, and therefore their budget."
"This is so much the case that, in one of her reports, Mrs Mathieu calls for an overall assessment of their usefulness."
"That is why we voted against the majority of these texts on budget discharge."
"A vote for discharge does not mean that the situation is totally ideal."
"I think that the situation is evolving in the right direction, but at too slow a rate."
"The number of errors has fallen, but we have still not reached the 'tolerable error level'."
"I wish to stress the need to make it compulsory for all Member States to submit national management declarations, just as Parliament has repeatedly requested."
"I am opposed to the traffic-light system (red, amber, green) for Romania and Bulgaria alone, as this would be a discriminatory measure."
"There are shortcomings in many other Member States, and common monitoring rules need to be applied."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the Commission and executive agencies."
"The Liberadzki report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the 2008 financial year, Section III - Commission and executive agencies adopts a very negative tone for Greece on a series of issues from manipulation of financial statistics to vague accusations of generalised corruption in the country."
"Our parliamentary group asked to be able to vote separately against specific references which are insulting to Greece under the part vote procedure."
"However, this proved to be unfeasible, which is why I voted against the entire Liberadzki report."
"On 5 May I voted in favour of Mr Liberadzki's report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008, Section III - Commission and executive agencies."
"However, I voted for the removal of paragraph 376, which proposed that the pre-accession aid for Turkey be reduced to the level provided in 2006, and paragraph 378, in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission to amend the objectives of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, for example by means of special forms of membership."
"The reason for this is that I believe it to be wrong that a report on the Commission's discharge should call into question the accession process and accession perspective of candidate countries."
"I firmly believe that once membership negotiations have commenced, irrespective of the candidate country concerned, they should be continued in a positive spirit without further complicating the EU accession process or putting obstacles in its way."
"As recommended in the very good report by my excellent fellow Member and Spanish neighbour, Mrs Ayala Sender, I voted in favour of granting the European Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds (EDF) for the financial year 2008."
"I unreservedly support EDF budgetisation and, when the time comes, the Union will have to create its own instrument for taking action in the area of development."
"Concerning the investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is a risk-bearing instrument funded by the EDF to encourage private investment in the difficult economic and political context of the ACP countries, I have very mixed feelings about the idea that the EIB should present a report as part of the discharge procedure, but this will be a point for discussion, especially if, as Parliament hopes, the Union becomes a shareholder in the EIB."
"I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public, which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how public funds have been used."
"Although the Court of Auditors believes that the revenue and commitments are free from material error, it is, however, concerned about the high incidence of non-quantifiable errors in budget support commitments and the material level of error in the payments."
"I, like the rapporteur, deplore the fact that the Court of Auditors was not able to obtain all the information and documentation concerning 10 sampled payments to international organisations and that consequently it is not able to express an opinion on the regularity of expenditure amounting to EUR 190 million, or 6.7% of the annual expenditure."
"I therefore call on the European Development Fund to resolve all of these issues for the next financial year (2009)."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds."
"The Members Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher and Liam Aylward voted in favour of the report on the discharge of the European Parliament regarding the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008, and they both welcome the report's recommendations in relation to improving transparency and responsibility."
"This transparency and responsibility is necessary for the successful functioning of the European Parliament and to encourage good governance in the European Union."
"Mr Gallagher and Mr Aylward gave particular support to the amendments which sought further transparency and which recommended providing the reports of the Internal Audit Service to the public."
"They also supported recommendations in relation to providing information to European taxpayers about Parliament's use of public money."
"I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public, which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"This report carries out an exhaustive analysis of Parliament's budgetary situation, drawing attention to certain issues that must be urgently reviewed."
"I note that the rapporteur expresses his concern at the continuing cases of petty crime on Parliament's premises, requesting as a result that the Secretary-General pay special attention to this matter in order to reduce petty crime."
"Although this point may appear trivial, it is naturally extremely important for all of us who use the European Parliament's facilities every day."
"Lastly, I would note the positive opinion of the Court of Auditors concerning the accounts, which reassures the European public that the Union budget is being appropriately and rigorously managed."
"The European Parliament has voted on the discharge in respect of Parliament's own accounts for 2008."
"Never before has this been done so thoroughly and with such a critical eye."
"It is a clear victory for both transparency and control and is in keeping with the traditional Danish view of good practice."
"The discharge report contains a number of points of criticism which require a tightening up of the current procedures and practices."
"These include increased clarity and openness with regard to the use of additional funds and the accountability of the financial players in Parliament."
"We are, of course, in favour of this and have therefore voted in favour of discharge and of the resolution as a whole."
"The European Parliament has to grant discharge to itself each year and that is precisely why a critical review is needed."
"The report is, of course, the result of a lot of compromises, but in essence it takes a particularly critical stance while at the same time pointing in the right direction with regard to future discharge procedures."
"Moreover, a great deal of support has been shown for this critical report across many groups in Parliament."
"My scepticism, or indeed my opposition to some of the statements contained in the resolution of the Staes report, should not be masked by my vote in favour of the discharge of the European Parliament's 2008 budget."
"Stating that the renovation costs of the Strasbourg seat following the disaster that took place in August 2008 should not be borne by European taxpayers is not enough."
"In fact, the European Parliament is legally obliged to look after the buildings that it owns with due care and attention."
"Moreover, appropriate legal proceedings have been initiated in order to obtain a refund for the costs incurred following the disaster."
"Finally, I should like to see a rigorous and objective review of the situation concerning the pension funds of MEPs rather than let it drift towards a certain demagogy."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the European Union general budget, Section I - European Parliament."
"in writing. - We followed the rapporteur, Staes, in this vote, even though we lost one key amendment, number 22, on the transparency of the use of public funds, defended by the same rapporteur."
"I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public, which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC)."
"Nevertheless, the Court of Auditors points to some situations where there has been no improvement, such as the reimbursement of the travel expenses of members of the EESC, which must be based on no more than their true costs, or the fact that the EESC grants its staff a financial advantage not granted by the other institutions, and that that results in higher expenses."
"I note with satisfaction the fact that the EESC has adopted the practice of including a chapter in its annual activity report describing how the previous discharge decisions of Parliament and the Court of Auditors were followed up."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008, Section VI - European Economic and Social Committee."
"I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public, which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used."
"Parliament's evaluation of the accounts submitted and their respective discharge falls into this category."
"I note with satisfaction that the report of the Court of Auditors mentions that the audit did not give rise to any significant observations as regards the Committee of the Regions (CoR)."
"I agree with the rapporteur's positive assessment of the improvements found in the CoR's internal control environment, in particular the inventory of its main administrative, operational and financial procedures."
"Lastly, I note with satisfaction the quality of the CoR's annual activity report, especially the explicit inclusion of how the previous discharge decisions of Parliament and the Court of Auditors were followed up, highlighting the importance and relevance of these decisions."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008, Section VII - Committee of the Regions."
"The increase in external agencies has been playing an important role in concentrating the technical and administrative capabilities that support decision making in the Commission."
"The fact that they are scattered throughout EU territory also allows the institutions to really get closer to the public, increasing their visibility and legitimacy."
"Although the increased number of agencies is, in general, positive, the truth is that it creates challenges regarding the monitoring and evaluation of their performance."
"For this very reason, following the adoption of the Commission communication 'European agencies - the way forward', of 11 March 2008, Parliament, the Council and the Commission relaunched the project of defining a common framework for the agencies and, in 2009, set up an interinstitutional working group."
"I think that this group will play a fundamental role in eliminating the problems that the Court of Auditors has identified in several of the agencies, many of them in common, and in defining a common framework that will allow for better financial and budgetary management in the future."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on performance, financial management and control of EU agencies."
"In its report on the annual accounts of the European Police College for the financial year 2008, the Court of Auditors added a rider to its opinion on the reliability of the accounts, without expressly qualifying it, and qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"In addition, overall, the College's replies to the Court of Auditors' remarks are once again inadequate and the remedial measures it puts forward are too vague and non-specific to enable the discharge authority adequately to determine whether the College is capable of improving in future."
"Further to this, there remain innumerable structural problems and irregularities relating to the College that are detailed in the report."
"It is for this very reason that I agree with the rapporteur in her decision to postpone her decision on granting the Director of the European Police College discharge in respect of the implementation of the College's budget for the financial year 2008."
"All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function."
"It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used, whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them, and whether any resources are being wasted."
"Generally - with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen - we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them."
"That is why I voted for the report on the European Police College."
"Consolidation of the biregional strategic partnership between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, signed in 1999, must be a priority on the European Union's foreign policy agenda."
"Although significant progress has been made during the last 10 years in terms of developing EU-Latin American bilateral relations, further steps still need to be taken."
"The partnership's ultimate objective is to create in 2015 a Euro-Latin American global interregional cooperation zone in the areas of politics, economics, trade, and social and cultural affairs, thereby ensuring sustainable development in both regions."
"Today's vote means that the European Parliament supports the adoption in future of a Euro-Latin American Charter for Peace and Security which will include, based on the UN Charter and related international legislation, strategies and guidelines on political actions and common security."
"I also think that the fight against climate change, which hits the poorest population in the world hardest, must become a key component in the EU-Latin American strategy."
"Both sides must make significant efforts to reach a common negotiating position as part of the discussions leading up to the UN Conference on climate change, which will be held at the end of the year in Mexico."
"The own-initiative report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America incorporates the approach that the EU promotes within international relations."
"Indeed, this text reconciles economic, social, political and institutional dimensions in order to ensure that trade between the two geographical areas also benefits the most disadvantaged populations and contributes to the sustainable development of the subcontinent."
"Moreover, the report recommends the harmonisation of financial regulations to introduce greater responsibility on the issue at global level."
"I therefore clearly voted in favour of this report."
"The resolution adopted today during the European Parliament plenary is an important sign indicating that the EU is very well aware of its global role."
"Latin America is the favourite tourist destination of many Europeans, but it means much more than this to Europe."
"Latin America may fall short in the area of democracy, judging by European standards and principles."
"The European Parliament recently debated a resolution concerning blatant human rights violations in Cuba."
"The situation ended in the death of people who were exercising their right to free expression."
"These are tragic situations which must never happen again."
"However, the European Union's experience indicates that a relationship built over time, based on friendship and diplomacy, is much more productive in the long term."
"A constructive approach will allow the European Union to successfully become an exporter of democratic principles, as it wishes to be."
"Latin America is a huge continent, which cannot be ignored from an economic or social perspective."
"In fact, the European Investment Bank has already been operating in the South American continent for a long time, offering the opportunity for long-term investments, which is a noteworthy sign in itself."
"The resolution adopted today is part of a clear mandate given to the EU High Representative on how to approach relations with Latin America."
"I support the message conveyed in the resolution on improving the coordination of the positions of countries on both continents with regard to the methods for implementing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially as the MDG Summit is going to be held this September."
"We need to establish common ground, all the more so as we are behind in achieving the targets proposed for 2015, particularly for combating poverty."
"Especially at a time of global recession, investments need to be focused on poorer countries and on the more vulnerable population groups so that they can benefit from new jobs and the conditions required for social integration."
"I voted for the report on the EU strategy for relations with Latin America, which argues for the creation of a full biregional strategic partnership."
"I would stress the importance of the recommendation to reconcile the positions of the two regional blocs regarding the negotiations on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"I share the rapporteur's opinion regarding the need to create deeper and closer ties of biregional cooperation between the European Union and Latin America."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the EU has to pay particular attention to one of the Latin American countries whose huge population, economic potential and position as a regional leader already demand it."
"I am talking, obviously, about the largest Portuguese-speaking country in the world: Brazil."
"Commission communication COM (2007) 281, of 30 May, explicitly recognised that 'EU-Brazil dialogue has not been sufficiently exploited and carried out mainly through EU-Mercosur dialogue."
"Brazil will be the last ""BRICSâ to meet the EU in a Summit. The time has come to look at Brazil as a strategic partner as well as a major Latin American economic actor and regional leader.'"
"While the other European institutions are doing their duty, the European Parliament resists forming a relationship with this great country except through Mercosur, making it the only one out of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) in which the European Union does not maintain a separate parliamentary delegation."
"The correction of this anachronistic and regrettable situation is urgent."
"The biregional strategic partnership contributes to further coordination between the EU and Latin America within international forums and institutions."
"As well as setting a common agenda it should continue to coordinate positions on matters of global importance, taking account of the interests and concerns of both parties."
"That is why I voted for the communication from the Commission 'The European Union and Latin America: Global Players in Partnership', which seeks to identify operational proposals aimed at the full implementation of the biregional strategic partnership."
"This report does not give consideration to the real problems that are being experienced in Latin America and does not set out the essential points that should be included in the EU strategy for relations with Latin America."
"For example, it glosses over all the economic and social problems that will result from the signing of free trade agreements, and it accepts the normalisation of relations with Honduras as an incontestable fact, ignoring the coup d'Ã©tat and the still recent murders of members of the Resistance Front against the coup."
"It ignores the situation in Colombia: the crimes of the paramilitaries, and the persecution of trade-union members and politicians are not problems worthy of any mention."
"It does, on the other hand, criticise Bolivia and Venezuela, although it never makes explicit reference to these countries."
"However, it says nothing about the redeployment of the United States Fourth Fleet in the region, the plan for the United States to use seven Colombian military bases, or the intervention operations that are undertaken from military bases in the territories of EU and NATO countries."
"Regrettably, the majority of the proposals that we made on the aforementioned issues were rejected, so in the end we voted against the resolution."
"I voted in favour of the report with one reservation, which is also a hope: that we will find a solution to the deep-rooted 'tango bond' situation that casts such a shadow over our relationship with Argentina."
"The determination to promote relations with Latin American countries could pave the way to resolving the whole issue of European investors' rights, in an appropriate manner."
"This text, which is of an arrogant and imperial nature, is not acceptable."
"It endorses the resumption of free trade agreement negotiations with Central America, Colombia and Peru."
"These negotiations are harmful from an economic and social perspective as much as a democratic one."
"How can we negotiate with Porfirio Lobo Sosa's putschist government in Honduras and then claim to be guardians of the rule of law and human rights?"
"How can we negotiate bilaterally with the oppressive governments of Ãlvaro Uribe and Alan GarcÃ­a and flout the opinion of other sovereign states, members of the Andean Community, Bolivia and Ecuador?"
"I vote against this text, which is in breach of the principles of democracy and humanism."
"We feel that the fact that the EU is the main investor and the second largest trading partner in Latin America, as well as the main donor of development aid, is reason enough for there to be a clear and well-defined strategy for relations between the EU and Latin America."
"We advocate the definition of clear guidelines on the best way of collaborating to promote political stability, fight climate change, manage migratory flows and prevent natural disasters."
"As was demonstrated in the Haiti tragedy, the EU is clearly now second rate compared to others that intervened."
"We therefore argue that the EU must improve its actions at international level."
"That being the case, it must intervene in a more consistent and effective way in international politics."
"This improvement must take place at the next summit, which is being held on 18 May in Madrid and in which the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission must participate actively."
"I was not able to vote in favour of this text because one of the objectives of the strategic partnership is to conclude subregional partnership agreements with Central America, Peru and Colombia, and Mercosur, despite the coup d'Ã©tat in Honduras and the illegitimate Government that Porfirio Lobo has formed as a result."
"The EU cannot treat governments that have been part of a coup d'Ã©tat in the same way as elected governments."
"Likewise, the objective of creating a Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area does not take into account the asymmetries between the regions."
"The current terms of the Association Agreement between the EU and Peru and Colombia are similar to those of a free trade agreement, and it will not benefit the European or Latin American people."
"I also do not agree with the possibility of opening up a triangular political dialogue (such as EU-Latin America-United States)."
"There are already multilateral organisations such as the United Nations for this sort of dialogue."
"It also includes the creation of the Europe-Latin America and Caribbean Foundation."
"I would not be opposed to this concept if the rapporteur were not proposing that it be established using public and private capital, which is a clear way in for multinationals."
"The comprehensive report on Latin America takes a sensible approach in providing for the development of relations between the EU and the South American States by means of a strategic partnership."
"This creation of a Euro-Latin American area has the potential not only to bring positive economic results but also, above all, to strengthen the role of the EU as a foreign-policy player, particularly in respect of the United States."
"Unfortunately, the report also contains some paragraphs and certain wordings which hint at the almost missionary zeal of some Members of this House and which could be construed as too much interference in the internal affairs of the South American States."
"It is neither necessary nor meaningful to prescribe in detail how these countries should organise their economy or their education and science policies, or the details of how they regulate their foreign policy."
"It is absurd to call on the Latin American countries to introduce sex education, for example."
"I therefore abstained during the final vote."
"The European Union is Latin America's partner."
"Together we must combat today's challenges and global problems."
"Problems like the economic and financial crisis, climate change, threats to security, the fight against terrorism, the drug trade and organised crime."
"Together we must conserve the environment, save natural resources and also fight poverty, inequality and migration."
"I voted for this report since it proposes appropriate measures for combating poverty in the region: education and a reduction in the disparities between the richest and poorest countries in the region."
"The EU has the Solidarity Funds and also promotes integration projects, whereas Latin America does not have such opportunities."
"I agree with the rapporteur that, if Latin America follows the EU model of integration, this region will become stronger."
"Moreover, it will bring its inhabitants increased security and prosperity."
"in writing. - I abstained on the final vote on this report."
"Though the report is by no means anything we could accept as a good contribution to the forthcoming EU-Latin America Summit in Madrid, we managed to keep or vote into the text some important aspects."
"The green highlights in the middle of a disappointing report are: the paragraph concerning the ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on feminicides (the case of Campo Algodonero in Mexico) was kept in the text, with 359 votes in favour, 235 against and 17 abstentions; we succeeded in getting into the text that the European investment facility should in particular be used for projects contributing to combating climate change, such as local public transport, electric vehicles and the Yasuni-ITT project in Ecuador ('Keep the oil underground')."
"All in all, 10 out of the 16 green/EFA amendments were adopted."
"Unfortunately, we lost all amendments which referred sceptically to the recently concluded free trade agreements and the association agreements under negotiation, and which warn against the risks of weakening the existing fragile regional integration efforts."
"Finally, our amendment asking for the phasing-out of mega-energy projects that heavily damage the environment was rejected, too."
"in writing. - (ES) In view of the fact that some of the expressions included in paragraph 34, introduced by the opinion of the Committee on Development, are so ambiguous that they could be interpreted as being somewhat complacent regarding something as repulsive as abortion, the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has asked the group for a separate vote on that paragraph, in order to make it crystal clear that it is opposed to any initiative aimed at infringing the inalienable rights of the most vulnerable."
"The European Union and Latin America have been developing a strong strategic partnership for years."
"The Union is the main investor in Latin America, its second largest trading partner and its main donor of development aid."
"The ultimate goal is to create a Euro-Latin American global interregional partnership area by 2015, in the areas of politics, economics, trade and social and cultural affairs, intended to ensure sustainable development in both regions."
"In this context, I would stress the importance, first of all, of resuming negotiations on the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement, which will surely be the most ambitious biregional agreement ever."
"I also welcome the trade partnership agreements between the European Union and Central America and with the Andean Community, as well as the deepening of the existing Association Agreements with Mexico and Chile."
"Nevertheless, it is regrettable that such agreements could affect internal EU production in those very sectors, especially in the outermost regions, which face permanent difficulties."
"It is also regrettable that adequate compensation for these regions has not been found at Union level."
"I voted for this report because I consider a partnership between these two regions of the globe essential, as it will bring mutual advantages in the political, economic and social spheres."
"The resolution voted on today expresses the European Parliament's concern about the Canadian authorities retaining the visa requirement for Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens, and it calls for this requirement to be waived as soon as possible."
"Retaining the visa requirement for citizens from these Member States violates the principle of freedom of movement, creating unjustified discrepancies and inequalities."
"European Union citizens must enjoy equal and fair treatment."
"Although the EU-Canada Summit held in Prague in 2009 reaffirmed the partners' common objective of ensuring the freedom of movement of persons in complete security between the EU and Canada, it is now 2010 and nothing has changed."
"I firmly believe that, in the near future, the Canadian authorities will make every effort to waive these visas."
"Along with my fellow Members of the European Parliament, I will continue the actions already initiated to allow Romanian, Bulgarian and Czech citizens to travel freely as soon as possible."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution, as I believe that the ongoing negotiations towards a comprehensive economic trade agreement could strengthen EU-Canada relations."
"It is expected that the forthcoming EU-Canada Summit would focus on reinforcement of the political relationship between the two partners, in particular addressing such shared challenges as negotiations on a comprehensive economic trade agreement, foreign and security challenges, a coordinated response to the financial and economic crisis as also climate change and energy. As the EU and Canada are committed to build a low-carbon global economy that is safe and sustainable, also to invest in clean energy technologies and become the leaders in green job creation in order the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change would be strengthened."
"Citizens of three EU Member States still require visas to enter Canada."
"The Romanians and Bulgarians have been joined by the Czechs, who have had the compulsory visa requirement reimposed on them due to the large influx of Roma."
"In this situation closer cooperation is needed, on the one hand, between EU Member States in order to resolve the Roma community's problems and, on the other hand, between Member States and Canada in order to create the most effective and transparent system possible for providing information about the conditions for granting visas, so as to reduce the refusal rate."
"At the same time, Canada's asylum system needs to be reviewed."
"In fact, in this respect, the resolution's merit lies in that it makes a direct request to the Canadian side to take action in waiving the compulsory visa requirement."
"Canada is one of the European Union's oldest partners, and this year's summit is important in order to continue and consolidate this close bilateral cooperation in every area."
"I voted for the joint resolution because it reflects in a concise and objective manner the positive prospect of our future cooperation."
"Guaranteeing reciprocity in bilateral relations is one of the European Union's basic principles."
"I hope that, in the near future, Canada will waive the visa requirements for Romanian, Czech and Bulgarian citizens, thereby ensuring fair and equal treatment for all European Union citizens."
"At the same time, I wish to welcome the measures which have been taken so far aimed at signing an EU-Canada trade agreement and I hope that this year's meeting will give the necessary impetus to finalise it."
"Bearing in mind the current economic situation and state of the climate, I must emphasise the need for close cooperation in order to identify alternatives to the traditional resources for producing energy, which will respect the particular features of each state, as both the EU and Canada are involved in developing and using low-carbon technologies."
"At the same time, cooperation must also be promoted in the energy, climate and maritime sectors in the Arctic region."
"Canada constitutes a reliable and important partner for the European Union for historical and cultural reasons, because of ethnic and political affinities, and because our civilisations share values and points of reference."
"A comprehensive economic trade agreement with Canada could make a positive contribution to deepening the already excellent relations between the EU and Canada."
"Although difficulties have arisen in this relationship, specifically as regards fisheries, security and immigration, the truth is that, in comparison with other countries, the EU-Canada relationship is stable and profitable for both partners."
"I hope that this trust relationship lasts a long time and that both sides of the North Atlantic continue to be peaceful and prosperous."
"I note that the partnership between Canada and the European Union is one of our oldest and closest, dating back to 1959, and that the current negotiations towards a comprehensive economic trade agreement aim to further strengthen EU-Canada relations."
"I would stress that in 2010 Canada holds the chairmanship of the G8 group of countries and will be hosting the next G20 Summit."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Commission statement in which progress in the negotiations on a comprehensive economic trade agreement is cited as fundamental to EU-Canada economic relations."
"In this regard, I believe that the EU-Canada Summit in Brussels on 5 May 2010 offers a good opportunity to speed up those negotiations."
"In particular, I welcome the intention to launch a major reform of Canada's fisheries management system, also involving the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation."
"This text is very much in favour of the negotiations initiated by the Commission with a view to securing a global economic and trade agreement between the EU and Canada."
"This agreement will be negotiated behind the backs of European citizens despite the fact it will have a significant impact on their daily lives in the following areas: the dismantling of public services; the superiority of the right of investors to protect their profits over that of states to protect the general interest; the downgrading of workers' rights; and the restriction of access to health services, water, education and culture."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament propose backing and even speeding up this policy and this glaring denial of democracy."
"I completely oppose it."
"Canada has a history of partnership with the EU."
"It is therefore natural that over the years this relationship has deepened and improved."
"The comprehensive economic trade agreement is going to be approached in a very special way at this summit, in the hope that these negotiations are successful, because the agreement is fundamental to EU-Canada economic relations."
"There are still other relevant issues between the EU and Canada, such as Union aid, in particular to Haiti, questions relating to fisheries, and environmental concerns."
"We cannot forget that the Treaty of Lisbon has given this House new powers with regard to negotiating international agreements: Parliament must now be involved at all stages of negotiations."
"I have voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Canada Summit, held today, as I think that it is important not only to maintain relations at a high level, but also to deepen and improve them further."
"In particular, the planned joint action for the introduction of a bank levy or financial transaction tax at a global level should also be emphasised in this context."
"in writing. - The resolution was carried with a large majority."
"I abstained because of the wording in paragraph 6 on Roma people justifying Canada's restrictive visa policy against Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic."
"However, the Verts/ALE Group was successful in getting the following in the resolution regarding bluefin tuna and CITES: 'expresses its disappointment about the position of the Canadian Government at the most recent conference of CITES parties with regard to the extension of CITES Appendix 1 for bluefin tuna'."
"When the European Parliament voted on the resolution setting priorities for the forthcoming summit between the EU and Canada, I was among the minority that voted against the proposal."
"The text is largely sound, but it contains two paragraphs that I simply cannot support."
"Paragraph 2 states that one of the priority topics to be discussed at the summit should be 'the issue of introducing a bank levy or a transaction tax at global level'."
"I strongly oppose this type of levy or tax on international transactions."
"In my opinion, there are numerous other issues within the economic sphere that it would be better to give priority to during the summit."
"Furthermore, I am concerned about the wording in paragraph 6, which states that Parliament 'notes that the visa requirement for Czech citizens has been introduced by the Canadian Government in response to an influx of Roma people into Canada'."
"This may be the reason why Canada has done this, but, as I see it, there is no reason whatsoever for us as Europeans to support it or even mention it in an EU text."
"As these two passages were included in the resolution and the request to delete them was, unfortunately, not supported by the majority, I voted against the resolution as a whole."
"The European Parliament has demonstrated through today's vote that it is receptive to signing a new agreement on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data as part of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme."
"It has also reiterated that any new agreement in this area must comply with the new legal framework introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The fight against terrorism is still a priority for the EU, and productive cooperation with the US, which includes activities such as exchanging data and information, is an important condition for averting terrorist attacks in future."
"I believe that it is vital for this exchange of data to be strictly limited to information requested for combating terrorism, with any transfer of bulk data marking a departure from the principles underlying European legislation and practices."
"This is why I have used today's resolution to request the Commission and Council explicitly to raise this issue in an appropriate manner as part of the negotiations with the US due to take place in the near future, and to examine, along with our US partners, the means of establishing a procedure that is legally transparent and viable, with the aim of authorising the transfer and extraction of the relevant data."
"I voted in favour of the joint resolution on SWIFT, which concerns the transfer of Europeans' banking data to the United States as part of the fight against terrorism."
"Following the warnings issued by the European Parliament a few weeks ago, the negotiation process is now on the right track."
"The European Parliament will now play a part in this, in accordance with the procedures laid down by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The objective is to achieve a good balance between effectively protecting our fellow citizens from terrorist risks and respecting individual rights."
"In my view, the negotiation mandate presented to the Council today by Parliament supports this view."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution, since it is important to have an agreement which would help both Europe and the United States strengthen the fight against terrorism in the interests of the security of the citizens, without undermining the rule of law."
"Fundamental principles still need to be laid down by the EU stating how it will generally cooperate with the US for counter-terrorism purposes."
"Therefore it goes under the responsibility of the Commission and the Council to explore ways of establishing a transparent and legally sound procedure for the authorisation of the transfer and extraction of relevant data as well as for the conduct and supervision of data exchanges."
"Such steps are to be taken in full compliance with the principles of necessity and proportionality and with full respect for fundamental rights requirements under EU law, which would make it possible for relevant European legislation to become fully applicable."
"We must strive to enhance transatlantic cooperation in the areas of justice, freedom and security within a context of respect for human rights and civil liberties."
"A system for protecting personal data must be implemented transparently and unequivocally."
"European legal requirements for the fair, proportionate and lawful processing of personal information are of paramount importance and must always be upheld."
"Currently targeted data exchange is impossible."
"Solutions should include restricting the scope of the transferred data and listing the types of data that the designated providers are able to filter and extract, as well as the types of data which may be included in a transfer."
"Therefore, it is particularly important to urge the Council and the Commission to explore ways of establishing a transparent and legally sound procedure for authorising the transfer and extraction of relevant data as well as for executing and monitoring data exchange operations."
"Any agreement between the EU and the US must include strict implementation and supervision safeguards on the day-to-day extraction of, access to and use by the US authorities of all data transferred to them under the agreement."
"There should be an appropriate EU-appointed authority to monitor the implementation of these measures."
"As a national state, Romania has supported the adoption of the SWIFT agreement."
"However, the European Parliament considered that the first version of the agreement negotiated by the representatives of the Commission and the US Administration breached the rights of European citizens whose data was processed in bulk rather than only on a specific basis when suspicions were aroused."
"It is important for the new agreement, negotiated recently in Washington between representatives of the EU and the US Congress, to address the European Parliament's concerns."
"There is always the risk that the new version of the agreement will be rejected too, if it continues to contravene the European Charter of Human Rights."
"The European Parliament is aware that this agreement is important even for Europeans' security."
"As a result, it is becoming clear that MEPs' objections relate to the content rather than form of the agreement."
"The European Parliament has acquired greater decision-making powers through the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is the norm for this institution to exercise its own prerogatives and to monitor the interests of the European Union's citizens."
"However, as long as the spirit of the views expressed by the European legislative are going to be preserved in the future version of the agreement, it will be adopted."
"The fight against terrorism and the rapid detection of suspicious bank transfers remain as much as ever at the top of the EU's list of priorities."
"Following the rejection of the SWIFT agreement by the European Parliament in February 2010, a new agreement must be negotiated between the European Union and the United States for the transfer of bank data in the context of the fight against terrorism."
"By rejecting the agreement in February, we MEPs refused to allow the continuation of the massive, uncontrolled transfer of data to the United States Treasury Department."
"I voted for this resolution today in order to influence the new mandate that the European Commission will have to negotiate a new agreement with the United States."
"Basically, we are asking for the 'bulk' transfer of personal data to be reconsidered so that it is carried out in a more targeted way, so that legal redress is provided for, so that data is kept for the shortest time possible and so that data exchanges are performed on a reciprocal basis."
"The issue of the protection of personal data is an important one for the European Parliament."
"Therefore, we have been very vigilant as regards the issue of transferring air passenger data."
"We will protect the fundamental rights of our fellow citizens all the way."
"in writing. - I supported the resolution on the new Commission recommendation to the Council to authorise the opening of negotiations with the United States on the transfer of financial messaging data to combat terrorism."
"Under the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, the interim agreement between the European Union and the USA, signed in November 2009, required the consent of the European Parliament."
"I voted against that agreement, which was blocked by Parliament out of concern for the privacy rights of European citizens and companies, put at risk by unregulated bulk data-sharing arrangements."
"Terrorism has to be fought decisively, but the means employed cannot be allowed to create an environment of insecurity for citizens' rights which is the very objective of terror attacks in the first place."
"Any new agreement needs to be subordinated to fundamental principles such as a strict limitation of exchanges to necessary counter-terrorism purposes and a European authority has to ensure judicial oversight and respect for fundamental rights requirements under EU law."
"The agreement needs to be limited in duration and liable for immediate termination should any obligation not be met."
"I voted against this particular motion for a resolution, because it does not reject the mass exchange of data with the US and other countries within the context of the so-called fight against terrorism."
"Nor does it promote the need for an internationally binding agreement between the EU and the US on a framework for the exchange of information for the purpose of imposing the law."
"Finally because, as the European Parliament will need to approve the agreement drafted, it is unacceptable for even unofficial negotiations to have started without its full and equitable participation."
"I voted against the interim agreement signed between the EU and the United States on the processing and transfer of financial data on European citizens, not only because it is manifestly bad owing to the fact that it calls into question respect for the principles of necessity and proportionality, as well as the integrity and security of European financial data, but also because Parliament was denied the chance to properly exercise its prerogatives."
"I believe in the need to enhance transatlantic cooperation in all relevant areas, specifically in the area of freedom, security and justice, but this can only happen if there is absolute respect for fundamental principles, such as proportionality, necessity and reciprocity."
"I must, at this juncture, compliment both the Commission and the Council on their new position regarding cooperation with Parliament."
"I hope that together we succeed in establishing the basic principles that must orientate and facilitate future cooperation between the EU and the United States on fighting terrorism."
"I look forward to the conclusions of the visit of Parliament's delegation to Washington, and hope that here too we will be able to see the start of a new chapter."
"I voted in favour of this resolution and I must reiterate that EU-US cooperation in the fight against terrorism, in the same way as the signing of a specific agreement between the EU and US in this area, is of crucial importance."
"This agreement must be permanently on Parliament's radar."
"The Council and Commission must keep Europe's legislative body informed during every stage of the negotiation and signing of this agreement."
"The European Parliament has expressed its stance on this matter on a number of occasions."
"Another key aspect of the resolution stipulates that any data transfer request must be approved by a European judiciary authority."
"The data transfer must be justified and take place in a transparent manner."
"Citizens must have their rights guaranteed, such as being allowed to have access to, amend and delete data, as well as receiving compensation and damages in the event of any violation of their privacy."
"I wish to stress the need to find a solution for restricting data transfers, which will only allow data to be exchanged for persons suspected of terrorism."
"It is important that the principles of reciprocity and proportionality in the agreement are respected and that it is cancelled immediately in the case of non-fulfilment of the obligations which have been assumed."
"I firmly believe that the JHA Council will take into consideration the recommendations featuring in this resolution."
"I voted for this resolution because I believe that any agreement between the EU and the United States in this area must also include strict safeguards on implementation and supervision, to be monitored by an appropriate EU-appointed authority."
"Only in this way can it be ensured that these data transfers do not constitute a departure from the principles underpinning EU legislation and practice."
"International legal cooperation and transatlantic cooperation are fundamental to the fight against terrorism."
"That is why the existence of a long-term agreement between the European Union and the United States dealing with the prevention of terrorism financing should be welcomed."
"Nonetheless, such an agreement cannot put the privacy of the transactions of natural and legal persons at risk."
"For that reason, European legal requirements for the fair, necessary, proportionate and lawful processing of personal information are of paramount importance and must therefore continue to apply in all circumstances."
"The EU must lay down the fundamental principles governing the forms of general cooperation with the US for counterterrorism purposes and the mechanisms for passing on information on transactions by its citizens that are considered suspicious or irregular."
"An EU/US legal-cooperation agreement dealing with the prevention of terrorism financing must be signed, ensuring that personal data transfers respect the rights and freedoms of European citizens and companies, and that their security is protected, without putting the privacy of their transactions at unnecessary risk."
"Under the terms of the Interim Agreement signed between the US and the EU, I recognised the need for transatlantic cooperation in the fight against international crime and terrorism."
"I stressed that this cooperation should be established on the basis of mutual trustworthiness and respect for the principles of reciprocity, proportionality and respect for citizens' rights."
"Security, however, should not override but rather be compatible with other rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"It is not acceptable that the police in Portugal can only access the bank details of a person on the basis of a warrant but that millions of pieces of data can be sent to be interpreted and analysed by the US police without any judicial control."
"I therefore voted against the Interim Agreement."
"Nonetheless, the new motion for a resolution in question demonstrates a new position from the Commission and Council in terms of collaboration with Parliament."
"I hope that future EU-US cooperation in the fight against terrorism is based on the principles of proportionality, necessity and reciprocity."
"Following the significant defeat of the EU's draft SWIFT agreement with the United States, a resolution has come back to us that is worthy of our strongest criticism because it accepts the idea of a major exchange of data in the area of the so-called 'fight against terrorism'."
"Many specialists have stated that the protection of rights, freedoms and guarantees are not ensured under such an agreement."
"The so-called 'SWIFT agreement' and the framework agreement on the protection and sharing of data constitute a threat, not a guarantee of security."
"There is a different understanding of data protection, competencies, legislation and privacy where EU-US relations are concerned."
"These issues need to be clarified before the Commission is given a new mandate."
"Nevertheless, the majority of this House has given the Commission a truly blank cheque by setting ambiguous limitations such as 'proportionality' or 'reciprocity'."
"This opens a veritable Pandora's box against liberty and promotes the removal of functions from the Member States, such as the decision over transferral of data about their citizens, which is being given to a European 'judicial public authority'."
"There is no possibility of 'proportionality' and 'reciprocity' in the case of bulk data storage and transfer, since it involves a series of uncontrollable dangers, specifically relating to who has access, how the data are used and for what purpose."
"I voted in favour of the European Commission having a strengthened mandate to negotiate with the US authorities on the SWIFT issue."
"Indeed, we must receive assurances that two important reservations - the question of bulk data transfer and the opportunity for Europeans to have legal redress in the United States - are lifted."
"That is why I believe that this mandate should be substantially changed before it is adopted, otherwise at the end of the negotiations I would again be compelled to vote against this agreement, as I have already done in the past."
"I am voting against this text, which favours the possibility of an agreement between Europe and the United States on the transfer of SWIFT data."
"It is impracticable, under the current conditions, to filter the data that will be sent to the US authorities."
"The US authorities will thus have access to a great deal of private data sent as an urgent measure as a result of a terrorist threat that, while genuine, is still being exploited for imperial purposes."
"Moreover, this text does not require reciprocity on the part of the United States, but merely dares to 'point out' submissively that it would be normal."
"To turn Europe into a vassal of the United States is completely unacceptable."
"There has never been a better time for Europe to assert its independence from the United States."
"The fight against terrorism is a concern for the EU, as well as the rest of the democratic world."
"Any mechanism that may help discover possible attacks is essential to success in this fight."
"The SWIFT agreement is a very powerful instrument in the fight against terrorism, as it gives access to privileged financial information regarding sums transferred between countries."
"The renegotiation of this agreement with the United States is a unique opportunity for the EU to make an effective contribution to discovering new terrorists and potential attacks."
"At the moment there is great desire to cooperate on the US side: it is promoting an agreement that effectively protects the transmitted data and has the maximum amount of reciprocity possible."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted against this joint resolution on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Conservatives and Reformists Group because the text supports the possibility of reaching an agreement between the 27 Member States and the United States for the transfer of bank data under the pretext of combating terrorism."
"Under the current conditions, the United States authorities would have access to a large quantity of private data on millions of Europeans."
"I think that the United States' request is unacceptable and is a threat to the freedoms and rights of European citizens."
"With this proposal the most conservative forces are trying to hand us over bound hand and foot for US interests without giving a thought to the security or privacy of citizens."
"The European Parliament cannot allow the civil rights and freedoms of Europeans to be violated for counter-terrorism purposes."
"The motion for a resolution on the negotiations for a new SWIFT agreement contains numerous detailed proposals for how data protection can be improved in future in connection with making financial messaging data available to the United States."
"That is very much to be welcomed."
"However, in so doing, it conceals the question of the fundamental necessity of such a massive invasion of privacy."
"This is clearly simply assumed."
"However, it is unclear whether we can counter the phenomenon of terrorism effectively in this way."
"It is also unclear how the calls for more data protection are to be implemented in practice."
"We know from past experience and common practice that data are used as extensively as possible and often also for profit."
"I therefore reject the transfer of highly personal data on principle and thus also voted against the motion for a resolution."
"I voted today in favour of Parliament's resolution, which was also supported by most of the political groups and which contains Parliament's conditions for the ratification of the new SWIFT agreement and the start of a new round of negotiations with the US."
"Parliament's objective is to lay down flexible rules for promoting transatlantic cooperation which will help to combat terrorism and create a transmission system in which Union citizens can trust."
"One of the most sensitive points of negotiation, to which particular attention must be paid, is a reduction in the volume of data transmitted."
"In order to achieve this, the new agreement will need to include a series of guarantees designed to ensure compliance with European legislation which protects the personal data of European citizens."
"In addition, as stated in the resolution, it is important for EU citizens to be given a better appeal mechanism, so that they can defend their rights more effectively."
"in writing. - I abstained on the vote on the Swift resolution (TFTP)."
"It was adopted, however, by a very large majority (no roll-call vote)."
"Our group abstained because our key amendments were rejected, namely Amendment 8 asking for data transfer to be subject to judicial authorisation, and Amendment 9 asking for the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAA) to be used for Tracking Finance Terrorist Programme (TFTP) purposes."
"Other important Verts/ALE amendments were also rejected: EU definition of terrorism instead of the US one, ban on further transfer to third countries or bodies and limits to data retention period."
"The resolution can be seen nevertheless as a quite strong message in view of the EU-US negotiations for a new TFTP agreement after the rejection (assent procedure) last February of the former one even though in our view the text adopted today is a step backwards in comparison with the Parliament resolution adopted last September."
"The fight against terrorism and its financing is an inescapable reality and deserves our full attention, so transatlantic cooperation is imperative."
"The previous attempt at an agreement between the European Union and the United States on the processing and transfer of data lacked proportionality, reciprocity and transparency."
"This motion for a resolution calls for the adoption of a common definition of 'terrorist activity' and a clarification of the concept of 'non-extracted data'."
"It also reiterates the need to use the principle of necessity to limit the exchange of information, with such exchanges being strictly limited to the period of time necessary for their purpose."
"A series of guarantees is now being proposed that is based on European legislative practice and, therefore, offers greater protection for the fundamental rights of citizens."
"Attempts are being made not only to safeguard the principle of non-discrimination throughout the data-processing procedure, but also to set up a European authority that is capable of receiving and overseeing the United States' requests."
"I voted for this motion for a resolution because I understand that the foundations have now been laid to allow the start of negotiations that favour the reaching of a balanced agreement between the European Union and the United States."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution."
"Whereas in our digital age, data protection, the right of informational self-determination, personal rights and the right to privacy have become values that play an ever increasing role and must therefore be protected with special care."
"In order to protect these rights in an appropriate way it should be ensured that all transfers of personal data from the EU and its Member States to third countries for security purposes are based on international agreements with the status of legislative acts."
"Even more the use of PNR data should be based on a single set of principles that would serve as a basis for agreements with third countries and must be in line with European data protection standards."
"I agree with the proposals set out in this European Parliament resolution that, before adopting a new legal measure, we must assess the impact on privacy based on proportionality, since it is essential to evaluate whether existing legal measures are insufficient."
"Technology and mobility are essential features of today's world, and so personal rights and the right to privacy have become values that we must ensure and guard closely."
"I agree with Parliament's calls for an examination of Advance Passenger Information and Passenger Name Record measures; while combating crime we must at the same time ensure that current measures are proportionate and do not violate people's fundamental rights."
"Thus, the transfer of passenger data must comply with EU data protection standards, and data must only be used in connection with specific crimes or threats."
"Given that Passenger Name Record data is used for security purposes, the conditions for the transfer of data must be laid down in international agreements with the EU, ensuring legal certainty for EU citizens and airlines."
"In new EU agreements, we must also lay down appropriate supervision and control measures that would help us coordinate the transfer and use of Passenger Name Record data."
"The need to reach a balanced agreement with the United States on the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data has been a constant concern in recent years."
"The current state of the negotiations still does not reflect the existence of true legal protection for data in the United States, as these data can be kept for years after the security checks have been carried out and there is no legal protection for anyone who is not a US citizen."
"The agreements reached with Australia and Canada are more acceptable because more respect is given to the principle of proportionality, as access to the data is limited in terms of type, time and amount by judicial controls."
"It is only through a consistent approach and the establishment of general principles and rules regarding the use of PNR data that we can bring an end to this impasse and move on to conclude any international agreements in this field, whether with these three countries or with the avalanche of similar requests that will soon come."
"I support the joint proposal to postpone the vote on Parliament's consent, in the hope that with a little more time the negotiations might meet the concerns that Parliament has always expressed."
"The debate on the transfer of the personal data of passengers on transatlantic flights by airlines has been a significant sore point in the European Union's relations with the United States, Australia and Canada, and it captures the essence of one of the dilemmas of our times."
"On the one hand, nobody doubts the particular need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of every citizen's data."
"On the other hand, few people would deny that we live in a time in which threats to people's security require, not just better information exchange between police authorities in crime fighting, but also better processing of this information in order to make it more suitable for fighting organised crime and, particularly, terrorism."
"I hope that the postponement in the process imposed by the European Parliament will enable a fair balance between these values to be reached."
"The current state of the negotiations on data transfers still does not ensure effective legal protection of the data in the United States, as they can be retained for years after the security checks have been carried out and there is no legal protection for anyone who is not a US citizen."
"I therefore support the joint proposal to postpone the vote on Parliament's consent, in the hope that more time may allow the negotiations to meet the concerns that this House has expressed on this matter."
"I supported this resolution in order to demonstrate my concerns over the use of PNR data (data that is basically purely commercial) as part of the negotiation of agreements with the United States and Australia (for the purposes of fighting crime)."
"Indeed, I believe that, before signing any agreement on the transfer of data to third parties, it would be wiser to first work on the development of a general framework on this type of agreement, defining minimum conditions, such as legal limitation, a solid legal basis, data protection standards and a restricted retention period."
"We must also defend the right of European citizens to have incorrect data deleted and obtain reciprocity for European access to our partners' data."
"That is why I hope that the discussions continue."
"I shall vote in favour of this text."
"It proposes the rejection of the current agreements with the United States and Australia on the transmission of what is known as the PNR data of European air passengers."
"Transmitting such data undermines the freedom of movement of European citizens."
"The group to which I belong has some experience of this: one of the members of staff, a human rights activist, has been forbidden outright from visiting or flying over United States territory after having been included on a blacklist for potential terrorists."
"This is the kind of arbitrary restriction of freedoms to which agreements of this type expose us."
"Terrorist acts do occur."
"They must be combated."
"However, they must never be used as a pretext for repressing fundamental freedoms."
"Passenger Name Records (PNR) are another weapon in the fight against terrorism."
"Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is once again called upon to take part in the negotiations on a new PNR agreement between the EU, the US, Australia and Canada."
"As a great advocate of the fight against terrorism, the EU is prepared to negotiate any agreement that may be effective in this fight."
"The Union will not, however, endanger civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"For the reasons already mentioned in connection with the SWIFT agreement, I oppose the transfer of data, in particular if the constructive use of these data cannot really be demonstrated or if the misuse of the data cannot be ruled out."
"The motion for a resolution refers to the possible dangers in detail and recommends postponement of the vote on the request for consent on the agreements with the US and Australia on passenger name record data."
"For this reason, I voted in favour of the motion."
"The creation of a single model for passenger records which will be applied in PNR agreements with all interested countries and the postponement of the vote on the request for approval of agreements with the US and Australia would appear to be the best solution."
"A rushed approach which might result in a negative note on PNR agreements with the US and Australia would stop the flow of data and that might result in landing rights being cancelled, with disastrous consequences for the airlines."
"The motion for a joint resolution tabled today by all the groups in Parliament, which I too voted in favour of, rightly states that PNR agreements must take account of minimum specifications which are non-negotiable."
"The primary objective is passenger security, but that cannot be achieved at the expense of respect for privacy and protection for personal data."
"Restricting data collection, which must always be in keeping with the principle of proportionality and necessity, is of crucial importance to passenger data transmission."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution."
"The PNR resolution was adopted by a very large majority and with our support."
"It calls for a postponement of the vote on the assent on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreements with the US, Canada and Australia until the strongest guarantees have been obtained on data protection, period of retention, limitations to the purpose, parliamentary scrutiny, judicial control, right of access and redress."
"in writing. - I did support this resolution as raised many concerns both in the European Parliament and outside it."
"Cyanide has been recognised as a highly toxic chemical used in the gold-mining industry and which qualifies as a main pollutant and can have catastrophic and irreversible impact on human health and environment."
"This chemical has caused the largest ecological disaster in the history of Central Europe."
"It is unfortunate that no clear rules are being established at the EU level and cyanide continues to be used in gold miming putting the workers and environment at a great risk."
"I believe that only a complete ban on cyanide mining technologies can protect our water resources and ecosystems against cyanide pollution."
"I support the amendment aimed at removing paragraph 4 contained in the draft resolution voted on today."
"I therefore voted for this amendment."
"However, I voted against the draft resolution for a number of reasons."
"We cannot ask the European Commission to ban the use of cyanide technology in gold mining for some Member States, such as Romania, which has major untapped resources."
"The RoÅia MontanÄ project deserves to receive support in view of its economic and social impact and its full compliance with the restrictions intended to protect the environment and archaeological sites."
"As an MEP, I support the opportunity being offered to this area with all its problems."
"I firmly believe that responsible national government authorities will negotiate a level of licence fees which can revitalise and protect the RoÅia MontanÄ area with its gold deposits."
"As a Member State, Romania is entitled to mine its deposits in safe conditions ensuring protection for the environment, while also reaping the economic and social benefits commensurate with the natural assets it has."
"Cyanide is an extremely dangerous chemical used by the mining industry, despite the risks that it poses to the environment and human health."
"Ten years ago, more than 100 000 cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated water were accidentally discharged into the river system from a gold mine reservoir in Romania."
"This spill is responsible for one of the worst ever environmental disasters in Central Europe."
"For several years toxic substances there have endangered the ecological balance, the food chain and basic human requirements for the water from these rivers."
"There is nothing to stop an accident such as this from happening again."
"In Europe there are several mining projects using cyanide."
"A new disaster could happen at any time."
"It is simply a matter of time and of human negligence."
"Cyanide mining employs only a small workforce, but poses the risk of real environmental disasters."
"European environmental legislation enshrines the precautionary principle and requires the prevention and monitoring of water pollution."
"I therefore voted in favour of Parliament's resolution calling for a ban on the use of cyanide in the gold mines of the EU."
"I endorse and I voted in favour of this specific motion for a resolution, because the question of the use of cyanide mining technologies is extremely serious and requires immediate and decisive action, without prevarication."
"To date, the Commission has taken a very relaxed approach to the issue and that must change at once."
"This issue concerns numerous countries, the health of European citizens and environmental protection."
"The cases which have resulted from and consequences of the use of cyanide in mining, as in Romania and other countries, are well documented and extremely worrying."
"When I asked the Commission about the recent decision to create cyanide-based gold mines in Bulgaria, the Commission's reply increased my fears."
"Unfortunately, it would appear at present that cyanide may be used in northern Greece in three investment programmes by foreign companies."
"Finally, the Commission should propose a full ban on the use of cyanide in the EU within the next six months, so that it can be applied by the end of 2012 at the latest."
"Also, all Member States should undertake to ban the use of cyanide, as Hungary did recently."
"The European Parliament has adopted a resolution in favour of a general ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies by the end of 2011."
"The environmental consequences of cyanide pollution are transnational, and therefore this ban must apply at European level."
"For example, in January 2000, more than 100 000 cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated water escaped from a gold mine in Romania and polluted the rivers and streams of Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria."
"We hope that the Member States will stop supporting mining projects using cyanide-based technologies."
"At the same time, the Commission will have to encourage the industrial redevelopment of these areas with financial support for green substitute industries, renewable energies and tourism."
"In the Swedish gold mining industry, cyanide is used in closed systems in an environmentally sustainable way."
"It is degraded before water is released from the system and the best available technology (BAT) provides limit values that are well below internationally agreed safety levels."
"High safety standards prevent the cyanide from having any impact on the environment."
"These mines help to provide employment in sparsely populated areas, and as yet it has not been possible to develop alternative technology."
"Research and development should be encouraged in this area too, but in the current climate a ban would be disastrous from both a social and an economic perspective."
"We Social Democrats are working on a broad scale to get hazardous substances in food, the environment, manufacturing and so on phased out. Cyanide is one of these hazardous substances and the handling of cyanide is regulated for obvious reasons."
"In Sweden, all cyanide in mining is handled in closed processes and in a way which is considered to be safe."
"In other parts of the EU, the handling of the substance is not as strictly controlled."
"We chose to abstain in the final vote because we cannot support a hasty outright ban that would also penalise mining in those countries in which the handling of cyanide is considered to be safe."
"However, we would like the Commission to take immediate action to make processes involving the use of cyanide safe, to ensure that there are closed processes in all Member States and in the long term to phase out the use of cyanide in production by means of a ban."
"The particular toxicity of the use of cyanide and the effects of its use in mining, both for those using it and for fauna and flora surrounding the mines, demand a move towards the prohibition of its use in mining, for fear of increased numbers of cases of contamination, with disastrous consequences for people and the environment."
"Nonetheless, given the current needs of the mining industry, this prohibition cannot be immediate, so measures to minimise the environmental impact of cyanide use must be studied and introduced."
"I voted for this resolution because it proposes a general ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies in the European Union by the end of 2011, and because I understand that a ban constitutes, at the moment, the only reliable way of protecting our water resources and ecosystems from the pollution caused by the use of cyanide in mines."
"I would stress the need to oblige operating companies to take out insurance to cover compensation for damage and all remedial costs incurred in restoring a site to its original ecological and chemical status in the event of an accident or malfunction."
"I voted in favour of this text and am satisfied with the outcome of the vote because cyanide is an extremely toxic chemical that has potentially catastrophic and irreversible effects on the environment and human health."
"Cyanide also qualifies as a main pollutant under the Water Framework Directive (WFD)."
"Need I remind anyone that, in January 2000, more than 100 000 cubic metres of cyanide-contaminated water escaped from a gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania, and contaminated the SomeÅ, Tisza and Danube rivers?"
"It killed the fish and living organisms, and drinking water has been permanently contaminated in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria."
"Need I remind anyone that this incident is referred to as a 'second Chernobyl' due to the devastating impact it has had on the environment?"
"If we fail to adopt, in a simple joint motion for a resolution, a firm position in favour of a complete ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies in the European Union, then the message that we are sending out to the European Commission becomes meaningless for the future."
"There are times when environmental well-being, protection of natural heritage and human welfare generally manage to gain the upper hand even over economic and partisan interests."
"This is highlighted by this resolution."
"The European Parliament has managed to show today that it defends, first and foremost, the general interests and welfare of people."
"The use of cyanide technologies in mining poses a risk which we cannot afford to take as the effects are irreversible."
"However, I support the idea of encouraging industrial reconversion in areas where mining based on cyanide technologies has been banned, by providing sufficient financial support for 'clean' industrial sectors, as well as for renewable energy and tourism."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the use of cyanide in mining should be banned in Europe."
"Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical used in gold mining."
"It poses a serious threat to the environment and human health."
"The severe accidents in the past have proven that cyanide contamination can have an irreversible impact both on the environment and on human health."
"In this regard I strongly support the cause of banning this type of mining in the shortest possible term to ensure that no one, today or in the future, has to be exposed to the devastating impact of cyanide in mining."
"I voted against the resolution on banning the use of cyanide mining technologies by the end of 2011 for a number of reasons."
"Halting current mining projects using cyanide technologies would deal a severe blow to the Member States using this technology (Finland, Sweden, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece) and to the Member States which produce cyanides (Belgium, the UK, Czech Republic and Germany)."
"Europe would become 100% dependent on importing gold, a metal used in Europe's precious metals industry, as well as in the electronics sector."
"Approximately 87% of cyanide production is used in other industrial sectors outside the mining industry, such as the production of vitamins, jewellery, adhesives, electronic components for computers, fireproof insulation materials, cosmetics, nylon, paints, medicines, and so on. There are technologies in the economic sector which pose a hazard to human health and the environment."
"Cyanide technology is just one of them."
"Regulations and standards are in place to allow such activities to be carried out in safe conditions, in order to prevent any adverse impact."
"This principle applies to mining technology as well."
"There is legislation in force which must be respected."
"We do not have the right to ban, but we do have the right to protect."
"The EU was very explicit in the objectives set out in the Water Framework Directive regarding the quality of water resources, which must be free of any type of chemical agent."
"In order for these objectives to be met, a ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies is crucial."
"We have to replace this technique with environmentally friendly alternatives, as cyanide mining technologies are responsible for more than 30 serious accidents in the last 25 years."
"I voted against this resolution because the 2006 directive which is in force provides maximum protection to the environment and human health, with regard to the use of cyanide technologies in the mining industry."
"Given the directive's stringent provisions on mining residues and the lack of viable alternatives, there is no need to impose a blanket ban on the use of cyanide technologies for extracting gold."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the final text."
"The joint motion for resolution was adopted with only one small positive addition (encouraging industrial reconversion in areas where cyanide mining is banned)."
"The attempts to change the call for 'initiating a comprehensive ban' to just doing an impact assessment was rejected by roll-call vote (161/416), and so was the amendment to merely 'consider' a ban (roll-call vote: 246/337)."
"Our joint amendment with the S&D and GUE/NGL Groups to 'propose a ban' with a date when it should be effective was defeated (roll-call vote: 274/309)."
"The final resolution was adopted with 524/54/13 votes (the ALDE Group abstaining, as the change to the impact assessment was not adopted)."
"In yesterday's vote in the European Parliament on a general ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies in the European Union, like many other Swedish MEPs I voted against the motion for a resolution."
"Cyanides are toxic and it is extremely important for their use to be kept within the framework of established environmental guidelines and for leaching to be carried out in closed processes."
"This is standard practice in Europe and minimises the risk of hazardous emissions."
"An outright ban on the use of cyanide in mining would mean that the gold mines in Europe, including Sweden, would have to close."
"In my opinion, an outright ban on cyanide-based mining technology would be inadvisable until we have an alternative to cyanide leaching that is technically, economically and environmentally feasible."
"I therefore voted against the motion for a resolution."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Statements by the President"
"We have been saddened by news of the murder in Mexico of the Finnish international human rights observer Jyri Antero Jaakola."
"He and Mexican activist Betty CariÃ±o Trujillo, who was accompanying him at the time, were murdered during a mission to monitor the observance of human rights in Mexico."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I offer condolences and expressions of sympathy to the victims' families."
"As we can see, the world we live in still entails sacrifices such as these."
"I am sure you are aware that last week I made an official visit to the US."
"I officially opened Parliament's new Liaison Office with the United States Congress in Washington."
"I also had many important talks which should contribute to closer cooperation, especially economic cooperation, between the European Union and the United States."
"We also talked about strategic partnership and about the changes which have taken place in the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We expect cooperation with the United States to take place on equal terms."
"This Sunday, 9 May, is the 60th anniversary of the Schumann Declaration."

"Revision of the Treaties - Transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament - Decision not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the draft protocol amending Protocol No 36 on transitional provisions concerning the composition of the European Parliament for the rest of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term: the European Parliament's opinion (Article 48(3) of the EU Treaty) [17196/2009 - C7-0001/2010 - 2009/0813(NLE)], and"
"the report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the recommendation on the European Council's proposal not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament [17196/2009 - C7-0002/2010 - 2009/0814(NLE)]."
"Mr President, please allow me to begin my speech with a line from Rilke: 'Herr, es ist Zeit."
"Der Sommer war sehr groÃ...'."
"Rilke was the favourite poet of our recently deceased fellow Member, Dimitris Tsatsos."
"Some time ago now, on 19 November 1997, Dimitris Tsatsos and I had the honour of submitting the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this House."
"It was in that very report on the Treaty of Amsterdam that we proposed that any amendment to Treaties be prepared beforehand by a Convention."
"We called that the Community method."
"Indeed, it is that Convention method that was used in preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights and, above all, the Constitutional Treaty."
"I wish to remember Dimitris Tsatsos today in particular, as we are on the threshold of carrying out the first reform of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, in the last analysis, Mr President, is the Constitutional Treaty for which we fought so hard."
"That first reform, which is going to consist of the amendment of Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon, is caused by an anomaly because, at the time the elections to this Parliament were held in June last year, the Treaty of Lisbon had not come into force owing to the vicissitudes with which we are all familiar."
"Consequently, the last parliamentary elections were held under the Treaty of Nice, which was in force at that time, and said Treaty of Nice provides for the existence of 736 MEPs, as opposed to the 751 provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"To complicate matters even further, Mr President, the 1976 Act lays down that an MEP's mandate lasts for five years."
"This means that we cannot now simply apply the number laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, namely the 751 MEPs, given that under Lisbon a certain country loses three Members who have been elected and, therefore, cannot leave Parliament during this parliamentary term."
"That, Mr President, is why Protocol (No 36) has to be amended in order to enable the Lisbon agreements to come into force, and why during this parliamentary term, 2009-2014, when the amendment of Protocol (No 36) comes into force, this Parliament will, exceptionally, have 754 Members."
"That is why, Mr President, the European Council addressed a letter to you asking that, in accordance with Article 48(2) of the Treaty, this Parliament give its opinion on two questions."
"The first question is whether or not a Convention is necessary in order to prepare the amendment to Protocol (No 36)."
"The second is whether or not the Heads of State or Government can call an Intergovernmental Conference to amend Protocol (No 36)."
"Both questions are linked, although they are dealt with in two different reports."
"I will begin with the calling of an Intergovernmental Conference."
"As I have said, we are dealing with the political result of applying the Treaty of Lisbon and we are also dealing with a transitional and exceptional solution that will only last for the duration of this parliamentary term."
"Therefore, that Intergovernmental Conference will confine itself to something that has already been agreed: how to distribute those 18 MEPs among 12 countries."
"Consequently, Mr President, there is no debate."
"I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference can be very quickly called and can even resolve the issue in a single morning, given that the political decision has already been taken."
"For that reason, I am going to ask for a 'yes' vote for an Intergovernmental Conference and say that I do not believe that a Convention is required for an issue that has already been resolved."
"We are in favour of holding the Intergovernmental Conference; we are against calling a Convention."
"Mr President, I wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that the European Parliament, through the auspices of my dear colleague and friend, ÃÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo, shares the opinion of the European Council in the sense that in order to bring about the proposed change to Protocol (No 36) of the Treaty of Lisbon there is no need to call a Convention, given that we are dealing with a minor change, albeit one that is essential to enable the presence in this Chamber, before the next elections are held, of the number of MEPs that should have been here if the Treaty of Lisbon had been in force."
"This particular case is quite paradoxical, because both Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and I formed part of the Convention that drew up a Constitution for Europe."
"In this case, the aim is to try and avoid this procedure, given that we are dealing with a very minor change - just one of form, in fact - to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am delighted that in this way, if Parliament passes the motion put forward by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, and after an Intergovernmental Conference has been held and the corresponding ratification procedures have been completed in the 27 parliaments of the European Union Member States, a further 18 MEPs from 12 countries - the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Poland, the Netherlands, Malta, Latvia, Italy, Bulgaria, Sweden, France, Austria and Spain - can come as soon as possible."
"Therefore, the citizens of these countries will be even better represented in the European Parliament."
"That is why I am pleased that this report has been drawn up by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and that it has been adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs in the form that he proposed."
"I also hope that there will be widespread approval here at this plenary session and that we will be able to see these 18 missing MEPs here in Parliament as soon as possible, and that this will be provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo for an excellent report."
"I am also happy to be able to inform the European Parliament that the Commission adopted a positive opinion on the opening of the IGC that will examine the necessary Treaty changes that would endorse an additional 18 MEPs."
"The European Council had requested the opinion of the Commission acting on the proposal from the Spanish Government and, since the Spanish Government's proposal reflects the long-standing political agreement to bring the additional 18 MEPs into office without delay, the Commission has recommended opening an intergovernmental conference as soon as possible."
"In line with the Spanish proposal, the Commission has also stressed in its opinion that the IGC should be limited to dealing with the issue of the additional MEPs."
"I was very glad to see that that report by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo was supported by a strong majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and we hope that it will be the case in Parliament's sitting tomorrow."
"I would also like to express the hope of the Commission that the limited Treaty changes to be discussed at this IGC will be agreed quickly and the ratification by Member States will allow the additional 18 MEPs to take up their mandate as soon as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief since the committee I chair reached a very comprehensive agreement, in line with what has already been said, and so there is no need to make the debate too long-winded."
"The problem which arose and was discussed in committee mainly concerned the following: both the Electoral Act of 1976 and the Treaty of Lisbon require Members of this Parliament to be directly elected by the peoples of the various nations."
"This is a problem for cases in which the electoral system used to elect MEPs for this parliamentary term does not allow entry into Parliament of candidates who did not obtain enough votes to secure a seat, but did obtain enough votes to allow their entry at a later date."
"Some electoral systems do allow this, but it appears that others do not."
"Therefore, if we do not wish to considerably delay the integration of the Members into Parliament, we should have recourse to exceptional, transitional appointment systems, as envisaged by the Council."
"Following lengthy discussions, my committee concluded that this is a fair position."
"We therefore support what has already been said."
"Indeed, I must say that I personally tabled an amendment proposing the appointment of observers for an interim period prior to the election of the new Members to this Parliament. Although this amendment is still under discussion, we shall have to vote against it - even if it is my amendment - since the compromise amendment provides for the swift, immediate integration of the MEPs into Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that the decision we are taking on this occasion is not a light one."
"Firstly, we are revising the Treaty."
"Soon after it came into force, we are, for the first time, proposing a revision of the Treaty."
"This is no light matter."
"Secondly, however, what we are doing is restoring, confirming and creating the chance for 18 MEPs, who would have had the right to take their seats if the Treaty had been approved before the elections, to exercise that right."
"Moreover, we are enabling 12 countries that have the right to rearrange their situation in this Parliament, because they have an agreement with the entire European Union that they should have greater representation than at present, to exercise that right."
"That is all this is about, but it is an important question."
"Nevertheless, the Treaty itself requires that a Convention be held to revise the Treaty."
"The Council quite reasonably asks us if it is necessary to hold a Convention in order to ratify an agreement reached with all of the EU Member States."
"Parliament responds that there is no need."
"There is no need on this occasion."
"It therefore mandates the Council to convene an Intergovernmental Conference and to revise the Treaty, thus giving rise to the possibility that the 27 countries ratify the revision, thereby enabling the 18 MEPs to come here and the 12 countries involved to attain their full level of parliamentary representation."
"This is what we are dealing with, but there is a problem."
"To begin with, I would like to acknowledge the fact that we had some difficulty when it came to determining if those who are coming necessarily have to be directly elected for these seats, or if they can be elected in some other way."
"I think that this problem that has come up, which must be examined and presented realistically, has been satisfactorily resolved."
"I wish to thank not only the rapporteur for the report, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, but Mr Duff also, for the fact that we have managed to come to what is, in my view, a very important agreement among the three groups."
"What we say is, yes, let the Treaty be revised, but without a Convention, so that a start can be made to the right to that confirmation."
"At the same time, however, this House would remind the national parliaments that they must send Members who have been directly elected to the European Parliament, and that here in Parliament we intend to carry out a revision of the European electoral system in order to endow the European electoral model with a unified, supranational system for electing its Members."
"I am delighted that these two considerations have enabled a balance to be struck, so that this matter can be reopened."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the proposal before us of course precedes the Treaty being brought into force."
"If the Treaty had been brought into being before such a proposal had come forward we would not have accepted it."
"Parliament could not accept the fact that France would be seeking to appoint two deputies from the AssemblÃ©e Nationale to Parliament."
"And if we had agreed this after the Treaty had come onto force - if this proposal had not come forward before it had been brought into force - we would also have been in breach of the Treaty because this proposal does not respect the principle of digressive proportionality."
"We are accepting a transitional solution, but the controversy has been quite successful in exposing the problems concerning Parliament's composition and electoral procedure."
"I am pleased that all our groups now agree that a substantial reform of the electoral procedure is now required, and Parliament will soon be bringing forward proposals which are going to require an IGC, which will be fully and properly prepared by a Convention that will include national parliaments, will be broadly consultative and include national political parties to conclude a substantial settlement of this issue in time for 2014."
"I am extremely grateful to my colleagues and coordinators of the other groups for the constructive negotiations which have been concluded by a firm intent to reform the electoral procedure of Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have a broad consensus on this matter."
"We look forward to the enlargement of Parliament and we look forward to 18 new Members."
"We want to create the conditions for this now so that they can come and work together with us."
"There is only one small difference of opinion, which in truth is actually very large, because it concerns the basis of our work, including our understanding of the principle of democracy and our appreciation of this House itself."
"It concerns the question of who decides who these new Members will be."
"For us, that is not a secondary issue, it is a key question."
"According to the Treaty, Members of the European Parliament 'shall be elected for a term of five years by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot'."
"It is the citizens who do the electing."
"In 11 out of 12 countries that is what has happened."
"One country is now saying that that is not possible and that they will send us MEPs who were elected by their citizens for a totally different job."
"We do not consider that to be a satisfactory way to treat Parliament or the right of the citizens to vote and the principle of democracy."
"We could dispense with a convention if this were merely a technical issue, in other words if we had agreed on the principle of compliance with the Treaties."
"However, at this point the Treaty is at risk of collapsing."
"Let us insist on the convening of a convention, which is a wonderful method of achieving consensus outside of the level of governments in Europe on precisely these types of questions."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I welcome this report and its conclusion that there is no need for a constitutional convention."
"Such a convention would merely serve to waste time and taxpayers' money."
"Indeed, there is no appetite amongst my constituents for a convention which would no doubt discuss further political integration."
"Indeed, the balance of opinion in Britain is that political union has already progressed too far."
"Whilst I welcome the measures that enable the 18 additional MEPs to take their seats, I do not believe that they should enjoy observer status until the transitional provisions come into force."
"Such a move would entitle them to claim their salaries and expenses before they are entitled to vote, and I believe, as a matter of principle, that that is wrong."
"At a time when large cuts in public expenditure are anticipated in almost every Member State, this Parliament should set an example."
"We should be prudent with public money at all times."
"My group will vote against this report because it disregards that important principle."
"Mr President, we disagree on many things where the EU is concerned."
"We doubtless also disagree on many things where the European Parliament is concerned."
"However, I believe that there is broad consensus that what gives the European Parliament legitimacy is that it is democratically and directly elected by the citizens."
"So, here we are today with a proposal that forces us to face the fact that this can change."
"A proposal is on the table that could put us in a situation in which, in the next four years, things can be adopted in this Parliament by people who have not been democratically elected, but rather appointed."
"I think this is a very bad development."
"I also think it is a very unfortunate development."
"It is, of course, contrary to the Treaty."
"We would therefore have to revise the Treaty."
"However, it is also contrary to what we actually do in practice."
"When Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, did we tell them that they did not need to hold elections?"
"Did we say that the Members from these countries could sit for two-and-a-half years without elections being held?"
"No, we instructed them to hold elections, and that is what should be done in the case of new Members."
"This should be the case even if elections are to be held in only one country, for example in France."
"Mr President, there is something bizarre about the situation that we find ourselves in right now."
"For years we have heard how the Treaty of Lisbon would be the instrument to ensure democracy, transparency and citizens' influence on legislation in the EU."
"Then one of the first things the European Parliament chooses to do after telling citizens this for years is to say no to direct elections, no to convening a convention and no to all of the instruments that we have used in the past to convince citizens why this Treaty was necessary."
"There is something rather strange about this."
"The natural thing to do, of course, would be for us to take seriously the promises we made to the electorate, to take seriously the fact that this House should be made up of people with a direct popular mandate, and to take seriously the fact that it is not governments but elected representatives who change the Treaties."
"Both of these fundamental elements - and, incidentally, fundamental promises - will be destroyed if the two reports are adopted."
"The whole idea, indeed the whole argument for having the Treaty of Lisbon - everything that was intended to convince citizens why they should give even more power to the EU - is precisely what we are turning our back on today now that we have got what we wanted."
"Like the previous speaker, I therefore have to say that my group cannot support these reports."
"(FR) Mr President, I shall come straight to the point."
"Paragraph 2 of Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo's report rightly emphasises the fact that one of the Council's proposals goes completely against the spirit of the 1976 Act."
"It concerns the appointment, by the national parliaments, of MEPs who, under the 1976 Act, must be elected by direct universal suffrage."
"With all due respect to the rapporteur, I regret that he has not taken greater account of this and addressed it in a stricter, clearer and more uncompromising way in paragraph 5."
"It is not at all impossible to stick to the election."
"If the Member States do not wish to hold by-elections, they should simply consider the outcome of the election that took place in 2009 and apply, on a proportionate basis, the outcome of that vote to the new number of MEPs who have just been assigned to them."
"Any other solution is undemocratic, especially in my country, France, where the national parliament is appointed on a non-proportional basis, without proportional rule."
"This would be, in fact, a form of governmental appointment that goes against the spirit of the Treaties."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is still a mystery how the Council could have treated an issue such as this so lightly."
"I hope that this unfortunate hitch will not leave problems in its wake and that the credibility of our institutions and our project will not be undermined."
"I shall give you a specific example: Italy is required to elect one MEP in a possible additional election, but should we be more concerned that we would have an election with a likely turnout of no more than 5% of the electorate, or that we would refer to the results of the last elections of 2009 in order to confirm the election of an MEP elected, in any case, by direct universal suffrage?"
"At all events, we must not make the situation worse: never before has it been more important for Europe to avoid institutional obstacles and delays in the process of integration."
"I, too, would highlight how important it is for all 18 MEPs to take up their seats in the European Parliament at the same time, in order to avoid upsetting the delicate balance between the nationalities represented in the House."
"This is a question - I repeat - that must be resolved immediately: I find it unthinkable that the new Members may not be elected to Parliament for the remainder of the 2009-2014 term."
"Therefore, we must urgently adopt the recommendation and report in question so that amendment of Protocol No 36 to the Treaty of Lisbon will be given the go-ahead, without convening a convention, but by directly convening an intergovernmental conference, as proposed by the rapporteur."
"Indeed, we must take the quickest path, because at this stage there is little to discuss."
"Instead, we need to turn the page and make a fresh, constructive start following what has been, unfortunately, a very negative episode."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo."
"I see no need to convene a convention."
"It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified."
"Since 1979, the European Parliament has been elected in a direct and secret ballot and that is the way it should continue to be done in future, too."
"We and the Council would be well advised to deal with this problem as quickly as possible at an intergovernmental conference, because out of the 18 Members, 16 are in a state of suspense, which is rather intolerable."
"The ball is therefore back in the Council's court."
"I would ask the Council not to give in on this point because one Member State has failed to find clear rules on account of it expecting the Treaty of Lisbon to enter into force sooner."
"I am pleased that we now have this Treaty in place, but we now have our homework to do."
"The MÃ©ndez de Vigo report is a good basis for strengthening this process."
"However, the Council would be well advised not to succumb to the temptation to accept Members being sent here from a national parliament."
"That would set a precedent and I am not happy to accept that."
"Therefore, the rapporteur has my full support, with the proviso that no Members be sent here from national parliaments."
"(FR) Madam President, France is the only Member State that did not anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and that is refusing to abide by the outcome of the European elections of June 2009."
"By accepting the third option - the French exception - of appointing two new MEPs, we are being asked to endorse a serious violation of the Union's primary legislation: the election of Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, from which we have derived our legitimacy for 31 years."
"Are we going to abide by the Council's decision, under pressure from one Member State, which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens?"
"Our Parliament must not sanction this serious breach of the principle of European democracy."
"We must refuse to undermine our legitimacy and our credibility as elected representatives of the European public."
"It is the European citizens who choose who they want to represent them in the European Parliament, not the governments of the Member States."
"This French exception justifies our demand for Parliament to be involved, in the case of a convention on the revision of the Treaties, and to reject any intergovernmental conference."
"Madam President, delaying ratifying the Lisbon Treaty meant that 736 MEPs were appointed rather than the 751 now proposed."
"This higher number is to be achieved by 18 seats being distributed amongst 12 Member States and Germany losing three seats, but this cannot take place as it is unlawful to prematurely curtail the mandate of the three German MEPs."
"A further complication is that the Treaty stipulates the total number of MEPs shall not exceed 751."
"To include the 18 additional MEPs without losing the three German seats will require a revision of Protocol 36 of the Lisbon Treaty."
"This should be achieved by a convention producing proposals for agreement by Member States for incorporation into the Treaty by way of amendment."
"Failure to do this would render unlawful any act this Parliament takes on the basis of a 754-strong Chamber - three over the limit of 751."
"The proposal before this House is that this problem be dealt with by way of an intergovernmental conference, but this is a significant revision and amendment to the Lisbon Treaty requiring ratification by all Member States and providing the opportunity for individual national referenda."
"I urge this House to oppose this proposal."
"Madam President, I strongly disagree with the previous speaker."
"This House had to answer a question on whether or not we should convene a convention to decide that issue, and we have taken a decision not to do so, but we have done so out of respect for this instrument - for this new instrument, which actually increases the legitimacy of all the decisions which we make."
"Obviously that does not set a precedent for the future, because all the really important issues concerning the changes to the Treaty, such as for example the electoral procedure, would require the convening of a convention."
"Let me thank ÃÃ±igo and the coordinators for taking the decision."
"It was not easy."
"We had a problem with designating an additional 18 Members of this House because certain Member States did not actually plan for a procedure, but we decided that representativeness is the most important issue, that this is the principle which we should be guided by and that this House should have a balanced representation as quickly as possible."
"That is why we took a pragmatic solution, prompting Member States to complete their election procedures as quickly as possible, provided, obviously, that all the parliamentarians who are going to join us are going to be directly elected."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of appointing additional MEPs is not new; let us remember that our fellow Members Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure already worked on this matter during the previous parliamentary term."
"How, then, can one fail to be surprised at the total lack of preparation of a country - mine, as it happens, France - with regard to the appointment of its two new MEPs?"
"Could it not have reasonably assumed that the Treaty of Lisbon would one day enter into force and that the issue of the new MEPs would be raised?"
"What explains, then, such a lack of foresight, such a casual attitude?"
"The fact is, by offering France the possibility, under the draft Protocol No 36, to go ahead and appoint MEPs within the national parliament - thereby allowing it to save face at little cost - we actually risk infringing the fundamental rule that stipulates that Members of the European Parliament must be elected by direct universal suffrage."
"This goes against the spirit of the 1976 Act on the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, and would undermine the very legitimacy and credibility of the European Parliament."
"On the other hand, for their part, the elected representatives of the 11 other Member States who have been duly elected must not pay the price for such amateurishness."
"This situation has simply gone on for too long, for them and for their countries, and it is only right that these elected representatives be able to join us as quickly as possible and set to work."
"That is why we believe that this issue should be resolved via an intergovernmental conference that could quickly approve the appointment of these Members."
"However, we must insist that France fulfils its obligations just as its European partners have."
"Arrangements of this kind are unacceptable in the heart of the Chamber that brings together the representatives of the European people."
"In spite of everything, this debate will have had the virtue of implicitly demonstrating the need to make provision, in the future, for a uniform means of electing MEPs by direct universal suffrage."
"This reform will, for its part, have to be achieved by means of a convention."
"Once again, it is the voice of the peoples that must carry weight here, in this Chamber, not that of the governments."
"Madam President, I would like to thank ÃÃ±igo for doing a great job and all those colleagues who took part for their cooperation."
"After many years of work and quite serious ratification problems, the Treaty of Lisbon is finally in force."
"It gives much-needed reinforcement to the role of the European Parliament."
"We must take this opportunity seriously and base our actions on these acquired institutional reforms."
"We need to concentrate on progressive decision-making for the benefit of all European citizens."
"We should not take so much time on administrative matters."
"I am the type of person who is a quick, efficient but good decision-maker."
"European citizens rightfully expect us to do our job efficiently and transparently."
"I fully respect the balance and good cooperation among the European institutions, even though I am convinced that the proposed compromise reflects a viable solution."
"This way we can do our job more efficiently."
"We will therefore be strengthening the European Parliament and doing a great service for European citizens."
"Last, but not least, I personally know some of the already-elected future colleagues, and the sooner they can start working the better."
"I strongly believe that their expertise will give an added value to our institutions."
"(FR) Madam President, I too wanted to follow other speakers in thanking our colleague, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo."
"He has done an outstanding job in circumstances that were at times fiery, and always exciting."
"The debates within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have lasted a long time; they have been equal to the challenge and equal to the intense and important character that MEPs associate, of course - and rightly so - with a major issue that has immediate implications for them, namely the composition of our Parliament and the methods of appointing its Members."
"Once again, the rapporteur has been able to compile what were at times differing opinions and contributions and to summarise them - I would say - in an extremely balanced text."
"I would like to thank him for this."
"I believe that the recommendations made in these two reports, both in the one on convening an intergovernmental conference and in the one on the transitional measures concerning the composition of our Parliament, are characterised by realism, pragmatism and effectiveness."
"I believe that, on this and other issues too, this is by and large what our fellow citizens expect of Europe."
"(DE) Madam President, I too should like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, and also to all of the shadow rapporteurs."
"As Parliament, we should send out a clear signal today that we are very much looking forward to having the new Members here in Parliament and that the Council is indeed remiss."
"It should once again be highlighted here that we have the very clear task of finding a solution as quickly as possible so that freely elected Members - 18 of them in fact - can start their work as soon as possible."
"As Parliament, we have not only the very general task of representing the people in the best way possible but also the job of working as efficiently and effectively as possible in the committees, and to do this we also expect to draw on the expertise and knowledge of those fellow Members who have largely already been freely and properly elected."
"As an Austrian, I very much look forward to seeing Joe Weidenholzer here and I hope that we shall be able to welcome him here as a Member of Parliament as soon as possible."
"(DE) Madam President, the ink is barely dry on the abortive Treaty of Lisbon and already the next amendments have been tabled, and the chaos surrounding our new Members - people are talking about phantom Members - is truly perfect."
"This has of course been caused, among other things, by our different election systems, which give rise to democracy-related problems."
"In France, for example, where candidates stand at a regional level and no lists are available, it is not very difficult to allow Members to move up."
"We should speak out clearly in favour of an election and not selection by a parliament."
"Secondly, it would also make perfect sense - and this is what the citizens expect - for us to provide specific information on the activities and earnings of Members during the observation period."
"This 'phantom' situation will certainly not do much for citizens' confidence in the EU."
"We also need to provide clarification as quickly as possible as to when the new Members should come and what status they should have."
"Moreover, it is still not clear whether the Treaty of Lisbon will be re-examined - which would be desirable - and what the situation is with regard to Croatia's accession."
"Citizens expect a quick resolution of this matter by the Council."
"(PL) Under the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the composition of the European Parliament has changed."
"Despite the fact that it entered into force six months ago now, an intergovernmental conference to implement these changes still has not been convened."
"The Member States have to ratify a special protocol concerning the additional number of Members of the European Parliament."
"This is a big operation, but it does not alter the fact that the Treaty must be implemented in full and without delay."
"I share the position presented on this matter by the rapporteur."
"It should be remembered that it is in the interest of those Member States which have an increased national delegation under the provisions of the Treaty for their new Members to be able to represent their electorate as soon as possible."
"This is in accord with the fundamental democratic principles upon which the Union is based."
"It is important that all the additional Members enter Parliament at the same time, in order for our institution to avoid accusations of functioning improperly."
"(SL) I, too, would like to join those of you who wish to emphasise the need for the European Parliament to be fully representative and to work with a full complement of members as soon as possible."
"I believe that we are still not fully represented given the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, which is our constitution."
"I also think that the Intergovernmental Conference would be the right path to follow, and the quickest way, to enable us to consolidate our legal basis and to permit the European Parliament to achieve full representation."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, who has been exploring legal bases, and I think that today's resolution does indeed express them well."
"In addition, I join those of you who are looking forward to welcoming new Members to the European Parliament as I think that we need them."
"To those of you who did not foresee in your own elections, the last European elections, that it would be necessary to appoint, or rather, elect, additional Members, to you I say that this House will not lose any legitimacy just because two Members will come from national parliaments."
"Madam President, like other colleagues, I think that if people are elected to the European Parliament they are entitled to take their seats just the same as the 736 Members have taken their seats in the last 12 months."
"This is a short-term problem which needs a short-term solution, because in four years' time everything will have settled down and will work normally."
"I also think it is wrong to blame Member States for not taking anticipated action 12 months ago because 12 months ago there was a strong possibility that the Lisbon Treaty would not be ratified, and certainly that was a position which many people felt in my own country and in other countries."
"But, now that everything has been ratified, it is important that the people who have been elected be allowed to take their seats so that they can contribute to Parliament and we can get on until the next election in four years' time, when everything will be, as they say, 'hunky-dory'."
"Madam President, I would merely like to add that I agree with those speeches made by honourable Members who have expressed the importance of resolving this outstanding issue as regards the Treaty of Lisbon, namely, the case of the 18 MEPs who have still to take their seats in Parliament because the last elections were held a little before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"Therefore, this revision of Protocol (No 36) is worthwhile."
"I also wholly agree with those who feel that it should be done at the earliest opportunity and that the absence in this Parliament of 18 MEPs who represent the citizens of 12 Member States be remedied as quickly as possible."
"That is why, in the last analysis, I agree with Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, who proposes that there is no need for a Convention, that an Intergovernmental Conference be called as soon as possible, that the 27 Member States' parliaments ratify the decision at the earliest opportunity, and that, as a result, the 18 MEPs in question can be seen in this Parliament, as they should have been here from the outset of this parliamentary term."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I think that this debate has clearly demonstrated that we are trying to resolve an exceptional situation, that we are looking for a practical solution and that this is the solution for the transition."
"Therefore I very much welcome the pragmatic approach of Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and the report which he prepared, and, as I can gather from the debate, it is also getting very strong support here in the plenary."
"I think it is very clear that our common goal is to have 18 new MEPs as soon as possible."
"Coming back to the Commission's position, I think we have been asked very straightforward questions about how this change should be administered and through which instrument."
"The Commission has agreed very clearly to the IGC because of the scope and nature of the change which will be discussed."
"As regards the modalities of how the additional MEPs are chosen, this would be, I am sure, raised within the framework of an intergovernmental conference, but let me add: when the European Council was considering this matter, I think that it was quite clear that the Council was looking to seek a balance, a balance between the natural desirability that the additional MEPs are chosen in a way as close as possible to the European Parliament elections themselves and the need to respect national constitutional arrangements; that is the origin of the three options to cover the realities of today's situation which of course will be regularised at the next elections."
"To conclude let me also welcome the internal reflections within the European Parliament about possible future changes to the European elections, but I think that we have to underline that these are, and should remain, different issues."
"Today we are discussing how to get 18 additional MEPs into the European Parliament."
"Next time we will be discussing possible changes to the electoral vote."
"Madam President, when people coming from positions as different and far-removed as those of Mr Mauro, Mr Gollnisch and Mr Colman come to the conclusion that there are problems with the electoral procedure and systems for the election of MEPs to the European Parliament, it means that we need a uniform electoral procedure."
"That was a mandate that already existed in the Treaties of Rome."
"Therefore, we coordinators - and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them, most especially Mr JÃ¡uregui and Mr Duff - have agreed on Amendment 2, which will be voted on tomorrow."
"I hope that this amendment will be supported by this House, particularly so that we can soon resolve this issue of a uniform electoral procedure for elections to the European Parliament."
"By means of this, we would, it seems to me, remove this type of question mark."
"In his speech, Mr Trzaskowski spoke about the necessary representativeness of this Parliament, something that the majority of the speakers and Vice-President Å efÄoviÄ, among others, have also highlighted."
"I agree."
"Indeed, we say as much in paragraph 1 of the report, to the extent that the 18 MEPs should enter en bloc, otherwise we would lose representativeness."
"In order for them to enter en bloc, in order to comply with this act of political justice that is the Treaty of Lisbon, we have to be practical, because a transitional and exceptional situation, ladies and gentlemen, also requires transitional and exceptional situations and solutions."
"This is why, and I am quite open about it, I do not like the possibility of MEPs joining this Parliament who were not elected in 2009, something which, by the way, I clearly state in paragraph 2 of the report."
"Nevertheless, if I have to choose between that and the 18 Members not taking their seats, or coming up with a practical solution and the 18 joining, meaning therefore that we comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, I ask this House, as I have already done in the report, to choose that solution; a transitional and pragmatic one but, above all, Madam President, a just one."
"I would like to thank everyone for their collaboration and for the interesting contributions that were made to this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 6 May 2010 at 11.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I feel that it is not equitable that those countries which have been allocated additional seats in the EP are not yet represented."
"I am not talking only on behalf of Malta which has been allocated the 6th seat but also with regards to all the other countries which found themselves in the same position."
"It is a fact that there are legal and constitutional constraints to be overcome in order for the new European parliamentarians to take their rightful seats."
"On the other hand the time which has elapsed from the EP elections of June 2009 illustrates that the EU has become a cumbersome institution which takes months, if not years, to activate parts of the Lisbon Treaty which was finally approved less than 6 months ago."
"Apart from the deficiency in representation regarding the countries involved, there is another element which I feel requires immediate attention."
"I am referring to the human element."
"Eighteen prospective parliamentarians must be going through a very difficult period in their life especially from the psychological point of view."
"I am sure that there isn't one present European parliamentarian who does not understand the plight of these eighteen politicians."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament is under an obligation to decide as quickly as possible about this, to enable our future fellow Members, who have been democratically elected, to take their seats."
"This is extremely important, not only for their sakes, but principally out of respect for the decisions made by their voters."
"We must not force them to wait any longer."
"All of our new fellow Members should be chosen in democratic elections."
"I am aware of the fact that at the present moment significant differences exist between the electoral rules in different Member States."
"Therefore, I would like to express the hope that the current situation will motivate us to begin a dialogue about harmonising electoral procedures in EU Member States."
"in writing. - We would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent job."
"However, we are disappointed with the French decision to alter the original will of the European electorate by appointing new Members of the European Parliament from the National Assembly."
"Ceterum censeo - France has decided to sell a Mistral-class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action."
"Preparation of the Summit of Heads of State or Government of the euro area (7 May 2010) (debate)"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation of the Summit of Heads of State or Government of the euro area (7 May 2010)."
"Mr President, this week, on 7 May, there is going to be a meeting of Heads of State or Government of the euro area, and this is the debate in the European Parliament regarding this important meeting."
"The aim of the meeting will be to formalise the agreement reached on loans to Greece, the financial support package for Greece to tackle the serious financial situation of this euro-area country, and to reflect on the lessons that can be learned from this situation and these agreements in relation to the future of the euro area and of the whole of the European Union."
"What the Heads of State or Government are going to do on Friday is confirm the financial solution that the European Union has given to Greece."
"In other words it is going to formalise the commitment - which at this stage is a political commitment - made at the meeting of European Union Heads of State or Government on 11 February, a commitment to support Greece in resolving its extremely difficult financial situation."
"Therefore, what the Heads of State or Government are going to do on Friday is to present, set out and agree the will of the 15 other Member States in the euro area for Greece to receive this aid, these loans, once its Government has adopted a stringent programme of economic and financial adjustments."
"They are aimed at ensuring Greece's financial stability and the financial stability of the euro area as a whole, which is something that was agreed politically not only for the case of Greece, but was agreed politically on 11 February in a resolution by the European Union Heads of State or Government."
"This is an important decision, politically and historically speaking, because it is essential for the credibility of the euro area and for the external credibility of the whole of the Union from a financial point of view."
"It is important for the fiscal consolidation required by the Treaties on European Union, fiscal consolidation in the euro area and in the whole of the Union, and it is very important for consolidating an effective and lasting economic recovery in the European Union."
"Today Mr Rehn, who is here with us, published the Commission's forecasts for 2010-2011, sending a message of gradual economic recovery for the European Union."
"The Commission's forecasts confirm that the economic recovery is happening in the European Union and that after experiencing the biggest recession in its history, the European Union as a whole is forecast growth of 1% in 2010 - this year - and 1.75% in 2011."
"Therefore, the economic recession came to an end in the European Union in the third quarter of last year and economic recovery has begun."
"The European Economic Recovery Plan and the decisions made by the Member States have made a clear contribution to this by injecting large amounts of money into the economies of the various countries from the budgets of the Member States and from the Union budget, through the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"This is one of the reasons why - I will say it again - after going through the worst recession in its history, we are already seeing economic recovery in the Union."
"These are the European Commission's forecasts, and undoubtedly the decision to lend to Greece is making a decisive contribution to ensuring that the economic recovery in the euro area and in the whole of the European Union is both effective and lasting."
"We believe that the European Union has responded well to the current economic situation, to the economic crisis, by doing everything in its power to respond to the situation."
"Specifically, we think that it has responded well to the extremely serious financial situation in Greece, because what the European Union has definitely done in recent months has been to take clear steps towards what we have begun to describe as the economic governance or the economic government of the Union."
"Clear steps forward have been taken."
"At times they may have seemed slow, too slow, but steps forward have been taken, in any case, in a secure, determined manner, which will culminate on Friday in the meeting of the European Union Heads of State or Government."
"We believe that the economic governance, the economic government of the Union needs to have solid foundations."
"The first of these is taking responsibility for the commitments made, for example when a Treaty on European Union is signed and ratified."
"The second is solidarity, which is a principle that is at the heart of the European Union and of all of its policies."
"The third is coordination of fiscal consolidation, coordination in the external representation of the European Union - for example, looking towards the G20 meetings - and coordination for growth and getting out of the crisis."
"I am convinced that this is what will be said in the document that Commissioner Rehn is preparing on the subject and will present to the Commission on 12 May."
"Finally, I would like to say that the economic governance of the Union that is being established and developed, and for which the foundations are being laid in the European Union, requires effective instruments and an element of supervision."
"I am certain that the document that the European Commission is preparing will refer to this."
"We need quality in public finances."
"We need supervision of the financial system, European supervision of the financial system, and in this respect I would like to call on the European Parliament to adopt a financial supervision package as soon as possible."
"This package should involve the regulations and directives that are being debated here and now in Parliament, and are going to be debated in the relevant committee in the next few days and then in the relevant plenary sitting."
"We also need mechanisms to prevent possible crises, and we also need - as I said before - the capacity to have a single voice in the external representation of the Union, and in this case I am clearly talking about the G20 meetings."
"I think that these are steps that are being taken towards an economic government or governance of the Union; the aid and loans to Greece are part of this, and this is why I believe that the European Union is going in the right direction and has consolidated that direction."
"I am certain that the Heads of State or Government will adopt this financial aid package for Greece, which is, in short, as they said in their statement on 11 February, a commitment to financial stability, to the economic stability of the euro area and of the whole of the European Union."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I was asked to make a statement to this House ahead of Friday's meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area."
"Let me first say a word of condolence for the families of the victims of the violence in Athens today."
"To disagree and protest is a right of citizens in our democratic societies, but nothing can justify the recourse to violence."
"Let me address the financial support package for Greece endorsed last Sunday."
"Then I will give you some of my views on what needs to be done to prevent a repetition of a crisis of this type."
"As regards Greece, a multi-annual programme of fiscal consolidation and structural reform has been agreed by the Greek authorities."
"This was jointly prepared with the Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund."
"The Greek Government has put forward a solid and credible package that will steer its economy on a sustainable path and restore confidence."
"It is important that we acknowledge the courage that Prime Minister Papandreou and his Government have shown."
"Greece will undertake painful efforts, but we all know that there are no alternatives to such efforts."
"In return, following the recommendation of the Commission and of the European Central Bank, the coordinated European mechanism for assistance to Greece has been activated."
"This is an unprecedented act of solidarity, unmatched anywhere in the world."
"This assistance will be decisive in helping Greece to get its economy back on track and will preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole."
"Allow me to stress that the Commission has made sure that the mechanism, whilst being based on bilateral loans, is a European one."
"The Commission was instrumental in setting it up and will play an important role in its management and implementation."
"The Commission is, and will remain, central in assessing Greece's compliance with the package's conditionality."
"The Commission will also manage the bilateral loans from the Member States."
"By the end of the week we will already have a critical mass of Member States that have completed the process to provide those bilateral loans to Greece."
"It is my firm conviction that the unprecedented financial support given to Greece - EUR 110 billion - and the adjustment programme are an adequate response to the Greek crisis."
"We have no reason to doubt that it will be firmly implemented both by Greece and by the euro-area Member States."
"This view is shared by others who matter."
"I noticed, for instance, the supportive statement of the past, current and future Chairs of the G20 Finance Ministers, issued just now."
"Regrettably, not all market players seem convinced already."
"We have to say loud and clear that the doubters are wrong."
"I will come back to this in a moment."
"At the meeting of the euro-area Heads of State and Government on Friday, we will look beyond this deal to what we need to do to draw the right lessons from this situation."
"The debate will of course be a starting point, because decisions need to be debated further and ultimately taken with all the 27 Member States - the euro-area Member States but also all the other Member States of the European Union."
"Let me say this very clearly: discussing and taking decisions at 27 is a source of strength."
"Whilst we have to speed up our processes, the fact is that the joint action of the 27 - unparalleled anywhere in the world - provides the best possible foundation for our joint future in an ever more interlinked world."
"I see two main strands for reflection and action: first, a reassessment of the rules for economic governance, including the Stability and Growth Pact, and second, financial markets reform."
"The Commission has been working intensively on economic governance and is ready to present its proposals on how to improve this next Wednesday."
"There are three main building blocks to be considered."
"First, responsibility: we need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, Member States' compliance."
"The case for reinforcement of both the preventive and the corrective arm of the pact is obvious."
"I am pleased that most of those who have previously questioned - or even suggested weakening - the pact now accept the need for stronger rules and - most importantly - for their strict implementation."
"Second, interdependence: we are all in this together."
"I think the crisis has clearly shown that we need to address the imbalances between our Member States, in particular within the euro area."
"This includes divergences in their competitiveness, as this is one crucial element that causes other types of imbalances."
"This cannot, of course, mean that some become less competitive so that others look relatively more competitive."
"We are all competing on world markets."
"What we need is to enhance our overall competitiveness in a balanced, mutually reinforcing way."
"I also believe we need to look at the other causes of imbalances."
"To make progress, we will propose increased surveillance and increased economic policy coordination."
"I am also happy that I see more openness now when it comes to the Member States for this purpose."
"Third, coherence: we have to ask ourselves whether our system of fiscal rules is complete."
"I see merit in creating a permanent mechanism for dealing with disruptive situations."
"After all, it is better to be safe than sorry."
"I hope that we can seize the moment - and I count on you to help us deliver these reforms."
"I believe from a political point of view that, in terms of European integration, we are at one of those moments where, if we do not build up Europe, we will fall behind."
"We cannot have a standstill."
"It is a very special moment, the moment we are living today in Europe where our solidarity, our responsibility, is being tested every day."
"I hope the leaders of our Member States will be able to rise to the occasion, not just to help the others but to show their responsibility to our common European project."
"These reforms will be introduced against the background of unprecedented efforts already under way."
"That deficit and debt levels in some Member States need to be corrected with determination, and faster than targeted before the crisis, is undisputed."
"But it must also be said that we cannot ignore the fact that the budgetary deterioration in 2009 was largely due to the working of the automatic stabilisers in the face of an unprecedented decline in economic activity caused by a financial crisis not originating in Europe."
"In other words, the overall situation in the euro area was largely the result of anti-recession policies advocated all over the world."
"It was always clear that the situation would subsequently be corrected, and most euro-area members have already undertaken bold reforms, for example of their pensions systems."
"The responsibility shown by the governments needs to be matched by financial-market players."
"This is why it is no less urgent to continue delivering a sustainable and responsible financial sector, at the service of the economy and its citizens."
"One must bear in mind that financial-market players are key actors in driving market sentiment."
"Psychology also matters in markets."
"The financial crisis was born out of short-termism, pro-cyclicality and a lack of responsibility."
"That is what we must urgently correct."
"We need strong and stable European financial services markets to deliver the investments needed for future growth in line with the Europe 2020 vision."
"We need responsible behaviour from all our market players."
"We have already been doing a lot as regards financial markets reform."
"I count on this House to make this clear to all."
"European institutions are acting, and must be seen as acting together: Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"We have prioritised work on responsible risk management, safer derivatives markets, better financial supervision and ensuring that banks hold adequate capital to cover their real risks."
"This work must be speeded up."
"In the coming weeks we will need to complete the reforms already under way."
"As I said to this House only two weeks ago, I hope to see a breakthrough soon on our proposal for hedge funds and private equity."
"I would also like early agreement on effective new European supervisory arrangements."
"The European Systemic Risk Board and the three supervisory authorities should start working at the beginning of 2011."
"But they must not be mere paper tigers: we have a shared responsibility to ensure they have the tools they need to do their jobs."
"This includes binding decision-making powers to deal with genuine emergencies, to enforce European rules - and I insist on European rules, not only national rules - and to settle any disputes within the colleges of national supervisors."
"It is high time to deliver these decisions and make sure they are ambitious."
"More proposals are on their way this year to improve depositor and investor protection, to strengthen measures against market abuse, to further improve the quality and quantity of bank capital and discourage excessive leverage."
"Over the past three months, and paradoxically still this week, the situation on the sovereign debt markets has brought new concerns to light."
"The Commission is already working on a fundamental overhaul of derivatives markets to increase transparency and safety in these markets."
"In a first stage, we will present legislation to standardise eligible derivatives contracts, putting them through central counterparty clearing that is properly regulated and supervised."
"We are also now considering whether further specific measures are needed for sovereign derivatives markets."
"The crisis has also once again brought the role of credit rating agencies to the fore."
"These agencies play a pivotal role in the functioning of financial markets, but ratings appear to be too cyclical, too reliant on the general market mood rather than on fundamentals - regardless of whether market mood is too optimistic or too pessimistic."
"Because credit rating agencies have such a key role and influence over the markets, they also have a special responsibility to ensure their assessments are both sound and comprehensive."
"That is why in 2008 the Commission quickly put forward new legislation for these agencies, which will come into force in the next few months."
"These rules will ensure that credit rating agencies act more transparently, publish their methodologies and avoid conflicts of interest, but we need to go further."
"To strengthen the supervision of these actors of Europe-wide dimension, the Commission believes they should be put under the direct supervision of the future European Securities Markets Authority, and that is exactly what we will propose."
"We have also launched a reflection on whether further measures may be needed to ensure the appropriate rating of sovereign debt in particular."
"We must get our own house in order while pushing others to do the same."
"The Commission will do whatever is necessary to ensure that financial markets are not a playground for speculation."
"Free markets constitute the basis for the functioning of successful economies, but free markets need rules and compliance, and rules and compliance need to be tightened if irresponsible behaviour puts at risk what cannot and should not be at risk."
"Market behaviour must rest on sound and objective analysis, and financial services must realise that they are exactly that: a service, not an end in itself."
"They must not become detached from their economic and societal function."
"In fact, financial-market players are still in business because regulatory authorities and democratic institutions - ultimately the taxpayers - stabilised the markets in the financial crisis."
"We acted swiftly then, and precisely for that reason, we will also act swiftly in the future."
"So the message from this Friday's meeting of Eurogroup Heads of State and Government should be clear, and it will be clear: we will do what is needed - on all fronts."
"We would like to add our voice to the condolences which Mr Barroso has expressed in his speech."
"The events of which Mr Barroso was speaking took place today in Greece."
"We have high hopes that the impasse in Greece will be broken."
"The recent problems there arouse the concern and interest of all Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in Europe are going through a particularly difficult period with the serious crisis in Greece, its consequences for the citizens and, as you pointed out, tragic and dramatic consequences, with the debts that are piling up in most of our Member States, and with a European response that does not always live up to our hopes, but which at least exists."
"Reforms that will ensure that our Member States stop taking decisions on their own, without consulting their partners - with whom they do, after all, share a currency, values and, hence, a common destiny - about their budgetary priorities, their fiscal priorities and their social priorities. Reforms of people's mentalities, so that our parties, our ministers, our national colleagues stop systematically denigrating the decisions taken in Europe, when they themselves have been party to those decisions."
"Can we in fact continue any longer to call for solidarity from our partners when we face difficulties and totally ignore them when things return to normal?"
"Can we continue any longer to call for substantial aid from our partners without being able to guarantee absolute transparency in the presentation of public accounts?"
"Lastly, can we continue any longer to be surprised that questions keep being asked when we call for solidarity among peoples of whom some work 35 hours and retire before the age of 60, and others work 48 hours and retire at the age of 67?"
"I do not think so."
"On the contrary, I believe that the time has come to ask the real questions and to provide the real answers to those questions."
"These answers are not, for the most part, national, but European in the world in which we live."
"These answers are not about courting popular opinion, but about being responsible and sensible."
"These answers are our responsibility; we must provide them without hesitation, or else they will be imposed on us more quickly than we think."
"Not only will our peoples be able to accuse us - and rightly so - of having failed to do our duty, of having failed to tell them the truth, but they will also have to put up with decisions that are even more painful than the ones that have to be taken today."
"We must call very explicitly for an economic Europe, a social Europe and a fiscal Europe, something which requires very practical measures on the part of our governments, on both the right and the left."
"Will this argument be heard by the Council?"
"Will we be able to ensure that it is heard loud and clear?"
"I put the question to Mr Verhofstadt, who has some experience of this Council."
"Does he think it is possible to enter into discussions, together, within the Council?"
"Will this argument be taken up by the Commission?"
"I hope so, and I strongly urge you, Mr Barroso, to take it up: I ask you, as guardian of the Treaties, to ensure that the decisions that we take are well and truly applied by the Member States."
"I note, with regard to the Services Directive, for example, that this is far from being the case."
"This is a lost opportunity, in terms of growth, which we will no longer be able to allow."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not an idealist."
"I do not consider myself naive, but I do believe that the moment of truth has arrived for Europe, and I propose that we rise to these challenges with courage, with a sense of responsibility, just as Europe's founding fathers, those founding fathers of Europe who had no hesitation in taking courageous and visionary decisions - Schuman, De Gasperi, Adenauer and the others - did 60 years ago."
"We must follow their example: they did not wait; they did not hold a referendum."
"They seized their political courage with both hands to respond to the crucial issues that arose."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that we are going through may be a good thing if we have the courage to take the right measures, but it may be very serious if we avoid the necessary reforms."
"We urgently need economic and social governance; we urgently need an adaptation of the rules on taxation."
"Lastly, we need to guard against creating an artificial gap between the Member States of Europe and the others."
"European solidarity applies to every one of the 27 countries."
"I call on you, Members of the Council, to see Europe as it really is."
"I call on you to carry out studies on what will happen to us if, tomorrow, France and other countries encounter the same difficulties as Greece."
"What will become of our euro?"
"What will we be able to do for our European citizens?"
"Thank you for your attention."
"We share this responsibility jointly, and time will not stand still for us."
"I notice that one of our Members, Mr Madlener, has asked to speak under the blue card procedure."
"However, I already have you on the list of speakers."
"I have, here, Barry Madlener as a speaker."
"I will give you the floor in a few minutes."
"I promise you will be able to speak."
"Mr President, first of all allow me to express, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, our complete solidarity with the Greek people following the deaths that have taken place today."
"I would also like to call for a return to calm and say to the Greek people that we are on their side and that they have our support in the efforts that they are making in this long and difficult trial that they are facing."
"I would also especially like to address the Prime Minister, Georgios Papandreou, and encourage him in his firmness and political courage and in all the hard work he is doing to save the future of his country."
"In the months and years to come we hope that the European Union will do everything it can to support the reform processes that are necessary."
"We cannot continue to simply play a monitoring role."
"The European Union must play a part in the reform and support it."
"The success of the transformation process must be a joint success for everyone in a united Europe, invoking a common destiny."
"In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the European and fiscal instruments are adequately mobilised, providing all the help and assistance that we can during this difficult period."
"Moreover, beyond the Greek crisis, I think that we can conclude that the last few weeks have been very illuminating."
"We must use everything that we have learnt to strengthen economic governance and build a European Union that is not only monetary but also truly economic."
"Something that was inconceivable at the time of Jacques Delors has now become inevitable, and we must measure up to the demands of our times."
"In order to achieve all of these ambitious objectives, we must first learn to work together."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is one of the elements that has most demonstrated the need to coordinate our economic policies."
"The coordination of our economic policies must be active and effective, and focused on processes of sustainable, strong growth that is shared by all and will guarantee jobs."
"We hope that the European Commission will soon put forward brief proposals in this respect that go beyond just repressive logic."
"We must learn to build and grow strong together."
"President Barroso, I hope that you understand the urgent need to make maximum use of the role that the Commission can play in this phase."
"Secondly, we must equip ourselves with the mechanisms that we need to tackle a crisis."
"It is high time for the Council to approve the establishment of a European financial stability mechanism, a proposal that was adopted in March by the prime ministers and leaders of the Party of European Socialists."
"We must condemn the aggressive and speculative attitude of some financial agents, but we must also understand that we have designed a monetary system that is insufficient in times of crisis."
"Thirdly, we must develop a new concept of European solidarity."
"Either we move towards a common destiny, or we must resign ourselves to succumbing to the negative dynamic of national selfishness and destructive competition between ourselves."
"We cannot say that we want to live together while at the same time saying that in practice we each want to act independently."
"The current crisis is an acid test, and we must understand its full significance."
"Fourthly, we need to attach the necessary importance to the financial sphere."
"The coming weeks and months will be an opportunity for Parliament to take a position on a series of very important legislative proposals, such as hedge funds and financial supervision."
"I call on all the institutions to support us in this responsible approach, in order to guarantee that Europe quickly establishes a solid regulation and monitoring system."
"We hope that by working together we can also create a tax on financial transactions, so that the financial entities make a fair contribution to the economic effort that every one of us has had to make."
"The future of Greece will largely depend on the growth of its neighbours - us - as we are its main economic partners."
"If we are not capable of tackling the challenges that have already been set in the 2020 strategy, if we are not capable of fleshing out a common political agenda and if our economies are condemned to slow growth, with few employment opportunities, we will not be able to prevent further attacks that could be even more serious and difficult to manage."
"The future of our continent is at stake."
"The future of Europe depends on our intelligence, our solidarity and our firmness."
"Mr President, allow me to start by telling you that I hope, as I believe do all my fellow Members and the President of the Commission, that the system that we have put in place will work."
"I have had my doubts since the start and have criticised the system of bilateral loans, but that does not mean that I do not hope that it works and stops speculation against the euro."
"For, little by little - ladies and gentlemen - there has been speculation against the euro and an attack on the euro, and not only an attack on Greece or an attack linked to the state of the public finances in Greece."
"This is therefore far more serious and more widespread."
"I for my part hope that this system, once formalised on 7 May, will be able to fully achieve its objective, for the simple reason that we have no other instrument."
"We have no other instrument."
"Therefore, this system has to work, and it has to be supported."
"However, it is also important - and this is my second point - to clearly understand that, in the near future, it will not be possible to resort to it at every turn."
"A structural mechanism will have to be provided as soon as possible; perhaps not for the next few months but certainly for the next few years, because we are going to encounter such situations again."
"Moreover, if we want to have access to a structural mechanism for the future, we have to bear in mind one thing: lessons need to be learnt from what has taken place over the last five months."
"We needed five months to put a mechanism in place: three months to decide on its principle, then two months to decide on its conditions."
"Why?"
"Because this is an intergovernmental system!"
"Once again, I believe that the first lesson to be learnt for the future is that we must follow the Commission in its Community approach."
"For the Commission had proposed a European loan: it could have been approved immediately in December or January and could already be having an impact today and stopping this speculation against the euro."
"I therefore hope that, on 7 May, the first decision, the first lesson to be learnt from what has happened over the last five months will be that we say - in the hope that this works - that we are now going to ask the Commission to propose a European loan that can stop speculation against the euro immediately."
"For the European Union's entire credibility and liquidity rests on such a proposal, which is not the case in an intergovernmental system, where 16 countries must say 'yes', 16 parliaments, perhaps, must say 'yes', and so on."
"I also hope - although Mr Rehn has already begun to make proposals - that the second lesson that we learn from all this is that we need to introduce a number of structural reforms, namely a preventive chapter in the Stability and Growth Pact - which Mr Rehn has proposed - a European monetary fund, a structural mechanism that can be used straight away and, thirdly, a 2020 strategy that is far more robust than the strategy that is down on paper today."
"Then, we also need reform with regard to the rating agencies, even if the latter are like weather forecasts: either they are too flexible and we want them to be slightly more inflexible, or they are too inflexible and we want them to be slightly more flexible."
"However, a European-level initiative is definitely a good idea that must be looked into."
"Lastly - this is my last point, Mr President - I call on the Spanish Presidency to agree to financial supervision very quickly."
"I am sorry, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, but it is not us who are to blame, but the Council!"
"Am I not right in thinking that it was the Council that changed the Commission's proposals?"
"There were some Commission proposals that I even criticised, but they still went much further than those of the Council."
"We are the ones who are redoing the Commission's work for the moment, and I have a worthy proposal to put to you."
"If you want financial supervision and the proposals to be applied within a month, then approve straight away, with the Council and Ecofin, the amendments that Parliament is going to table to you in the next few days."
"It will take no time at all to approve them, and financial supervision will be applied."
"I hope that you will be able to relay this information to your Ecofin colleagues, who have merely outlined, in their proposal, a system for avoiding the financial supervision that was established by the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to continue somewhat along the lines of Mr Verhofstadt's speech."
"It is clear that we have been drifting for four months."
"It is clear that we have made mistakes."
"It is clear that, by drifting, we have given impetus to the markets and to speculation."
"Those Council Members who are responsible should at least admit it!"
"They should say: 'We are to blame!"
"It is us!"
"It is our fault!'"
"Mrs Merkel, Mr Sarkozy, I do not know what they are called or what they do in life, but everyone could read it in the newspapers: action needed to be taken straight away."
"That is my first point."
"Secondly, I would like one thing to be understood at least, and that is that the task facing the Papandreou government is nigh on impossible."
"I call on Ecofin, on the Heads of State or Government, to realise that their countries are incapable of implementing reforms."
"How much time does France need to reform pensions?"
"How much time does Germany need to build up pensions?"
"Now, Mr Papandreou is being asked to change everything in three months."
"You are completely crazy."
"The events currently taking place in Greece prove it."
"Greece - rather, Mr Papandreou - is not being given the time to achieve a consensus in Greece."
"No one identifies with the State in Greece."
"The policy is one of every man for himself, which is regrettable, and decades of political corruption in Greece are also responsible for this situation."
"What must be created, however, is cohesion."
"It must be created, it cannot be decreed!"
"You in Spain will see what happens if you have problems, and those in Portugal will see what happens if they have problems."
"Mr Barroso knows something about this, since he lost elections in this way."
"Therefore - no, he never lost an election - what I mean is that we must have a sense of responsibility and that we must not ask for the impossible."
"I have the impression that, at one time, people would say, people would hear: 'I want my money back'."
"Now, I have the impression that, at government level, it is a case of: 'I want to make money on the back of Greece'."
"For that is also the problem: by borrowing at 1.5% or 3% and lending to Greece at 3%, 5% or 6%, money is being made on the back of Greece."
"That is unacceptable!"
"Besides, Europe can take initiatives."
"Mr Verhofstadt is right when he talks about a European monetary fund, about an investment and solidarity fund in order to raise a European loan."
"The Treaties must be amended."
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House have the opportunity to take an initiative to amend the Treaties."
"Let us not wait for the Council; it is incapable of reaching a decision."
"Let us take the initiative, a common initiative by this House to amend the Treaties, so that, at last, there is a European monetary fund that can actually combat speculation."
"We can do it; yes, we can."
"Let us do it."
"Now, I would like to say something about the way in which the events in Greece are being managed."
"I call on the Commission to involve the Directorate-General for Employment in the management efforts so that we can also gauge what is happening in Greece."
"I call on the Council to tell the IMF to involve the International Labour Organisation in the management of the events in Greece, because these are human beings we are talking about."
"There are employment problems, there are employees."
"I believe that it should not just be finance, but also security and the ILO or the Directorate-General for Employment, that dictates."
"The latter would counteract the madness that sometimes characterises those who take decisions on the basis of purely financial considerations."
"I have one last point."
"There is a way of shoring up the Greek budget, and it is simple: the European Union should take an initiative aimed at disarmament in the region."
"In other words, a political initiative between Greece and Turkey aimed at disarmament."
"In other words, a political initiative to have the Russian troops ... the Greek troops ... the Turkish troops - excuse me - withdraw from Northern Cyprus."
"Let them disarm."
"I will say one thing: people are, nonetheless, hypocritical."
"In the last few months France has sold six frigates to Greece for EUR 2.5 billion, helicopters for more than EUR 400 million, and some Rafale jets (one Rafale jet costs EUR 100 million)."
"Unfortunately, however, my spying efforts do not allow me to say whether it was 10, 20 or 30 Rafale jets."
"That comes to almost EUR 3 billion."
"Then, there is Germany, which has sold six submarines to Greece in recent months for delivery over the next few years."
"They come to EUR 1 billion."
"Yet this is completely hypocritical."
"We are giving them money to buy our weapons."
"I call on the Commission to give an account here, in the European Parliament, and at the Council, of all the weapons sold by Europeans to Greece and Turkey over the last few years."
"Let there be some transparency at least."
"Let us know!"
"Well, I tell you that, if we are going to act responsibly, we must guarantee Greece its territorial integrity: Greece has 100 000 soldiers, more than 100 000!"
"Germany has 200 000."
"This is completely absurd: a country with 11 million inhabitants has 100 000 soldiers!"
"Let us put that to Greece."
"It may well be more effective than cutting the pay of someone who earns EUR 1 000."
"This is my request to the Commission: be a little fairer."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as a born anti-revolutionary I shall be speaking with rather less passion than Mr Cohn-Bendit, but I understand now why 1968 was a success for him;"
"I could only follow events on television as a child."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I share the concern of the European people about current developments."
"Savers and pensioners, for example, are asking themselves where this is heading."
"The question and the concern are both legitimate."
"A EUR 110 billion package is an enormous amount of money."
"We first talked about 35 billion, then 60 billion, and now 110 billion."
"This is a huge sum, and the austerity package in Greece is also huge; yet we must not forget that Greece has lived on credit for too long, with a retirement age of 53 years."
"Who would not want that?"
"The question is whether or not Greece will come out the other end."
"We are now seeing strikes, rebellion, rioting and so on. This makes the Greek problem a European problem, our problem."
"The problem in Athens, Mr Cohn-Bendit, affects the Dutch, Flemings, Germans - all of us - and the contamination risk remains."
"I take the view that Greece should have been thrown out of the euro area once the budget misappropriations were discovered."
"We should have set a cut-off point, but we failed to do so and now we have to continue and hope against hope for success."
"We must also rewrite the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is providing neither stability nor, at present, economic growth."
"In my opinion, supervision must be strengthened, the European Commission must show more courage and there must be greater monitoring of compliance with the rules."
"This has been absent in recent years."
"As I see it, however, we also need an exit procedure for countries that can no longer cope in the euro area."
"We have an exit procedure for the European Union but not for the euro area, and I believe we do need this option, so that a country may introduce and devalue its own currency to get itself back onto dry land."
"Why is there an exit procedure for the European Union itself, via the Treaty of Lisbon, but not for the euro area?"
"Commissioner Rehn told me last time that a country's departure from the euro area would run counter to the ever closer union, but Greece is currently demonstrating where the limits of this ever closer union lie."
"Suddenly we have a weak euro and a low growth rate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are held captive by the theory of the ever closer union."
"We are holding European taxpayers to ransom, and those taxpayers are becoming more uneasy with each passing day; this should not be forgotten."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must, of course, provide assistance to Greece."
"However, the so-called rescue operation also has some absurd elements."
"With France and Germany acting like great powers, the process of reaching a decision on the assistance package was very expensive and protracted."
"For years, the financial markets have been increasingly deregulated and now everyone is surprised that it is expensive."
"Who will now pay the price for the political errors?"
"The workers, ordinary citizens?"
"Banks are not being placed under any obligation."
"No, once again it is the taxpayers who are to pick up the tab and dig deep in their pockets to pay for the profiteering of the banks."
"Once again, dependent workers are to have to accept pay cuts."
"With the dictates from the International Monetary Fund, any semblance of a democratic decision-making process has been eliminated."
"In the case of the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico, application of the polluter-pays principle has been called for."
"I believe that is right."
"Anyone who digs for money or gold should also be responsible for the damage in cases of doubt."
"At the moment - at least in Germany - banks do not even have to pay back the debts that they have taken on and with which they are happily speculating against the euro - yes, against the euro."
"Furthermore, they are still speculating, even though we have been saying for a long time that something needs to be done about this."
"Proposals for what could be done are on the table."
"A ban on trading credit derivatives and on short selling, the introduction of a financial market transaction tax, special levies on bonuses in the financial sector, a legally binding bank and insurance levy - all of these proposals are on the table."
"Of course, Greece must also do its homework."
"Like other countries of the European Union, Greece should also tax wealth, combat corruption and reduce its arms expenditure."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has already spoken very convincingly about this."
"I will therefore omit the facts in this regard and endorse what he said in his speech."
"I can understand people in Athens going out into the streets and protesting."
"What I cannot understand is the violence."
"I agree with everyone who has expressed sympathy for the victims, whose suffering is most regrettable."
"Violence will achieve the opposite of what the protesters and honest demonstrators want."
"We must call for an end to the violence."
"Mr President, thank you very much."
"We are trying to make the numbers look good and it is a well-known fact that, when the numbers look good, the people are unhappy."
"We need to strike a balance; we need to balance the figures and we need to keep the people happy."
"As a result of this unorthodox behaviour, Greece is mourning three victims today, the death of three workers as a result of aggressive protests by other workers."
"Throughout Europe today, the economic crisis which came at us from the other side of the Atlantic and which is tending to be worse over here, is heaping scorn on politics and politicians."
"In Greece, the grassroot sections of society are very badly disposed towards politicians: there are 300 members of parliament in Greece and I hear the beat of Greek society drumming out 'hang all 300 of them'."
"These are dangerous times."
"I read about the same things and about the same scorn for politics in other Member States of the European Union; we all know about this, just as we all know that we need to maintain democracy."
"This being so and with these thoughts in mind, because I have no time to expand further, what I want to stress is that the leaders of tomorrow will need to move more quickly and in the direction of a more permanent solution for more states."
"Greece is one of them; it is the tip of the iceberg."
"However, there are other Member States - both inside and outside the euro area - facing economic problems which will worsen over coming months."
"Mr Salavrakos, I did not interrupt you because you are Greek and your words are very important to all of us."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to address in particular Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Daul and Mr Schulz - he is not here at the moment, but I address his group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament - as they were partly responsible for the problems."
"They say solidarity is needed."
"Let me remind you that Greece has been the largest net beneficiary of European funds for years."
"This has resulted in the country rigging the game, and you have been only too willing to be taken for a ride, as you are all so Europhile and crave European enlargement so much that you have ceased to be critical altogether, and now we are left holding the baby."
"I do not know if you remember that Spain - the country that is next in line - has legalised two million illegal immigrants in the last 15 years."
"You all thought that was great, but now Spain has 20% unemployment and it, too, is in deep trouble, as is Portugal."
"These are all countries with socialist governments that you have supported with European funds for years and which have made a mess of things by living beyond their means."
"Year after year you have looked on, year after year you have approved this, and now we, the citizens, are having to pay the price."
"You should be thoroughly ashamed."
"The only solution - which I have not heard anyone mentioning here - is that we now be tough on Greece."
"The country must reintroduce the drachma, as its membership of the euro area is untenable."
"If Spain is next, it simply reintroduces the peseta, and likewise Portugal the escudo, and then they will be able to compete again."
"This Europe is faulty, and northern European citizens will soon refuse to pay any more for your mistakes and for the lax socialist governments in these countries."
"After all, to reiterate, Greece, Spain and Portugal - all socialist countries - have all received European Union funds."
"Immigration has run riot whilst you have looked on and done nothing."
"(EL) Mr President, thank you."
"I should like to comment on something which Mr Salavrakos said earlier about the three people, the three workers, who were killed in Athens today by three other workers."
"There is absolutely no excuse for this."
"These people were killed by murderers, by criminals."
"Workers held a massive peace rally in Athens today."
"They did not kill anyone."
"The real criminals were condemned by the Prime Minister, Georgios Papandreou, and all the political parties in Parliament just a short while ago."
"It is a great mistake and it is dangerous to confuse peaceful protests and criminal acts such as those committed in Athens."
"They are condemned by everyone, they do not speak for Greek workers and they do not express everyone's conviction that, if we unite as a nation, we shall get the country out of the crisis."
"I would not like to get involved in a discussion about this."
"However, please allow me to say that all of us in this Chamber - all Members of the European Parliament, and I am sure this also includes the President of the Commission and Mr LÃ³pez Garrido on behalf of the Council - would like, once again, to express enormous solidarity with the Greek nation."
"They are our friends, and we know what great responsibility there is on both sides of the conflict which is taking place in Greece."
"It is a huge responsibility."
"I would like to tell you all that I, too, have experienced that responsibility, and that I have experienced it from both sides."
"I was a member of a trade union and an activist, and was very active for many years."
"I have also been the head of a government, and I understand the difficult situation which exists, today, in Greece."
"We all want to show solidarity and to express our deepest sympathies, above all to the families and friends of the victims."
"It is natural that we want to do this, and we consider it our duty in the European Parliament."
"Thank you for the responsible debate which we have had, today, in this Chamber."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We are experiencing a serious situation."
"There is an obvious lack of solidarity of the European Union's leaders - Germany's in particular - regarding the agreement on Greece's situation."
"Above all, they are taking political control of the country, whilst forcing the Greeks to regress decades in social terms."
"This calls into question all the principles that they have always proclaimed of social and economic cohesion, convergence, solidarity, and the so-called European social model."
"As is being well shown by the struggle of the workers and working classes in Greece, it is unacceptable to require the Greek Government to put their fundamental rights at risk."
"This is being imposed in exchange for a loan at a rate of interest higher than that of the International Monetary Fund itself."
"It seems there are no limits for the leaders of the euro area."
"They have gained from Greece's fragility, and now they are imposing their imperial position of absolute domination of the country's internal policies in exchange for a loan on which they will also gain from the interest."
"This decision must be changed at the next summit."
"The leaders must opt for a non-refundable grant from the Union's budget, either on an extraordinary basis, or financed by future Union budgets."
"The richer countries in the euro area must adopt the principle of economic and social cohesion once and for all."
"Europe 2020 - new European Strategy for Jobs and Growth (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statement on Europe 2020 - new European Strategy for Jobs and Growth."
"Madam President, I am delighted to be tackling a subject that is of the utmost importance to the Council and the Spanish Presidency, which is the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and quality employment."
"As has already been said, we are emerging from the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, and we must do everything we can to guarantee the recovery that we are beginning to see in the European Union, according to the forecasts presented by the Commission today, and at the same time, to mitigate the social consequences of the crisis."
"However, as well as this short-term work that is being done by the Member States and the European institutions, we need to look beyond this decade and ensure the sustainability of our social model, the European social model."
"This is the dual challenge contained in the Europe 2020 strategy."
"It is about not returning to a crisis that has not yet completely come to an end, and it is above all about doing so by establishing a strategy for growth, a model for growth that is adapted to the new times."
"It also needs to be a strategy for growth that is feasible and enforceable, and represents the European Union's major political and economic commitment for the next few years."
"As you are well aware, discussions on the Europe 2020 strategy began among the Heads of State or Government on an informal basis on 11 February."
"The strategy was then discussed in the European Council in March, and was also discussed in many of the formations of the Council being chaired by the Spanish Government during this six-month period."
"In March, the European Council gave the go-ahead to the launch of the Europe 2020 strategy, which will take place definitively at the European Council in June, and established the elements, the structure and even the road map for the future development of the strategy."
"The strategy is going to be focused on key issues for Europe: knowledge and innovation, the sustainable economy that the European Parliament was requesting, high employment, and social integration."
"Of these five key targets, those that have been quantified are employment: 75% for men and women, investing 3% of GDP in research and development and the '20/20/20 targets' for combating climate change."
"The target for decreasing the education drop-out rate and increasing the proportion of the population with higher education has not yet been quantified, nor has the target been set for promoting social integration, and in particular reducing poverty."
"All of this is on the basis of the communication adopted by the Commission, which was a determining factor in the subsequent decision and the conclusions adopted at the March European Council."
"Firstly, the structure of the Europe 2020 strategy has some integrated guidelines."
"The Commission has just put forward its proposal on the focus for these integrated guidelines - the Spanish Presidency has committed to working in all the Council's relevant areas of action so that the Economic and Financial Affairs Council and the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council can inform the European Council in June - and also the employment guidelines that require a European Parliament opinion."
"Secondly, we have the main targets, which I referred to before."
"Thirdly, there is something new in the new strategy: the national objectives."
"Every Member State must set its national targets, but they naturally need to be integrated into the European targets and supported by the Commission and the Council."
"Fourthly, there has also been talk of what are described as the 'bottlenecks' that shape growth at national level."
"There is also something new in relation to the Lisbon Strategy: the Spanish Presidency is going to focus above all on those that affect the internal market."
"Fifthly, there are the 'flagship initiatives' that are being developed by the Commission."
"We want the first of these to be realised during the Spanish Presidency: the Digital Agenda, which will be covered in the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council in May, after a communication that the Commission has undertaken to publish on 18 May."
"To conclude, Madam President, I would also like to say that there are going to be specific debates on the new strategy in some of the formations of the Council, and that, as far as possible, we want those debates to be public, for example the next one in the Education, Youth and Culture Council next week."
"I would like to emphasise that the work will of course not be finished in June."
"That is when the Europe 2020 strategy will be launched, but the work will not be finished then."
"It will have to be implemented and applied through the national reform programmes."
"Finally, I would like to say that, from the point of view of the 'governance' of the strategy, the European Council will play an important role. (It has played an important role from the start, and it is an idea that has repeatedly been supported by both the Spanish Presidency and the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, who has played a very special role.)"
"The European Council is going to play a very important role and undertake a very important task in developing and guiding this strategy, alongside the European Commission."
"They will be the two key institutions for implementing this strategy, which already has specific instruments that we all want to use."
"President of the Commission. - Madam President, Europe has been presented with a stark choice."
"We could take a beggar-thy-neighbour approach to the economic and financial crisis, a sauve qui peut attitude that would risk everything we have achieved over the last 60 years."
"Or we could increase European cooperation in an effective way, using all the tools at our disposal."
"Events over the last few months - continuing market volatility, the need for further financial market reforms and the need for a determined consolidation of public finances - have only increased the clarity of this choice."
"We need to stress the importance of the European dimension more than ever and we have an opportunity to do precisely that, with the objectives of Europe 2020."
"I have been invited to talk to you now about Europe 2020, but looking in isolation at this package of measures for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth does not really make sense, because one of the key conclusions we can draw from the crisis we are now living is that we have to work together, at all levels and in all areas, to fill the gaps in the framework for regulation and supervision of the financial markets, to restore macroeconomic stability and sound public finances, to launch the structural reforms that can steer Europe to a path of sustainable growth and jobs."
"All these three volets matter equally - we need to get it right in all three if we are to meet our objectives."
"So all this demands a holistic approach, financial markets reforms, reinforced economic governance, Europe 2020 for sustainable, inclusive, smart growth and leading global reforms through the G20, because many of these matters have external dimensions."
"We have to use all the levers at our disposal in an intelligent way, recognising that each one has an impact on all the others."
"Let me touch briefly on most of them."
"I will not come back to the financial issues I just mentioned in the previous statement but let me mention the G20 to start with."
"The G20 has been instrumental in addressing the financial economic crisis, improving governance on a more global level."
"The European Union can take a large share of the credit for giving the impetus to the G20 and feeding it with ideas."
"The Commission has made a particular contribution to this, ensuring that the interests of all 27 Member States are properly reflected in our work."
"We will work hard to ensure that the European Union maintains its leadership at the Toronto Summit in June and the Seoul Summit in November."
"A key objective will be to get a clear message from the G20 on an exit strategy to support recovery - one where all major economies play their part."
"We have to address globally some of the imbalances that were at the origin of this crisis."
"We should also ensure that the burden of rebalancing global growth is shared by all G20 members."
"Raising awareness of our strategy for Europe 2020 and enhanced economic coordination in the EU in general, and in the euro area in particular, will be important in this context."
"It is important that Europe presents a coordinated approach to the G20."
"Another objective will be driving on with financial market reform."
"We need to keep up pressure on our international partners to deliver the timely and consistent implementation of the existing G20 commitments with a level playing field."
"Over and above this, I believe the time is right for the G20 to send a strong signal on how the financial sector can contribute to the financing of bank repair."
"We should strive for a coordinated and strong approach."
"A global agreement on bank stability levies, linked to concrete resolution measures, would send a strong signal."
"As the IMF recently suggested, this could be complemented by a tax on financial activities or profits."
"It is going to be an extremely difficult debate."
"I have to tell you, from the preparatory work going on with our partners in the G20, there are many who oppose this idea; nevertheless, I think we should pursue it."
"The European Union message will certainly be strongest if we speak with one voice and if we can say that the European Union has already done its own homework."
"That is why, before Toronto, we should aim to have agreement on the key financial services regulation files that I mentioned earlier this afternoon."
"That will require flexibility and creative pragmatism from both this House and from the Council."
"This brings me to the core of Europe 2020 - now placed in its proper context as part of the holistic approach I talked about at the beginning."
"As you know, the main elements of the Europe 2020 strategy were adopted by Heads of State and Government in March."
"We have had several occasions to debate them in this House."
"Even before we made a proposal, the Commission consulted you about this."
"We now have to flesh out the strategy in detail; the urgent need for action is clear to all."
"More than ever, as was highlighted in some of the statements made in the previous debate, one of the conclusions of this financial crisis and the problems of the euro area is the need to go ahead with structural reform in a coordinated and determined manner."
"Better coordination of our economic policies is the centre-piece of Europe 2020."
"Even before this Greek crisis we were suggesting and proposing more coordination of economic policies."
"This is clearly necessary in order to avoid future crises."
"It is essential if we want to exit the crisis successfully, restore growth, translate that growth into more and better jobs, and ultimately ensure a sustainable and inclusive future for Europe."
"The five targets proposed by the Commission are now largely consensual; numerical rates have already been fixed concerning targets on employment, R&D and the fight against climate change."
"The numerical target for the education objective - reducing school drop-out rates and increasing the share of the population with a tertiary or equivalent education - will be agreed by the European Council in June 2010, taking into account the proposal of the Commission."
"I am also strongly committed to getting a numerical target on the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"We simply cannot accept the continuing scandal of 80 million people at risk of poverty in the European Union."
"Work is continuing in the Council on this issue, and I will do all I can to convince the Member States of the importance of this target, knowing that this House shares our determination."
"Europe 2020 must be a balanced programme."
"Of course, you cannot have social equity without a competitive market, but nor are we willing to accept a Europe of economic efficiency without fairness."
"The national targets will enable a better and more efficient monitoring of the progress of the Member States, to ensure that we achieve the objectives set at EU level."
"Member States are in the process of setting these national targets, in cooperation with the Commission."
"The targets, I hope, will be agreed at the June European Council, so that implementation can start immediately after."
"The Commission issued a proposal on the integrated guidelines last week."
"They reflect the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The number of guidelines is more limited than last time - now we have 10 as opposed to 24 - which will encourage ownership of the instrument by all the different actors."
"I think this is progress."
"The June European Council should give political endorsement to the principles behind these integrated guidelines, but, of course, they will only be adopted after we have discussed them with you - the European Parliament - which I hope can be as soon as possible."
"The Europe 2020 strategy is not just inspirational, a list of objectives, it is not just a vision - it is a reform programme."
"Action will be taken at European level, but equally important is the fact that reforms will have to be made in each of our 27 Member States, in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity."
"We will make clear what has to be done at European level and what has to be at national level."
"Implementation will be key, as was said by the distinguished representative of the Council, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, there is now a much stronger awareness at Member State level of the need for reinforcing European governance."
"I hope that the Member States have learned with some of the shortcomings of the Lisbon Strategy where, in fact, many, if not all, of the objectives were good and in the right direction but there was not, let us be frank, enough sense of ownership and not enough muscle in the implementation of the programmes."
"That is why we need to close this delivery gap that prevailed under the Lisbon Strategy."
"For that, you have a crucial role to play in ensuring the successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"You, the European Parliament - apart from your role as a co-legislator - can also very effectively mobilise citizens and also - why not? - the national parliaments."
"What is critically important is the kind of relations, if I may say this to you, that the European Parliament establishes with national parliaments."
"So that we are sure that these reforms are seen not only as the reforms 'they' make in Brussels, or sometimes in Strasbourg, but that we make at all levels in European society."
"The sense of urgency, the need for reforms must be shared by all key socioeconomic and political players; at all levels of government but also by social partners."
"I believe it is very important and I welcome all the announcements made by Prime Minister Zapatero regarding the need to involve these social partners."
"Then we must ensure stronger, joined-up governance by tying all our coordination instruments together: Europe 2020 and Stability and Growth Pact reporting and evaluation, carried out simultaneously, to bring the means and aims together; input from the European Systemic Risk Board to ensure overall financial stability; structural reforms; measures to increase competitiveness; macroeconomic developments - all coming together to get us out of the crisis and firmly on the road to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth."
"If we want to be serious about economic governance, that is the only way to do it."
"We cannot speak of serious economic governance at European level and separate the macroeconomics from the microeconomics, separate the internal from the external."
"So we need the Member States and the European institutions to look at these matters in a holistic approach and putting all those instruments together - that is the only way to instil some confidence as well in our strategy."
"I spoke of a stark choice at the beginning of this speech, and the Commission knows which paths it wants to take."
"I am confident this House shares that choice - a choice of determination, a choice for Europe - and I count on your input as we continue our work."
"Madam President, President Barroso, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, this debate on the EU 2020 strategy was rightly preceded by a debate on the crisis in the euro area, and the crucial issue in each debate is how to strengthen European governance."
"You talk of coordination of economic policy, but a major problem is that all of this has been interpreted too much as a free-for-all and Member States have taken no notice of the agreements."
"This really cannot continue."
"This goes for the Stability and Growth Pact, and is also the main lesson to be learnt from the Lisbon Strategy."
"Thus, things must be done differently with the EU 2020 strategy."
"Our group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), expects to see an ambitious commitment by the Commission to European economic governance before this 2020 strategy."
"In June, we expect the Council to take resolute decisions and also to commit itself to ambitious objectives for the Member States and to sound European governance."
"Parliament will challenge you to do so if need be."
"The budgetary plans for the coming year must be in line with this 2020 strategy, and on other points, too, this House will play its institutional role to the letter, in the interests of sustainable economic growth and of jobs for our citizens."
"Madam President, the turbulence in the euro area is further testimony to the importance of sound public finances in terms of the stability of the euro, of financial and economic stability and of preventing us passing burdens on to future generations, to our children."
"Reform of public finances is an important precondition for a successful EU 2020 strategy and for restoring our competitiveness, therefore."
"That is why it is so important for you to present proposals next week for strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, Commissioner Rehn."
"It is crucial to strengthen its preventive effect and to put sustainable public finances on a sounder footing in the Member States."
"Therefore, on behalf of our group, I would encourage you to shoulder the responsibility falling to you as the Commission and come forward with ambitious plans."
"You can count on our support."
"We, Parliament, must look at how - together with you - we can challenge the Council to actually agree to strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is to be welcomed that the Council has set up a task force."
"I do hope, however, that the Council will give its assent to the European Commission proposals by the end of the year."
"We must make full use of the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen European governance in the short term."
"There is no time to lose."
"Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the link between the two debates that we have just had is intellectually coherent."
"Does that link really mean anything in practice?"
"We have some doubts within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, because we do not see any coherence between the text as it has been presented to us by the Commission and a strategic partnership that you want to establish in July, without Parliament having had the opportunity to give an explicit opinion on the 'employment' guidelines."
"How can one think that we would commit ourselves for the next 10 years?"
"Firstly, without taking stock of how the Lisbon strategy has turned out, you tell us, 'Everything has changed: we no longer have 27 guidelines; we now have 10!'"
"Is that change, though, Mr Barroso?"
"Coherence is about thinking that, if we want to make a success of the 2020 strategy, we have to start from where we are before we look at where we are going."
"We also have to look at where we want to go."
"The fact is, where we are today is in the worst crisis that the European Union as a whole has known since its inception; there have been none more serious than this."
"We cannot ignore it."
"We cannot embark on a strategy to come out of the crisis, since that would mean asking the public authorities to shirk their economic responsibilities in order to give free rein to the market."
"We cannot consider that strategy without using the tools at our disposal."
"As you well know, Mr Barroso, we are not as rich as all that."
"We have a tool, which is called the Stability and Growth Pact; we have another tool, which is called the financial perspective."
"If they are not clearly linked, we will go nowhere."
"Further, when we look at the point of departure, we have some concerns."
"Firstly, we in the S&D Group demand, as a matter of urgency, that the Member States no longer be subject to speculation on the markets."
"This is not about Greece, or about any other Member State."
"This is about a domino effect and about the lack of restrictions on speculation."
"That is why we are proposing the introduction of a financial stability mechanism by which to protect the Member States from such speculation, so that they can do what they have to do, which is to get back on the road to recovery and thereby safeguard the social model."
"For everyone knows, everyone has said during this crisis that our social model is our greatest asset where globalisation is concerned."
"If your 2020 strategy results in budgetary consolidation that totally destroys this social model, Europe will be the loser in international competition in the future."
"Therefore, it will lose its ability to strongly assert this model that we embody, and we will have surrendered our place to other continents, unless we surrender it to market forces alone."
"This is not our vision of the future."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, we have known for many months that Greece is in a very difficult position."
"We know that the euro is depreciating at a rapid rate before our eyes and that government bond spreads are rising."
"No one can still doubt that Europe is in a serious crisis, just when we thought we were back on our feet again."
"We seriously need to address the issues of competitiveness, of productivity and of sustainable economic growth, but still the leaders of Europe are bickering about what action to take."
"This is not the time."
"We need real action, and we need it now."
"Since it is apparent that peer pressure in the Council does not work, we need binding targets and new transparent means to scrutinise the reports about each Member State."
"We need a fundamental respect for the Stability and Growth Pact and we need reliable and true figures on which we can base our decisions."
"To put additional pressure on governments, structural funds and other European support must be tied to governments' ability to provide us with correct figures."
"Let me make a comparison."
"When a small farmer makes mistakes on half a hectare he or she loses out on the support for everything he or she does for a number of years."
"That is the comparison we have to make."
"That is why we are so tough on governance in parliamentary resolutions."
"It is also most embarrassing that the Commission is not putting forward proposals which we have been discussing for years."
"To create a platform for future growth, the strategic policy agenda must be included in the EU 2020 strategy."
"Let me take some examples."
"We negotiated the economic recovery plan."
"Most of it is not enforced."
"Parliament asked to have a plan B, so it is included in the results, but the plan B is not yet set into action."
"We have decided on a set plan, new energy technology."
"We still do not have 50% of the funding for the set plan, a real strategic tool."
"The most cost-effective means to reduce greenhouse gases is to move forward with a strategy for energy efficiency."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to put energy efficiency at the top of the agenda in action."
"The existing legislation must be stepped up because it is not sufficient."
"We need the promised Energy Efficiency Action Plan, promised for so long."
"We need energy in infrastructure, the energy equivalent of fast trains, super grids and high-tech smart grids are needed, and we have the money for this."
"We need to ensure technical innovation and we also need to encourage and put forward a strategy to combat social exclusion and gender inclusion."
"In the light of the current crisis, the Commission must step up to its responsibility and finish what we started together."
"The Council has to be bolder and stop bickering."
"We will put forward a bold resolution on the second step of the 2020 strategy."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it rather borders on political provocation when this Europe 2020 programme is presented as a great strategy for getting us further out of the crisis."
"We only need to look at the previous policy for regulating the financial markets in order to see - if we are reasonably honest - that for months - years in fact - we have been promising to regulate these markets that have run wild, but so far have only managed to make a tiny bit of progress."
"As regards Greece, we are now being forced to take a look in the mirror."
"From the crisis in Greece we can see that what has happened up to now is totally inadequate."
"Our citizens have heard us declare that we are rescuing the banks."
"They have gritted their teeth and accepted it."
"Now they are paying the price."
"Public finances are already overburdened by these measures."
"Now we are rescuing Greece, and we need to do it, there is absolutely no doubt about that."
"It will be yet another challenge for the public finances in many countries of the European Union."
"The banks are in the black and yet are applauded when it emerges that they are voluntarily contributing a bit to Greece."
"Mr Barroso, in the European Union, a market to which 27 States belong, we have no alternative but to actually come up with a financial transaction tax or other instrument that will reduce the hunger of speculators to make profits in this area."
"We really do need an instrument with which, in a genuinely fair way, we can make those who are profiting from this crisis and speculating against the euro contribute to what we now need to finance."
"In respect of public finances, we cannot carry on the way we have started."
"In the paper that you presented, I still cannot see a vision of what is to happen now."
"The reference to the fact that this needs to be regulated at a global level is familiar from the climate debate."
"In that regard, we have not made any progress for many years."
"For me, climate is the second major issue."
"We are by no means out of that crisis either, but are sinking deeper in, because we have not succeeded in taking appropriate measures."
"I actually find it deplorable that today, shortly before this debate, it became clear that Connie Hedegaard is working as hard as possible in the Commission to try to get the minimum target for the European Union implemented."
"If we look at the current situation, it is high time we raised our targets to 30%."
"If we do not raise this target, then we can forget our famous European emissions trading, for example."
"If CO2 has no appropriate price because our targets are too weak, then we have had heated debates for years but are still a long way from achieving the target we set ourselves."
"With regard to the transformation of the European economy to make it more sustainable - as indicated in the headings of the Commission's programme - all of us would say that we want to be involved in that."
"However, Mr Barroso, with regard to this programme, your Commission has still not said how the targets are to be achieved in the European economy."
"What instruments and what incentive programmes are to be used to do this?"
"Mrs Ek mentioned some specific areas."
"There is a great deal of work to be done on this programme."
"On the basis of what we currently have in our hand, the European Parliament cannot yet, in my view, say that after Lisbon this is now a successful strategy."
"This Europe 2020 has, so to speak, been formulated in such a way as to take us from the failure of the Lisbon Strategy into the next failure."
"Madam President, I think Mr Barroso really does have, today, a most difficult role."
"It is one of the most difficult jobs in the European Union that he has to do."
"He has to divide his time between reasoning with the Left and with the Right - with people who have the best answers to the most difficult problems."
"Mr Barroso has to manoeuvre artfully between these propositions."
"I think the best of these is the 2020 Strategy, which has been proposed by the Commission."
"I am surprised by the proposals which have been made in this Chamber, according to which the way to repair the present, very difficult, situation is to repeat our mistakes."
"I would like to say that I spent 18 years of my life in a country which was called the People's Republic of Poland, in which there was a Ministry of Internal Trade and where the shelves in the shops were empty."
"There was a Ministry of Internal Trade, but there was no internal trade."
"Today, and for 20 years now, for which I praise God, we do not have a Ministry of Internal Trade in Poland and we do have internal trade."
"I would like to say that the remedy for the current crisis certainly is not greater regulation, nor is it higher taxes or more intervention."
"I am not, of course, a free-market fanatic."
"I think the role of the state is to correct market mechanisms, but this should be done very carefully."
"If we want to talk honestly about development in Europe, let us remember how we voted on the Services Directive in the last parliamentary term."
"Let us remember what happened to the Services Directive in this Chamber."
"For without the free flow of persons, services and capital, Europe will not be able to compete effectively with the world's other continents."
"We are hearing here, today, that we cannot compete with other regions of political and economic integration, but surely it is we ourselves who are forcing our continent's entrepreneurs to go elsewhere by excessive regulation and placing excessive burdens on businesses."
"Let us, therefore, ask ourselves what more we could do to support the 2020 strategy, because there is no other, and of course we do have to get out of the crisis."
"There is also no doubt that we must help Greece."
"For us Poles, whom I represent here, the word 'solidarity' has great significance."
"We must, therefore, show our solidarity with Greece today."
"I want to emphasise yet again that we must do everything possible for Europe to recover from the economic crisis, because it is not only a problem faced by millions of families, but it is also a problem of faith in our future."
"I have faith in the future of Europe, I believe in our success."
"Madam President, if I compare the debate on the last agenda item with the current debate, then we are clearly talking about two parallel worlds."
"On the one side we have a European Union in which States like Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal find themselves in a deep crisis and other States like Germany and France are taking blocking action, while on the other side we have a European Union for which a strategy has been developed that does not in any way meet these challenges."
"With this strategy, we have neither defined a new direction for the development of the European Union nor have we provided answers to the questions relating to instruments that do not work."
"Similarly, we have not made any attempt to clarify the distribution of competences between Member States and the European Union or the relationship between the euro area and the countries in the European Union that are not part of the euro area."
"We have not included any of the issues that came up over the last few years in connection with the Lisbon Strategy and we have not given any forward-looking answers."
"We have provided no clarification with regard to the future development of the European Union."
"This has, of course, given rise to much of the discord that we can now sense."
"With regard to the discussion on European economic governance and the European monetary fund, too, we cannot simply act as if it is possible to continue with this strategy in this way."
"Before we talk about the implementation of Europe 2020, we urgently need to put the strategy on hold and give ourselves more time for the decision-making process and we need to carry out an analysis of the actual challenges we face."
"In so doing, we need to involve civil society and, above all, Parliament to a significantly greater extent than has been the case in the past."
"Otherwise, we will be heading for disaster with our eyes wide open!"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, it is a shame that Mr Barroso has fled the Chamber."
"I feel he would have learned so much from me this evening!"
"I would counsel you all not to worry too much about the EU in 2020 because I rather fancy it will not be here!"
"It will go the same way as the Soviet Union which it so resembles, and for the same reasons: it is centralised; it is corrupt; it is undemocratic and it is incompetent; it is driven by an unholy alliance of big business and fat-cat bureaucrats; it is sponsored by an ecofascist agenda from a platform of perverted junk science referred to as 'climate change'."
"Whenever the people of Europe get the chance of a referendum, they reject it."
"The British, of course, have not been given the chance to have their say, thanks to the deceit of the only three parties with access to television debate in my country, aided and abetted by an EU-corrupted public-service broadcaster known as the BBC."
"The EU is already crumbling."
"The scenes in Greece today will spread through the other Mediterranean countries sooner than we can imagine, and they will eventually reach northern European countries, which are being left to pick up the tab."
"Our children and our grandchildren will curse us as they are left to pick up the pieces of this wholly avoidable shambles!"
"(DE) Madam President, smart, sustainable growth, actionism, reforms, economic governance - many fine words and lofty goals."
"However, I have a couple of questions in this regard that give me cause for concern."
"Will the proclaimed new strategy suffer a similar fate to its predecessor?"
"How can we involve the regions and local authorities so that this strategy will actually succeed and, in particular, how can we better encourage and monitor the reorganisation of national budgets?"
"However, with our model solutions we must be very careful to ensure that a centralistic form of European economic governance does not slip in through the back door and erode the last remnants of national sovereignty."
"Sovereignty also means taking responsibility, and consequently taking responsibility for the wrong finance policy."
"It is unacceptable for some Member States to live beyond their means at the cost of the other Member States."
"We must show solidarity, of course, but it must not be a one-way street."
"Centralistic economic governance from Brussels dictating the European standard would surely be the wrong way to go."
"Madam President, I think it is important that we talk about good governance in the sense that it is, of course, important that we put pressure on all of us to bring in the reforms that are needed, but let us not forget that the main good governance we have in our own hands is to ensure that the European Union does what the European Union should do."
"We have had some shortcomings there; how we have upheld the stability and growth pact is one of those."
"Let us not forget that before we construct new rules we need to stick to the most fundamental rules, but let me also point to some other things."
"Regarding financial markets; let us talk about financial markets as a part of the economy, not as a separate sector, because we will never get investments and new jobs if we think this is a separate issue."
"I was a little bit disturbed when I noted that the Chair of the Basel II Committee assumed that the new rule for capital requirement will lower economic growth by 1%."
"That is a rather low level from him."
"Increasing the capital requirement might lead to less investment and that is really not what we need to do when we want to create a new confidence in the European economy at the same time as we are exiting from the budget deficits we have."
"Let me point to one of the things we can do together, and that is to create the knowledge economy."
"It is a paradox that the more our societies and economies are turning into knowledge economies, the less of an internal market we have because the internal market was legislated for industry and the old-time economy, and less for the service sector, where we need to go further regarding the service directive."
"Let me also say we should be implementing a reform making European universities more independent and more European, open for students and researchers and creating a dynamic development in the knowledge society."
"Let us stick to all the things we can do together at European level."
"That is the best European good governance we can have."
"(SV) Madam President, I come from the same Member State as the previous speaker, but I stand on the political left."
"This is also evident in the proposals that we Social Democrats are responsible for."
"We see the situation in the world."
"We see the situation in Greece: fighting in the streets, an impending general strike, desperation, anger, anger about the market games with all countries."
"This has, of course, also been exacerbated by the core euro area countries having failed their fellow Member State, Greece."
"However, crises can spread."
"It is a dangerous time for all countries."
"Few countries can count on remaining safe."
"For this reason, we all need to focus on overcoming the crisis and coming up with good proposals."
"However, we need to choose a way that does not merely involve the attainment of short-term solutions and short-term successes and putting out a fire which then flares up again and burns down a considerable amount around it."
"Firstly, then, we need to invest in something that will keep demand high."
"What concerns me ahead of the summit in June is that we are choosing the way that the previous speaker talked about."
"It is important for the summit to make clear commitments not to put Europe into low-energy mode."
"It is important to keep demand high and to stimulate investment."
"We need to get the unemployment rate down for women, men, young people and older people."
"Personally, I am very disappointed with the equality sham that the last Council presented after its meeting."
"Secondly, we need to start changing into climate-smart societies."
"Clearly, in every crisis there is also an opportunity for development: to change paths, to make a switch."
"It is incredibly important for the Commission to give Mrs Hedegaard room to actually be a climate politician who can help to make a difference in Europe at the meeting in CancÃºn."
"My third point relates to the financial markets."
"A few weeks ago in the Special Committee on the Financial, Economic and Social Crisis we had a visit from an American professor, who put it like this: in the United States we say that we cannot regulate the financial market because they are not doing so in Europe."
"We need to, but we do not have the courage."
"What do you say in Europe then?"
"Well, you say that you cannot regulate the financial market because they are not doing so in the United States."
"That is how we go on, throwing the ball into each other's courts in that way."
"There are winners in this kind of policy, but there are also many losers."
"That is something we need to have the courage to change in this Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from my economic experience I know that strategies are only as good as their specific implementation measures and the means of monitoring them."
"The Commission is yet to provide an answer in this regard."
"We listen to the goals, with which we can thoroughly identify, we hear the lofty intentions, but we hear next to nothing about how these goals are to be achieved in concrete terms."
"I had actually assumed that the financial and economic crisis - the largest we have experienced since the Second World War and which has now deepened on account of the additional problem of the national debt crisis - would have been at the top of the Commission's list of considerations."
"In my opinion, that should have been the logical starting point, as both crises have changed the situation significantly."
"If we do not just stop at lofty intentions but actually want to achieve something in the next ten years then we will have to address a number of points in very concrete terms:"
"Firstly, we need to review our finances - not only in the EU, but in each Member State, according to uniform criteria - so that we know where we really stand, what our financial leeway is and what we can actually afford to do."
"Secondly, we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets."
"Thirdly, we need to complete the internal market in areas where it is not yet complete - I am expecting a great deal from Mr Monti's report - including for services."
"Fourthly, we need to convincingly set out how we are to supplement the common monetary policy with a common, closely interlinked economic and finance policy and even a fiscal policy."
"Fifthly, we need to set out very specifically how we can replace the divergence that we have observed between the Member States with increasing convergence by concentrating on economic projects that are truly European in nature."
"There are very many of these: energy policy, energy interconnections, high-speed rail and road networks, navigation systems and many similar projects."
"(DA) Mr President, I should like to start by saying that the work on this EU 2020 strategy is very important, because we need to give some serious consideration to how we shall support ourselves in Europe in future."
"We need to give serious consideration to what the 23 million unemployed European citizens will do in future."
"Overall, however, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance feel the strategy lacks any specific objectives in a number of important areas that are intended to make the project of a social Europe into a top priority over the next 10 years."
"Firstly, we cannot see any clear target for reducing youth unemployment, which is alarmingly high in all Member States."
"The first steps here could be to introduce a European youth guarantee, which would give young people a foothold in the labour market."
"Secondly, we should ensure that we have specific targets for combating poverty."
"I think it is a disgrace if Europe's Member States in the world's richest region cannot agree on specific targets for reducing poverty."
"Some people say that they do not like the definition."
"To these people I would say that they should not let technicalities stand in the way."
"Others are saying that we do not have a legal basis in the Treaties."
"To these people I would say that we have the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"Thirdly, we must work in a consistent manner on a binding employment plan."
"We need to link green investments to new jobs."
"We need to re-educate and train our workforce to be able to take up these jobs."
"Last of all, the EU's Heads of State or Government must ensure that there is a distinct objective to develop a social Europe, where the same level of ambition is applied to employment and social security and where the focus is not only on the quantity, but also on the quality of the jobs that are created."
"EU 2020 does not yet deliver on these parameters, so we still have work to do."
"Mr President, I want to talk about a lack of ambition that I see in this EU 2020 strategy, for the way in which we can use the instruments which we have now - the single market - to get it to work very effectively and create those new jobs and opportunities: the sort of thing that Mrs Turunen was talking about."
"It is not good enough - and I say this to President and Council, if the Commissioner is listening - to put the single market and its achievement under this heading: 'Missing links and bottlenecks'."
"It is far more important than that, colleagues."
"And it is simply not good enough to say that the Commission will propose action; it is a shared venture between Commission and Member States."
"My committee, the Internal Market Committee, passed a report this week with a huge majority which sets out some really ambitious ideas for joint action to complete the single market."
"You will receive that next week in conjunction with Professor Monti's report."
"Let us see some fundamental changes in here, both parties."
"What we want is a single market act, a set of clear political objectives to complete the single market, and we also want to see public procurement, a massively underused tool to achieve those objectives of innovation and green technology."
"It is hardly mentioned in this document."
"For heaven's sake why are we talking about these other targets when we are not actually moving on what we have already?"
"(PT) Mr President, this strategy provides no response to the serious problems that we are facing, and even less to the true economic and social disaster that the imposition of free competition policies is bringing about in some Member States with more fragile economies."
"It is a mistake to insist on policies that are identical to the liberal Lisbon Strategy, which left the objectives announced 10 years ago of full employment and poverty eradication by the wayside, and instead gave priority to the interests of economic and financial groups, which was to their gain but came at the cost of worsening the social and employment situation."
"All you have to do is look at the consequences of applying the blind criteria of the Stability Pact, and of the liberalisations and privatisations of strategic public-service sectors, including financial services, energy, transport and postal services."
"All you have to do is look at what is happening in the field of labour, with decreased job security and increased unemployment, which is currently in excess of 23 million, to which 85 million people in poverty can be added."
"In contrast to what they try to make us believe, all indicators show that, if the strategies followed up to now continue, rates of economic growth will be very low and lower than in other parts of the world, meaning that unemployment will get worse, jobs will get less secure and less well paid, and poverty and social exclusion will get worse."
"Regrettably, the Union budget provides no response to the need for economic and social cohesion, as demonstrated by Greece's situation."
"It is, therefore, time to evaluate and admit the consequences of the policies that have been followed."
"It is time to prioritise social sustainability."
"It is time to put a stop to financial speculation and the domination of the economy by finance."
"It is time to bring an end to the Stability Pact and give the European Central Bank other functions, impose effective controls on the financial sector, and prioritise a true pact for progress and social development."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that we are here discussing and examining the content of this Europe 2020 strategy, while in Athens workers are dying, and a country, a nation is on the edge of a precipice, paints a rather telling, or, I would go so far as to say, grotesque, picture of European politics."
"It is absolutely remarkable that in a situation of this kind, the Commission does not feel that it should take a good, long look at itself, because it is not as though it does not realise that this crisis, which in some respects has now reached, I would say, dramatic proportions, is a consequence of many serious mistakes, as demonstrated by the failure of the Lisbon strategy."
"Many mistakes and one defendant in the dock: the euro."
"You come here saying, in all your statements, that Greece is a one-off, but will you be saying that when - although let us hope not - another similar situation arises, for example in Spain: will that be another one-off?"
"We here are a bit tired of hearing the one-off excuse: the subprime crisis was also a one-off."
"It is hard to believe and very difficult to accept what the Commission is saying when the European Union has not yet decided to clean up Europe's banks and to tell savers, manufacturers and the real economy how much muck there still is in European banks, in order to develop a strategy."
"We must keep these points in mind and remember that a serious strategy must be based on the real economy, on the small and medium-sized enterprise system, and naturally it must give a responsible role to workers, through their participation, too."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest problem in the EU is, without doubt, unemployment."
"However, we cannot blame workers, smallholders or entrepreneurs for this situation."
"The only culprit is that political and economic philosophy which has sided with multinational companies against workers, smallholders and small local entrepreneurs."
"The rootless, exclusively profit-oriented multinationals want to grab the lion's share of the profits while contributing as little as possible to public costs."
"Any strategic decision that favours local interests is good for Member States of the European Union, and any decision that upholds the hegemony of multinationals is bad."
"Jobbik would like to put an end to the economic monopoly of the multinationals and return Europe to the smallholders and family businesses, so that with their help we may eliminate unemployment within the European Community."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council and President of the Commission, the President of the Commission has just said that in times such as these we cannot take a beggar-thy-neighbour approach, but first need good cooperation and decisive action."
"That is true."
"We therefore also need a strategy for action."
"However, my impression is that this 2020 project, and in particular the way in which we are to negotiate and finalise it here, does not involve any genuine strategy."
"It is more like a reflection put to paper that is now being steamrollered through in a fast-tracked procedure."
"Whether this is the way to avoid the problems that Mr Barroso has quite rightly described is doubtful."
"For example, he said that the biggest problem with the Lisbon Strategy was the fact that the parties affected were not involved, that there was no ownership of it and that they therefore did not get involved in its implementation."
"That is precisely what happened."
"However, if that is the case, then for a new strategy we need to take the time to calmly work at getting the parties concerned genuinely involved and then be able to discuss it calmly. I understand that, at this time when the financial crisis and the problem of Greece are presenting us with new problems every day, we cannot handle it in this way."
"That is not a criticism, either."
"The criticism that I have is that we in Parliament allow the way in which we deal with the programme to be dictated to us."
"At the Conference of Committee Chairs, we have several times expressed the desire to structure the timeline a bit more carefully so as to be able to proceed more thoroughly."
"Instead of this, the procedure is being expedited and today we are holding a debate and we will have another one at the May part-session, then in June the proposal will go to the Council and that will be that."
"Please do not be surprised if at the end of all this there is no discernable change with regard to the action taken."
"This would not surprise me, because we cannot achieve a change in this way."
"We need a thorough analysis and not the sort of superficial conclusions that the Commissioner for Climate Action has drawn in recent days - which are deduced from the crisis situation and the fact that less CO2 is emitted now - to the effect that we can now aim for 30% or 40%."
"The standard cannot be the crisis!"
"The standard must be a forward-looking perspective."
"We need to take a careful look at the situation and give thorough consideration to what conclusions we can draw from innovations, economic development, innovation and research."
"However, we will not actually do it, of course."
"(ES) Thank you Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, thank you to someone who can pass the message on to the President of the College of Commissioners."
"I hope that your words will be followed up with actions and that in June we will see a very different Council from the one that we saw in the spring."
"This is because your words, which I support from beginning to end, do not reassure me or take away my fears of seeing a Council that is full of apathy, full of doubts, which sometimes even raises questions that really fill us with dread, for example that the targets, our big political, calculated targets, are not advisable and are not even possible."
"Thank you, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, I hope the Spanish Presidency will help to resolve all of these uncertainties, because I am convinced that these will be seen as momentous times in Europe's history when the time comes."
"They are very confused times, in which the major challenges are being put on the table as to whether we want more Europe or less Europe."
"This is the aim of the Europe 2020 strategy."
"In 10 years' time will we be more or less united?"
"Will the victory have been won by those who believe that we must work together to resolve economic and social problems or by those who go back to being satisfied with nationalism and destroying even the fundamental elements that have been built over the last 40 years?"
"Will we be more supportive?"
"Will we be prepared to adopt targets of solidarity with each other, to share more equally, to build more wealth and share it more equally, or will we leave it all in the hands of the markets?"
"I do not, as some of my colleagues have said, believe that this has happened because there has been a lot of Europe, a lot of regulation or a lot of social justice."
"On the contrary, it is the lack of Europe, the lack of regulation that has brought the crisis on."
"I would therefore like to make two requests, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido: keep the targets of fighting poverty and the targets promoting better education, which are in the Commission's text but not in the Council's text, and associate Parliament with the voice of the people, so that the people's agenda can be Europe's agenda, rather than it being the agenda of technocrats or of the so-called 'markets', which is often the agenda of speculators."
"(SV) Mr President, what affects Greece affects us all, including those countries outside the euro area."
"What Europe needs today is to be united and to take forceful action, not further division."
"Therefore, Commissioner, it is most disappointing that 11 countries will not be present on Friday."
"It has been said that we have a common destiny in Europe, but unfortunately that is not the case right now."
"Of course supervision of the financial markets needs to be increased and of course we need tougher legislation."
"That is something that, as a Liberal, I, too, can understand and accept, but it must be done in a balanced way and be coordinated at a global level."
"Let us take forceful and aggressive action, if that should be necessary, but we must not act out of panic."
"We need to keep as cool a head as possible so that we do not do further damage to the economic recovery that, in spite of everything and in spite of the situation in Greece, is discernable."
"When I heard Mr Bloom, I was really upset."
"He is not here now, but comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union is an insult to all those who suffered under Soviet tyranny and all those millions who died."
"I think Mr Bloom should apologise to all those people that he has insulted."
"Mr President, when the Spanish Prime Minister, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, inaugurated the Spanish Presidency in Strasbourg, he made a speech about Europe 2020 without once mentioning why on earth the Lisbon strategy failed in the first place."
"I then asked him the question: how can one possibly come up with a new strategy without analysing the failure of a previous one?"
"Now, I have no choice but to repeat my question, because the new document does not say a word as to why this failure happened."
"Please, SeÃ±or Garrido, can you answer my question: how is it possible to establish a new, very ambitious set of goals without first analysing the reasons for the failure of the Lisbon Strategy?"
"(NL) Mr President, I challenge the Commission and the Council to make clear choices."
"First of all: choose democracy."
"How does the Council intend to make decisions which will lay down socio-economic policies in Member States for a period of ten years without the voters being able to express their opinions on them during that period, during those ten years?"
"For example, that would mean that an outgoing Dutch Prime Minister would be able to make decisions for ten years, and that is just not acceptable."
"Secondly: work has to be paid work."
"The objective of 75% employment sounds fine, but Europe does not need any more poor workers."
"How does the Council actually define employment?"
"Thirdly: choose sound public spending."
"How can the Commission present a budget for 2011 promising growth of no less than 5.8%, while Europe 2020 places strong emphasis on austerity measures."
"Fourthly: choose a social internal market."
"Do the Commission and the Council agree with the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection which has proposed that the internal market have a more social ethos and that tender procedures focus more on quality and social justice?"
"Fifthly: choose poverty reduction."
"As far as poverty reduction is concerned, the Council is aiming only at economic growth."
"In recent years, economic growth has mainly led to managers being paid top salaries, but the poor are getting ever poorer."
"What action will you take to ensure that top earners and banks, and not the poor, foot the bill for the crisis, for example?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to tackle the employment problem constructively, there must be three watchwords for EU action: react, evolve, safeguard."
"React: namely, leave behind the celebratory tones of euro-propaganda in order to take practical action on the problems besetting EU citizens, ensuring a direct link between training and market and territorial requirements, and changing young people's perception of manual professions."
"Evolve: namely, make the Europe 2020 strategy a positive synthesis of the demands of businesses and those of workers, in support of a labour market where it is the flexicurity of employment contracts that responds to the instability of market demand."
"Safeguard: namely, give work to those who have lost it, first and foremost to our citizens: the Member States must therefore determine immigration policies in accordance with actual immigration requirements, and with 23 million unemployed they should consider blocking, for a few years, immigration from outside the EU."
"I see no other way to protect our jobs, our social system."
"What we need is pragmatism, courage and decentralisation."
"(RO) Sustainable economic growth requires huge, steady investment in the transport sector as well."
"The transport sector accounts for 10% of the European Union's GDP and provides more than 10 million jobs."
"I take this opportunity to call on the European Commission and the Council, when finalising the EU 2020 strategy, to take into account as well the following extremely relevant factors relating to the transport sector: promotion of research, development and innovation in order to achieve green transport; consolidation of the EU objective on the decarbonisation of transport through the use of alternative resources, electric cars, ITS, intelligent traffic management, covering the aviation sector as well; improvement of coordination among infrastructures in order to enhance environmental protection, workers' social conditions and passenger safety and security."
"I would like to highlight the following absolutely essential aspects in specific areas: the urgent need to implement the single European sky in the aviation sector, the urgent need to implement interoperability in the railway sector, expanding and improving road infrastructures and safety on European roads in the road transport sector, achieving comodality in inland ports and expanding the 'motorways of the sea' for sea and river transport, and the urgent need for the sustainable development of urban mobility."
"The European Commission must take into account all these aspects relating to mobility, which must be one of the key elements in the EU 2020 strategy."
"The well-coordinated development of the transport sector is crucial to sustainable development and to retaining and creating stable jobs."
"(EL) Mr President, thank you very much."
"Allow me to start, as a Greek, by expressing my deep regret at the tragic events which occurred in my country and resulted in the death of three citizens trapped in a bank when extremist elements in a large, completely peaceful rally, set fire to it."
"I should like to take this tragic opportunity, because I know that all of Europe and all the European media are watching Greece today, to ask all my fellow Members here to demonstrate responsibility, gravitas, solidarity and, most importantly, respect towards a nation going through such a difficult time."
"I say that, because I fear that, as of tomorrow, certain major European newspapers in certain capitals will maintain, precisely on the basis of these tragic events, that their fears and doubts as to whether Greece can and is determined to implement the very difficult decisions which it has taken on financial reform are justified."
"Because, the very day after the agreement last Sunday, the same story started that we have heard since the 11 February, with a series of comments on the inefficacy of the Greek measures and on the prospects for restructuring the Greek debt, with speculation as to whether the country might leave the euro area and, of course, with new attacks by the markets both on Greek bonds and on Portuguese and Spanish bonds."
"I wonder, given that we are also debating the prospects of the 2020 strategy, where this will lead."
"Where are we heading with this absolute dependency of national economies on market crises, on ratings by credit rating agencies which answer to no one and whose ratings, be they right or wrong, about companies or states, especially states in the euro area, have absolutely no consequences and are subject to no form of control?"
"(Applause)"
"(RO) During the last two years, we have faced the most severe global economic crisis."
"Consequently, it is vitally important for our efforts to be targeted better in order to provide a fillip to competitiveness, productivity and the potential for economic growth."
"The strategy's objectives must be realistic."
"This is why they must be defined in close correlation with Member States' national objectives, which are themselves defined according to the priorities and specific features of each Member State."
"As a result, I wish to welcome the notion that the objectives adopted at Community level should be divided into various national objectives."
"As part of a Parliament resolution, I asked the Commission to table new measures, such as possible sanctions for Member States which fail to apply the strategy and incentives for those which do."
"In fact, funding from the European Union should be conditional not only on achieving results, but also on compatibility with the strategy's objectives."
"However, we must not ignore the importance of the cohesion policy in achieving the European Union's economic and development objectives."
"We must therefore scrutinise the Commission's proposals closely because a proposal like this to automatically suspend the Structural Funds in the case of Member States with a large budget deficit would be an unrealistic measure and completely at variance with the cohesion policy's objectives, specifically those aimed at reducing the disparities between Member States."
"- (CS) The European Union represents the largest geopolitical entity in the world in terms of population."
"Our success to date, which we must approach with great humility in the current crisis period, consists in the ability of our economies to develop their capacities for innovation and exports in particular."
"This is especially clear with respect to competitors like the US and Japan, but also China, India and Brazil."
"In this context I consider it key to retain the strategic focus particularly on economic growth and jobs."
"Social problems and climate change must not, in this regard, be allowed to distract attention from the main goals."
"At the same time, we must bear in mind that an essential precondition for intelligent and sustainable growth in our Member States and their regions and municipalities is sufficient infrastructure, from both a transport and an environmental perspective."
"This factor is not taken into account sufficiently in the Europe 2020 strategy, and the essential focus on continuing and strengthening investments in the development of infrastructure is therefore entirely lacking, especially in those states and regions where it is insufficiently developed at present."
"Mr President, the key strategy the EU Commission has for Europe up to 2020 is reliance on neoliberal capitalism and a market system - in other words, the exact same factors that have plunged the world into the current economic chaos and illustrated in the Commission's and EU governments' response to the financial crisis in Greece: a shameful capitulation to the speculation and profiteering by the sharks in the financial markets; demanding that the Greek working class, pensioners and poor should have their services and living standards savaged to feed the insatiable greed of these financial markets, which are not some kind of an all-powerful god, as media commentators would have us believe, but investment banks, hedge-fund operators, bond holders and the like - parasites seeking super profits by deliberately speculating to create financial instability and then exploiting that to bleed working people."
"Is this the Europe we want for 2020?"
"It is pathetic to hear Mr Barroso appeal to them for responsibility: ask a shark to give up its taste for blood!"
"The fightback by the Greek working class should be supported by workers all over Europe."
"We have to break the dictatorship of the market."
"That will be done not by idiots burning banks, but by sustained and mass mobilisations and strike action of working people and replacing this diseased system with democratic socialism and a real human society to be created by 2020."
"- (SK) With all due respect to the documents submitted, their similarity to the five-year plans that were supposed to bring prosperity to the Eastern Bloc cannot be overlooked."
"They even begin by acknowledging that the previous strategy was not, for various reasons, successful."
"They then set out bold objectives and try to convince people that everything really will be better this time."
"It was not better, however."
"Strategies came and went, and the economy collapsed."
"Those strategies failed to respect the basic rules of economic life."
"Europe today is running out of steam despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of educated people than more successful countries such as China or India."
"Why is this?"
"Because it responds to every new problem in the same way as the European Council or the Commission, by setting up another new institution or another authority."
"Most educated Europeans then disappear into the bowels of various organisations, and these millions of educated people, who at the same time could be working creatively in other areas, for example on innovations and development in the productive sector, just move bits of paper around in offices and siphon off common resources."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we really want to be more successful, we must above all simplify the rules of coexistence and business and reduce the administrative burden."
"We must create more space for applying the independence, entrepreneurship and creativity of people, and we must redirect the money we are currently spending on administration towards progress and support for innovation and development in the productive sector."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the community of Europe, a credible political union, sustainable growth, sustainable employment and innovation, social cohesion and sustainable competitiveness are our goals."
"Europe 2020 is not our goal."
"Europe 2020 must be an instrument to enable us to achieve our goals."
"It must become our Robert Schuman declaration of 2010 and be as tangible as that was on 9 May 1950."
"Europe 2020 must not degenerate into a collection of unattainable desires for the future or a dustbin full of all of our unresolved issues, problems and frustrations."
"It must be a tangible, financeable, sustainable instrument that provides an answer to the crisis and it must be a motivating, testable project of the European Union that we are able to sanction."
"Europe 2020 must set in motion specific projects for growth, employment, research, innovation and sustainable competitiveness."
"We need to review our finances in all Member States and in the European Union in order to have an honest starting point for our future plans and also so that we know what we need to finance and what we need the money for."
"We also need a Europe 2020 suitability check for our national policies on the budget, tax, research, energy, innovation and social affairs."
"We should give our full support to Mr Rehn's measures."
"Europe 2020 must be an expression of the new, common political will and our response to the, sadly, increasing nationalism, egoism and protectionism."
"Let us complete the internal market and, alongside the monetary union, create a strong economic union that is part of a credible political union."
"That is what we need, no more and no less."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must confess my concern over the June summit, because I do not see anything new in the debate capable of rectifying the recommendations of the spring Council."
"Those recommendations were already disappointing because they were not based on the slightest criticism of the limitations of Lisbon and the consequences of the failure to implement some of the most important political and cultural plans which had been made at that time."
"They are also disappointing because they ignore the crisis: 10 points are set out in a general fashion, with no logical connection between them; they are the sum of good intentions which do not, however, appear to form a policy."
"And we are still in the same position."
"I also fail to see a tangible desire to identify priorities."
"Europe's problem is its level of competitiveness in the global system."
"Therefore, it cannot disregard social cohesion, one of the fundamental factors of competitiveness."
"Without cohesion, no country - let alone a supranational group - is capable of remaining on the world market, since it would have internal conflicts causing it to become less competitive every day."
"On the other hand, there is the issue of innovation: it is not enough just to mention it; we must establish specific objectives, which are not set out in the recommendations, on the amount of resources to earmark for innovation, both of products and of processes."
"Only quality, both in civil life, in work and, on the other hand, in the production of goods and services, can put Europe back on a competitive footing following the extremely serious consequences of this crisis."
"Lastly, I would add that there is an issue which is never mentioned: we can pursue ambitious goals if we also have political integration."
"The Member States do not talk about this, they have closed the subject: the appalling management of the Greek crisis is there to prove it."
"- (CS) I come from a Member State where, up to the age of 28 or 29, I lived under a system based on central planning, where life was regulated under five-year plans, and all of the five-year plans were always replaced with new plans, because the previous plans were never fulfilled."
"Please forgive me, therefore, if I am perhaps sensitive or over-sensitive when it comes to planning how Europe will look in 2020, and if, during this certainly interesting debate, we do not pay regard or we pay less regard to what is happening today not only in Greece, but throughout the euro area."
"I have been listening very closely to the debate in this Chamber all afternoon and I have been hearing calls for more Europe, more centralisation, more central control."
"At this moment and in this debate, I would like to respond that we need less centralisation, we need more confidence in the market and we need more of the market and of market mechanisms, because what is actually happening today, not only in the EU and not only in the euro area, but also in the United States and in other countries of this kind, is a story of unbelievable failure of all state intervention."
"(ES) Mr President, many fellow Members have wondered why the Lisbon Agenda failed and whether we should start by analysing that failure in order to take the next steps."
"In my view, the problem with the Lisbon Agenda was that it was ultimately nothing more than a symbol enclosed in a bubble, which was not implemented at all in practice."
"In the end we found that on the one hand there was a theory, the Lisbon Agenda, about which we were all talking, and on the other hand there was the practice, which had nothing to do with it."
"Therefore, in my view, based on this experience the Europe 2020 strategy must be a new agenda that can only be taken forward if there is a resounding commitment - I would stress, a resounding commitment - from all the institutions: the European political institutions and the national political institutions."
"This commitment also needs to be one that can be verified and evaluated; it needs to be one that we have information about and an immediate capacity to correct if the commitments are not being fulfilled when there are failures."
"This is so that we do not find ourselves in any situation of extreme circumstances."
"Either we all understand that this joint project needs these instruments in order to move forward, or we will soon be in a similar situation."
"(DE) Mr President, the theme of the Lisbon Strategy was competitiveness and it was a very strongly one-sided economic strategy, which, of course, in part has failed."
"I am therefore very pleased that the theme of the EU 2020 strategy is now sustainability."
"That is the right way to go and it also involves a better balance between economic, social and environmental developments and needs."
"The disadvantage of sustainability is that it is a very general concept that can also lack substance."
"We therefore need to make it more specific."
"In this regard, the Commission's paper is much too vague, as there are too many pieces of the picture missing to allow us to implement it."
"A resource-efficient Europe is the right approach - we have meagre energy reserves and meagre raw material reserves - but there is a lack of targets and instruments to bring us to this point of resource efficiency in our production and in our consumption."
"In this regard, I hope that by June we will have something rather more tangible and that we will know precisely what each of us has to do - what the Commission will do, what Parliament will do and what the Member States will have to do."
"In relation to this resource-efficient Europe, the environment seems to have been somewhat forgotten, because air, water, land and also ecosystems are resources too."
"That has been completely lost."
"I would therefore like to hear more from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in respect of what we want to do in this regard."
"The biodiversity strategy has failed."
"A new one has, of course, been drawn up to take us to 2020 and this point must be taken into account in this strategy."
"Climate protection has certainly been tossed about many times."
"I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency."
"This is still too vague - we need to make it legally binding."
"(PL) Mr President, the Europe 2020 strategy we are discussing has, above all, an ideological dimension."
"It expresses many laudable objectives, such as an increase in labour participation and achievement of tertiary education diplomas by 40% of EU citizens, and also increased expenditure on innovation."
"It is curious that no sanctions have been foreseen for countries which do not fulfil the obligation to implement such beautiful ideas."
"One might have the impression that the authors of the strategy are not paying the slightest attention to the serious crisis in Greece, or to what might happen soon in Spain and Portugal - events which might lead not only to disintegration of the euro area, but also to erosion of the European Union."
"At such a dramatic moment for Europe, a recommendation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% is consistently being put forward, for example - something which will stifle the economies of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland."
"These countries may also lose out as a result of restrictions placed on cohesion policy."
"There are many indications that the utopian and socialist 2020 project will share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Let us hope that, in the meantime, it does not do any more damage."
"Mr President, for any strategy to be effective, creating strong links between its objectives and available policy tools is, in my view, essential, and I see four main policy tools as delivery mechanisms for the EU 2020 strategy."
"Firstly, the most important is internal market regulation that stimulates competition and economic dynamism and recognises social obligations that result from economic integration; and on that point I would like to strongly support what Malcolm Harbour said."
"Secondly, this is capital investment in transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures."
"We need capital investment on an unprecedented scale."
"Both public and private financing must therefore be mobilised; in particular public/private partnerships must be strongly promoted and European financial institutions must be strengthened to overcome growth funding barriers generated by deficit and debt buyers of national budgets."
"Thirdly, this is public expenditure through the European budget."
"As the EU's objectives are primarily horizontal and not sectorial, EU budget expenditure should be based on an integrated approach to development, combined with strengthened financial and engineering instruments, and promote opening of our economies to global competition."
"Fourthly, this is the coordination of national budget expenditures in priority areas through the open method of coordination."
"However, the soft mechanisms of this method - even if improved - can unfortunately take us only some way towards the agreed objectives of EU 2020; hence it can only be a supporting tool."
"European coordination must be focused on areas where genuine European value added exists or can develop, and where it will not undermine competition."
"Available policy tools must be used in a way guaranteeing that the trap of a strong interventionist growth model driven by traditional sectorial industrial policy is avoided."
"This could undermine investment and business attractiveness of Europe, reducing its growth potential."
"EU 2020 must be a growth and jobs strategy because there is no other option."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial, economic and social crisis that we are going through is unprecedented."
"It is hitting our continent and its peoples hard, it is causing huge social and human difficulties, and Greece, unfortunately, is a harsh and shameful example of this for us."
"Unemployment is constantly rising."
"Already, millions of Europeans are jobless, and the figure is rising from one day to the next."
"The response must be political, strong, swift and coordinated, and it must take into account the serious environmental crisis that we are going through, which requires a new development model."
"These many crises give rise, among our fellow citizens, to a great deal of expectation and to a hope to which the Europe 2020 strategy should have responded."
"However, in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale, the response has not materialised, and I regret that."
"The guidelines laid down in March by the European Council are not up to the task."
"There is no determination, no ambition, but, unfortunately, that does not surprise me any more."
"Everywhere, you Members of the Council and of the Commission, you and your Commissioners boast about the consistency of your policies."
"However, I have the impression that this is just an umbrella concept to disguise your lack of action."
"You do not have a consistent strategy combining economic, social, trade, industrial, agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development."
"Moreover, the external dimension of European trade-related action is nowhere to be found or is under the auspices of the untouchable liberal 'global Europe' dogma."
"We want trade to be a proper instrument that helps to create jobs and growth, to combat poverty and to promote development."
"However, you are pursuing - not for technical reasons, but for political reasons - a different objective: you are racing to reduce costs and to cut wages, you are racing to conclude bilateral free trade agreements to the detriment of multilateralism, thereby causing social and fiscal dumping."
"That policy is responsible for too many job losses, too many relocations and too much social damage to carry on as it is."
"To conclude, we expect the Commission and the Council to rekindle the European spirit, and to reject national self-interest so as to make Europe a haven not just of prosperity, but of solidarity too."
"Ensuring that Europe projects a different image of itself not only to its own citizens, but also to the rest of the world: that is what the resolution by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is all about."
"(DE) Mr President, there is actually little point in commenting on the remarks made by the right and left political fringes in this House, as they are in fact unimportant in this sensible House that is maintained by political forces interested in the development of Europe."
"However, if the EU 2020 strategy is now being compared with a Communist five-year plan, we would have to tell these people to look up economic policy in a text book and read the history of it."
"Then they will see the differences."
"Those on the far left - not those sensible forces here who sit slightly to the left of us - are now saying that Europe should more or less revert to Communist times."
"Part of Europe has, regrettably, experienced Communism and we all know what came of that."
"We can wish for many things, but the important thing is that we enable our citizens to live a life of dignity and prosperity in which they can enjoy education and the other services provided by society."
"It is therefore also necessary for us, as a political system, to consider how we can use the existing resources in the best way possible."
"It is simply a question of carrying out this planning."
"Every family and every local authority considers what to do with its resources to make sure that it can make headway over a certain time."
"That is a sensible thing to do."
"Up to now, only a market economy - with boundaries, not an unrestrained market - has actually been able to provide these services over the long term."
"It therefore makes sense for us to consider at European level how we can organise this market economy in Europe."
"To think purely within national borders is no longer a successful strategy and is destined to fail."
"We therefore need to consider how we can make this European market serve the people."
"It is not about competitiveness as such, but about ensuring that Europe is competitive so that services can be provided for the people."
"It is all about this debate."
"Many fellow Members have already gone into the details."
"I would like to limit myself to these general statements."
"However, to those on the fringes we will have to say from time to time: consider what you say, but above all read the history books!"
"(RO) At the moment, the unemployment rate in the European Union has hit 10%, while the rate of youth unemployment has reached 20%."
"This year there was no cause for celebration on 1 May, which is International Workers' Day, because there are 23 million unemployed in the European Union."
"We must clearly establish the sectors in the EU requiring investment in order to provide jobs."
"Only education will enable us to provide young people with the skills they need to get a job and make a decent living."
"Investments in agriculture will also ensure that the European Union can provide the basic necessities for itself in terms of food and biofuels."
"Investments in the transport infrastructure are crucial."
"This year we are reviewing the list of TEN-T priority projects."
"The EU needs a high-speed rail transport network, which will service all the European Union capitals and Europe's major cities."
"It also has to modernise the road infrastructure, ports and airports."
"I believe that the European Union must invest in the development of the transport infrastructure in Eastern Europe as a priority."
"This is the only way of enabling us to have a really effective internal market."
"However, all these projects require financial resources amounting to many billions of euros, which will be recouped in the public budgets through taxes and duties and, especially, through the jobs created and the economic development generated."
"In addition, the investments in the energy infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy sources will reduce the EU's energy dependency and generate roughly 2.7 million new jobs by 2030."
"However, instead of investing in the Smart Cities initiative, we notice that more than EUR 150 million from the European Economic Recovery Plan remains unspent."
"Last but not least, the European Union must invest in research and in the sustainable development of European industry."
"Mr President, I would like to end with an appeal to the Commission and the Council to create an instrument similar to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in support of the public sector workers who have lost their jobs due to the economic crisis."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I think we all know what a great task lies ahead of us."
"We have to formulate a joint strategy for Member States and European Union institutions that will ensure that the after-effects of the crisis will be dealt with, at the same time enabling the Union and all its Member States to be competitive in the global economic environment and to develop in an environmentally sustainable fashion so that all citizens of the Union will promptly feel their standard of living rise even in the short term."
"I would like to make two remarks, however, about the new strategy which I believe covers the basics, but it is important to mention two things."
"First, a certain caution and prudence are justified with respect to quantifiable goals."
"These have to be ambitious yet realistic and attainable, paying heed to where each Member State started and its capacities."
"Poverty means one thing in the United Kingdom and another in Bulgaria."
"Our education systems are different."
"The question arises, for instance, as to whether increasing the proportion of people with a university degree to 40% is worthwhile everywhere, or whether we are not simply increasing the number of unemployed university graduates."
"However, I think the improvement of vocational training should in any case be included among our goals."
"My second remark is that the strategy should reinforce the EU's internal cohesion, in other words its convergence."
"I agree that key sectors should receive assistance because they are the engine of the European economy."
"At the same time it must be remembered that internal differences among the 27 Member States at various stages of development would only widen if we pursued a one-sided economic development policy that stressed competitiveness without addressing Member States' distinctive features."
"Without internal cohesion there can be no external competitiveness."
"Closing the gap with underdeveloped areas would mean wider markets, effective demand and innovative potential for the entire Union while requiring less social care."
"A framework must be set up for the less developed areas that will enable them to take advantage of the opportunities of the internal market."
"In time everyone would thus become competitive on their own strength."
"I hope we will find room for the cohesion policy in the new strategy."
"(LT) Today we are discussing the kind of European Union we would like to see in ten years' time."
"At present unemployment, especially among young people, is one of the European Union's greatest problems, and, unfortunately, this is forcing us to refer to today's young people as this era's lost generation."
"We are talking about the creation of new jobs, protection of the environment, we are talking about promoting youth initiatives, about support for the education system, about many other important elements, but mostly we are talking about these as if they were separate things and we are missing the bigger picture."
"Unfortunately, reading the current proposals on the EU's Europe 2020 strategy, I get the feeling that once again this may simply remain empty words, if we fail to take into account the opinions of those who will have to implement this strategy, in other words, young people."
"I would like the Europe 2020 strategy to be a link between the economy and ecology that precisely young people would help implement, so that this becomes an opportunity for young people to offer their knowledge and create the European Union's future."
"Since I myself am a representative of those same young people implementing the strategy, I would like to offer a few concrete proposals."
"First of all, let us promote the creation of green jobs, that is, let us provide for opportunities to give greater support to businesses creating green jobs and employing young people, whether it be in agriculture, manufacturing or the transport and services sectors."
"Secondly, let us devote more attention to environmentalism, or to be more precise, to environmental education, both integrating it into education programmes and presenting it as a new discipline."
"Once we have taken these two steps, we will attract more young people to participate in creating the green economy: young people who have enough knowledge, skills and, I believe, determination."
"I would really like there to be less scepticism here in the European Parliament and fewer unfounded comparisons, such as we heard yesterday, and there to be more determination, optimism and unity."
"(RO) I firmly believe that Europe 2020 will create a more economically powerful and more innovative Europe."
"I am also convinced that we will successfully emerge from the current economic and financial crisis because we have huge potential in terms of an innovative labour market, as well as natural resources."
"I welcome the efforts made by the Commission to present this communication to us."
"However, I feel obliged to raise the cohesion policy for discussion and express my dissatisfaction that the path towards implementing the Lisbon Strategy seems to have changed tack."
"Achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion involves factors other than those relating to growth which is smart, sustainable and conducive to inclusion."
"Citizens are saying through us and our elected representatives that they still need investments in infrastructure, access to services and the development of all regions, no matter how isolated they are."
"The priorities set for the 2007-2013 period have shown what a great need there is to improve the infrastructure and support economic competitiveness in the convergence areas."
"Interdependence among economies shows the need for cohesion and ensuring [...]"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, may I start by expressing my condolences from this tribune of the European Parliament for my three fellow countrymen who were killed today in incidents in Athens."
"I am honestly sorry that we did not hear condolences from President Barroso on behalf of the Commission."
"I hope that Mr Rehn, who represents him, will rectify this in his second statement."
"The second thing I want to say is that the Commission needs to act now, because the longer you delay in finding a solution to the problems faced by Europe today, and hence the problem of Greece, the more you undermine the 2020 targets."
"2020 is based on 2010."
"The objective of less poverty is based on today."
"With the measures that it is being forced to take, Greece will not be able to contribute towards this objective."
"You need to help Greece, because otherwise, 40%, who are young university graduates, will have no jobs."
"Think about it and act now."
"(DE) Thank you very much Mr President."
"Mr Barroso talked about measures that we need to take in connection with Europe 2020, but then he left the Chamber."
"He will now miss one of the most important measures."
"I am therefore going to address the Spanish Presidency and thank the President-in-Office of the Council for remaining here and following the debate to its conclusion."
"One of the most important measures that needs to be taken in the context of Europe 2020 is the employment of sustainable development in order to exploit the potential for green jobs."
"This requires a comprehensive initiative for these potential green jobs."
"In this connection, it must be ensured that transformations and workers' rights are also taken into account and that there is an initiative in place for training and further training."
"I know that the Spanish and Belgian Presidencies are working on this and I would like to expressly encourage you to continue to do so and to present a Council initiative before the end of the year."
"Mr President, we are discussing Europe 2020 - which will be in 10 years' time - but I think we ought perhaps to reflect on the last 10 hours."
"It was with great sadness that I learnt of the deaths in Greece; it is very sad."
"I feel sorry for the families, and my condolences go to the families and friends of those poor people who have died."
"However, a few weeks back, in Parliament, I did warn of civil unrest over the situation with the eurozone and the problems it now faces."
"I think it is time that this Parliament, the Commission and the Council woke up to the fact that the eurozone is flawed: it is not working."
"We have seen problems in Greece."
"I feel it will carry on to Spain and, before more lives are lost, is it not time for some honesty here, and that we should really look at the situation regarding the eurozone countries and admit that it is flawed?"
"(PL) Mr President, the EU economy continues to be the strongest, but this eldorado will not necessarily last forever."
"The crisis and the tragic events in Greece have shown us that we must draw some conclusions from the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy, today."
"In contradistinction to the Lisbon strategy, we need boldness and consistency in the implementation of Europe 2020."
"Whether we make it possible for future generations to live in a cohesive and wealthy Europe, or whether we leave them in a Europe dominated by a crisis, depends upon us."
"Today, 30% of Europeans do not have vocational qualifications."
"This explains the ambitious plans relating to education: to reduce the number of early school leavers to 10%, and for 16 million people to achieve tertiary qualifications."
"Therefore, my appeal can be summarised by saying that, today, the great educational challenges must be pursued very conscientiously and quickly."
"I appeal for coordinated and very consistent action from all EU institutions and Member States."
"(SK) It is a pity that the President of the Commission did not stay here, even though he has some important tasks, although in my opinion Europe 2020 is a supremely important strategic document, and I do not know what could be more important for the President at the moment."
"It is, however, clear from the debate which has taken place here across the political spectrum that this document has not aroused any great enthusiasm in the European Parliament."
"It must be stated objectively that the situation in Europe at the time of planning this document is very complicated and that the document has come into being against the background of one of the worst economic crises in living memory."
"In my opinion, one of the most important things for the strategy to resolve is therefore the protection of the most economically vulnerable people, who were living in difficult conditions before the crisis, who continue to live in such conditions today and who did not cause the crisis."
"I therefore think - and this is a concrete suggestion concerning this document - that it would be a good thing if the guideline which applies to the area of poverty and social exclusion were brought into the mainstream, so that it is not a second-class guideline applying just to the area of employment, but a cross-sectional one applying to all of these important areas."
"(HU) The strategy for the future of Europe is built on the basis of two value systems, and I would like to draw attention to the fact that these two value systems can only be reconciled with great difficulty, if at all, so we ought to choose between them."
"The key words for one of the value systems are competitiveness, growth, globalisation, while for the other, the key word is sustainability."
"We are talking about sustainability in the environmental sense."
"We know that forced growth and globalisation have dreadful consequences for the environment."
"There is no question of sustainability."
"We are talking about sustainability in the social sense."
"Those people, smallholders, small and medium-sized enterprises, among others, who cannot keep up with the overheated competition and globalisation go under, fall out of competition and become impoverished."
"This is completely contrary to sustainability in the social sense."
"My electorate and myself are of the opinion that between the two value systems we have to choose sustainability."
"Mr President, I would like to start by answering the direct question put to me by Mr Bokros."
"This subject was also referred to by Mr Cofferati, who is not currently present, and by Mrs del Castillo, who is also not present."
"Others have also referred to it."
"Why did the Lisbon Strategy fail?"
"This was the direct question asked by Mr Bokros."
"I definitely believe that there are many reasons, and it would be a little excessive and arrogant to try to simplify the situation."
"However, if I had to choose one of those reasons to explain the lack of success of the Lisbon Strategy, I think that the most conclusive one is that the European Union - which adopted the single market at the time, which adopted a single currency - has not taken the necessary step towards economic union."
"That step has not been taken."
"The Treaty of Maastricht talked about economic and monetary union."
"We have remained in monetary union and have not moved on to economic union."
"This is why I believe that the Europe 2020 strategy needs to be part of a new phase for the Union, which is the step towards economic union."
"This economic union means, most importantly, economic and social governance of the Union."
"A fundamental element of that economic union is a strategy for growth and creating high-quality employment, which is essentially the purpose of this debate."
"It is a debate that I have found to be very interesting and extremely rich in terms of contributions, and it also has new, important dimensions that were not part of the Lisbon Strategy or did not have the same emphasis in it."
"For example, the technological dimension or the social dimension that Mr Cofferati, Mr Cercas and Mr Arif mentioned, and the dimension of combating climate change, which links to what Mrs Schroedter was saying."
"However, it is not possible to achieve economic union simply by having a strategy for growth and creating quality employment."
"That is not all."
"This would answer the question from Mrs Harms, who is not currently present."
"In addition, we need something that Commissioner Rehn - who is going to speak next - is working on, and which I alluded to earlier."
"We need coordination of economic policies, employment policies and social policies, which has not happened in Europe and did not happen with the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is also something that the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to do."
"Article 5 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Member States must, are obliged to - it is not optional - coordinate their economic policies and their employment policies."
"They could also, if they wanted to - and in my opinion they should - coordinate their social policies."
"In addition to a strategy for growth and job creation, and to coordinating economic and employment policies, we need European supervision of the financial markets."
"This is the supervision package that I was referring to before and on which I had a response from Mr Verhofstadt."
"I am delighted that he is in favour of the European Parliament adopting its position on the financial supervision package as soon as possible."
"In addition to this, something that Mr Barroso particularly emphasised in his speech: we need to have an external dimension."
"Europe's economic union needs to have an external dimension; a single external position, namely in the G20."
"I am referring to what Mr Barroso said, which I almost completely agree with."
"What we also need for economic union is governance institutions: a European Council that launches the strategic lines, a Commission that monitors and executes the strategy and legislative bodies for the strategy: the Council and the European Parliament."
"In addition, we need instruments to incentivise this strategy, such as the authorisation of the Structural Funds and the European funds to guide this strategy, something that did not exactly happen - or at least did not happen to a great extent - during the years of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is what I think is already taking place in the European Union: a step towards the next phase, the phase that the 21st century requires."
"This phase is that of globalisation, which is economic union."
"Not just the internal market or monetary union, but also economic union."
"That is the path we must follow, and we need to do it consistently, with interinstitutional dialogue, such as is happening here this afternoon, and we need to do it as swiftly as possible."
"I think this is what the European people are asking of all of us."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me thank you for a very rich and responsible debate this evening and let me also correct one claim concerning President Barroso."
"He did express his condolences on behalf of the Commission."
"I want to join him and express my condolences to the families and friends of the victims of violence in Athens today."
"Disagreement in democracy is normal, but recourse to violence is never acceptable."
"Sustainable growth and job creation is indeed at the heart of Europe 2020 and I want to say some words about financial stability, which is a necessary condition of returning to sustainable growth and to the goals of Europe 2020."
"You may call it 'Europe 2010', because we need that in order to succeed as Europe 2020."
"The decision of the euro-area Member States last Sunday to activate the mechanism of coordinated and conditional financial assistance for Greece was not an easy decision, but a necessary decision."
"It was the responsible and right thing to do."
"The Commission's task now is to ensure that the bilateral launch will be coordinated and that conditionality will be systematically and rigorously applied."
"The financial support gives Greece breathing space to restore the sustainability of its public finances, as well as its overall economic competitiveness."
"This is needed not only for Greece, but in order to safeguard financial stability in Europe, to avoid the bush-fire in Greece turning into a forest fire in Europe."
"Financial stability is necessary for Europe's ongoing economic recovery for sustainable growth and job creation."
"Some of you mentioned the contagion effect and concerns related to other countries of the euro area or of the European Union."
"No one can deny that there have been tensions in the financial markets in recent days and weeks but, as in all financial markets, there is significant overshooting."
"All euro-area Member States are taking measures to consolidate their public finances, not least Portugal and Spain."
"Greece is a unique and particular case in the euro area, and now the European Union."
"Specifically, the euro-area Member States, together with the Commission, ECB and IMF, are taking care of the Greek case."
"I am confident that we will succeed and overcome the formidable challenges."
"We must also learn the lessons of the crisis; that is important for economic governance of Europe 2020."
"The latest developments in the European economy, not least around Greece, have shown that there is a pressing and urgent need to strengthen economic governance in Europe."
"Next week the Commission will make concrete proposals on how we can reinforce economic policy coordination and Member States budgetary surveillance in the European Union."
"In the Economic and Monetary Union the 'M' has been much stronger than the 'E'."
"It is high time to fill the 'E' with life."
"This was also the underlying idea of the founding fathers of the Economic and Monetary Union."
"Our guiding principle is that prevention is always more effective than correction and, therefore, we will build our proposals on the basis of reinforcing prevention, as well as correction also."
"The main building blocks of our proposals are threefold."
"Firstly, we need to reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact, both its preventive and corrective arms."
"We need a more systematic and rigorous preventive budgetary surveillance, so that cases like the Greek case will never happen again."
"Secondly, we must go beyond budgetary surveillance."
"We need to address macro-economic imbalances and divergences in competitiveness and, therefore, we need to reinforce both export competitiveness, which is urgently needed in many countries, and domestic demand where needed and possible."
"The third building block will be a crisis-resolution mechanism."
"The financial mechanism for Greece serves the immediate need for the current purposes."
"However, it is clear and necessary that we need to set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism with strong in-built conditionalities and also disincentives for its use."
"As President Barroso said earlier today, it is better to be safe than sorry, and ensure that we are also equipped to face the worst scenarios."
"In conclusion, I count on your support."
"I count on the European Parliament to support reinforcing economic governance in Europe."
"I also call on the Heads of State and Government of the euro-area Member States on Friday, as well as the European Council more broadly, to support our proposals and proceed rapidly without delay in making these proposals effective and a reality."
"Why so?"
"Because we have no luxury of time and, instead, I urge everyone to take decisions as soon as possible, so that we can make Europe 2020 a success and create real foundations for sustainable growth and job creation in Europe."
"That is what our citizens are expecting from us."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the second part-session in May."
"(The sitting was suspended for five minutes due to technical issues)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (LT) Europe is going through a difficult period caused by the global economic crisis, the recovery is still fragile and Member States are paying a different price to overcome the crisis."
"The European Union needs a new strategy directed at creating new jobs, investing in education, safeguarding opportunities for lifelong learning and improving living conditions."
"I would like to draw attention to one of the Commission's most important commitments to reduce poverty in Europe and increase social inclusion."
"However, I would like to stress that while striving to meet this commitment we must take specific measures, such as the strengthening of compulsory minimum social standards and the minimum wage throughout the EU, and it is also necessary to establish additional measures to ensure protection of the most vulnerable social groups."
"I would also like to point out that the objectives set out in the new strategy constitute one common goal of Europe as a whole that we must aim for through action at both national and EU level."
"I therefore call on the Commission to continue the dialogue with the Member States, so that national decisions correspond with the EU's fundamental goals, because only then will the strategy yield concrete results instead of simply being a collection of fine slogans."
"It is absolutely necessary for both the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy to support the European strategy for employment and economic growth."
"I believe that the CAP must offer immediate solutions to the impact which the economic crisis is having on agricultural enterprises, such as the lack of access to credit for farmers, constraints on farming incomes and rising unemployment in rural areas."
"It must also continue to offer solutions to the threat posed by land abandonment, to rural depopulation and the ageing rural population in the European Union in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of rural communities in the European Union."
"I must also mention that in the light of these challenges, after 2013 the CAP must send out strong signals and provide answers to the concerns of both the rural community and wider society through a strong, sustainable, well-funded, credible and multi-functional food policy."
"I wish to stress the urgent need to attract generations of young people to rural areas and to come up with new, alternative economic opportunities to ensure a sustainable rural population."
"I also believe that rural unemployment should be resolved by offering opportunities for diversification and for new sources of income."
"in writing. - I want to thank the Commission and the Council for their statements on the new European strategy for jobs and growth."
"I consider that setting the new energy targets will be a key factor in achieving a more resource-efficient Europe by 2020."
"I want to stress to the Commission that some Member States will need special support in order to be able to develop and implement renewable technologies to achieve the 20% target for energy produced from renewable sources."
"I wish to emphasise the positive impact of supporting the Digital Agenda initiatives as part of the flagship initiatives for new skills and jobs, and I would like to see the Commission coming forward with concrete legislative proposals to address the development of the online environment by creating facilities, both financial and administrative, to promote online businesses and e-Commerce."
"In terms of research and innovation in Europe, I welcome the reply from Commissioner Quinn regarding the need to improve the research infrastructure in the new Member States."
"Research institutes and scientists are waiting for rapid, coordinated action from the Commission and Council in order to tackle this issue, so as to allow them equal opportunities for participation in Framework Programmes."
"The profound crisis into which the neoliberalism that dominates Europe has led the continent, has led the authors of the 2020 strategy to try to wrap their objectives in social and environmental rhetoric, propaganda which has been abundantly propagated."
"Even so, this rhetoric has dropped the goals of 'full employment' and 'poverty eradication' that we found in its predecessor, the Lisbon Strategy."
"However, what we know of the instruments of the Europe 2020 strategy leaves little room for doubt: this is an old strategy that aims to justify old policies and make them viable, with well-known consequences."
"In the end, the increased flexibility and deregulation of the labour market, the primacy given to deepening the internal market, the liberalisation and privatisation of even more economic sectors, and the liberalisation and deregulation of international trade were, together, the instruments that brought about the current situation."
"To persist with those instruments is nothing less than really 'going for broke' and carrying on along the path to economic, social and environmental disaster."
"The more than 20 million unemployed are being used to impose a further devaluation of the workforce on the remaining workers, making the lack of job security widespread, employment intermittent, and unemployment structural."
"In the end, all the boasts of a 'social market economy' mean nothing more than the commercialisation of all sectors of social life, nature and natural resources."
"in writing. - (HU) In the European Union economic growth is at a standstill and unemployment is above 10%."
"This means we have to devise a strategy for sustainable growth and job creation that will be able to revitalise the Union."
"This depends on whether it will be capable of renewal, of placing the economy on new foundations, and whether its citizens will be able to live according to a new mindset."
"Such a renewal may be brought about in the European Union by innovation and by research and development."
"In the interest of the future of its citizens, the European Union is working on a 2020 growth strategy based on innovation and research and development, and could guarantee continued economic growth and provide its citizens with new jobs."
"Without resources, research and development cannot create the necessary financial background and therefore cannot make full use of innovation opportunities."
"Innovation is only possible as a result of partnership, of joint support."
"Resources come from three areas: the EU, Member States and the private sector."
"Innovation at company level requires appropriate human resources."
"This can be achieved by high quality education and training, operated through coordination at Member State level."
"Universities need support in order to produce young researchers who will be able to provide SMEs with continuous opportunities for innovation."
"In education, the two main trends that comprise innovative opportunities are digitisation and the decrease of energy consumption."
"in writing. - (RO) The escalation of the economic crisis in Greece, along with achieving a stable unemployment rate at around 10% in the European Union, makes it immediately necessary to implement the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The pursuit of these objectives must be based on credible, consolidated action aimed at exiting the crisis, with employment being one of the key items on this agenda."
"We all agree that the EU must have a highly qualified labour force capable of tackling the challenges it is facing now and in the future, in order to create a more competitive and sustainable economy."
"However, fine statements are not sufficient to resolve current problems."
"This is why I would like to remind you that urgent investments need to be made not only in suitable skills, but also in education systems, with a view to bringing them into line with the demands of the market."
"Member States must be proactive in keeping to the commitments they have assumed within the European Council."
"They must also take the measures required to help the EU emerge from the current crisis and boost economic growth."
"in writing. - The most important topic in the discussion about the future of the Europe 2020 strategy is the challenge of need and sustainability."
"Clearly the Lisbon strategy has not delivered and now we have to be realistic if the future Europe 2020 would be able to deliver."
"In order to make Europe 2020 a success story it is crucial that Member States, EU institutions and all actors in the society work on this together."
"A top-down and bottom-up approach have to meet each other."
"Realistic benchmarks have to be set to increase employment, especially youth employability."
"Education systems in Europe need to become more oriented towards research and innovation; higher investment in education is unavoidable."
"Better coherence needs to be created between the labour market and education."
"The concept of life-long and life-wide learning are to be tackled seriously."
"I strongly advocate better vocational education systems and support the need to work much closer with the private sector on this."
"In the increasingly competitive world, Europe needs to be ambitious and committed on all levels."
"Without this we will again have a strategy that resembles more the Soviet Union's five-year plans."
"A convincing European strategy to create a stronger Europe should take leadership on global level."
"in writing. - (HU) Integrated economic and employment guidelines are the nuts and bolts of the EU 2020 strategy."
"With regard to the draft employment directives, I feel it is important to mention that inclusive growth can only be achieved if the investment is actually made in people."
"A longer lifespan does not in itself mean a longer productive career."
"Investment in health is especially relevant in the case of Hungary, where people die at a much earlier age than in Western Europe, while at the same time the birth rate is decreasing."
"Appropriate abilities must be preserved even at an older age, and this is possible only with a more modern, more accessible health service."
"In other words, more thought should be given to accessible workplaces for an increasing number of older persons who remain active."
"This would also benefit younger but disabled people."
"Health thus merits special priority (for example, improvement of working conditions, more successful rehabilitation, facilitating the preservation of good health, and so on)."
"This is referred to, by the way, in Guideline 8 (investment in human resource development), albeit without special emphasis or concrete details."
"There are many debates on health care in Europe and around the world, and there is no uniform approach anywhere."
"Yet we have to realise that in order to ensure Europe's competitiveness in the longer term, the dependency rate must be kept in balance with a healthier and more active population."
"I ask that the European institutions consider this in their strategy and its implementation."
"in writing. - (RO) I support the Europe 2020 strategy promoting economic growth which is smart (based on knowledge and innovation), environmentally friendly and conducive to social inclusion."
"I would like this strategy to be implemented through the creation of well-paid jobs and an increase in people's standard of living."
"If we want to have a strong, well-balanced Europe, we need to focus a great deal of attention on economic development in the regions of the new Member States in order to reduce the existing disparities."
"It goes without saying that creating a suitable infrastructure must be a priority."
"I wish to stress the significance of implementing the symbolic 'Youth on the Move' initiative."
"We must increase funding for European programmes aimed at ensuring that education constantly keeps up to date at every level and at facilitating the mobility of teachers, students and researchers."
"The quality of education in European schools and universities must rise in keeping with the labour market's requirements."
"We must use appropriate policies and finances to encourage the learning of foreign languages, multidisciplinarity, double specialisations in universities, which are important in terms of performance in scientific research and innovation, as well as for increasing young people's chances on the labour market."
"I also welcome the fact that the 2020 strategy is proposing a 'Youth employment framework' at European level."
"in writing. - (RO) The history of the Lisbon Agenda has proved that fine ideas and principles are not enough: the key action is to implement the measures proposed."
"Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has dovetailed with the end of the Lisbon Agenda."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it would be wrong of us to lay the entire responsibility for the failure of this programme on the crisis, without attempting to see where the European Union has made mistakes in the implementation process."
"The lesson learnt will perhaps stand us in good stead for implementing the forthcoming EU 2020 strategy."
"I think that we have important Community instruments for implementing new strategies, by which I am referring primarily to the cohesion policy."
"However, the point must be emphasised that we cannot abandon the objectives of the cohesion policy to redistribute funds in order to achieve the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy."
"This would be a mistake entailing severe consequences for the Member States which need these funds to bridge the development gaps which separate them from the other states."
"It would result in the failure of the cohesion principle at European level."
"in writing. - (ET) Mr President, it is very much to be welcomed that the Commission has outlined the forward-looking 'Europe 2020: a strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth', because for too many years now, many European countries, in organising their economy and finances, have been following the maxim 'aprÃ¨s nous le dÃ©luge'."
"Despite the Commission's praiseworthy work on drawing up the strategy, it amazes me with its naivety."
"The Commission's statement on this paints us a picture of a green, equal Europe based on a social market economy, without being clear what kind of resources will be used to achieve this."
"In the Soviet Union, it was common practice at certain times to promise the arrival of communism after ten years, regardless of the actual reality."
"I would hope that, after the debacle of the declaratory Lisbon Strategy, the Commission did not want to come out with another empty-worded utopia with which to delude European citizens. What we need today is not dreams, but concrete actions to save the European economy from decline."
"It is high time that we began serious structural reforms in Europe, especially in the area of social policy, because the current type of social welfare model is no longer sustainable."
"Achieving a minimum 25% reduction in the EU poverty level by 2020 is closely linked to increasing the employment rate to 75%."
"Having a quantitative target for reducing poverty is problematic."
"Poverty includes economic, social, cultural and educational aspects, which means that qualitative targets are needed more for achieving the proposed objective rather than quantitative ones."
"In Romania the official data published in March 2010 indicates an employment level far below the minimum level envisaged by the EU 2020 strategy (50% as opposed to 75%), with the downward spiral continuing due to the current economic climate."
"Women, people aged over 45 and young people continue to have the most difficulty in finding work."
"It is hard to believe that Romania will be able to achieve this target by 2020."
"We need to find answers to questions relating to the contribution of the whole potential labour force and to our knowledge about the various groups in society: women and men, young people, the elderly and migrants on the labour market."
"Other questions relate to how we can reduce unemployment among young people and how we can effectively increase the participation of women in the labour market by widening their involvement in every business sector."
"If we fail to provide a clear answer to these questions, the two targets relating to employment growth and the reduction in the poverty level will meet the same fate as the Lisbon Agenda."
"in writing. - (EL) I should like to express my satisfaction with the conclusions of the March Council, because they acknowledge the importance of cohesion policy within the framework of Europe 2020 and thus plug the significant gap which existed in the Commission's initial text, which made no reference at all to cohesion policy."
"Also, both Mr Barroso and Commissioner Hahn have acknowledged the vital importance of the contribution of cohesion policy towards achieving this strategy."
"Cohesion policy has made a decisive contribution to strengthening competitiveness and employment, especially through 'earmarking', and we must make use of everything that has been achieved within this framework."
"However, this does not mean that cohesion policy will be reduced to a simple tool for implementing Europe 2020."
"Its potential is far greater."
"As a real expression of the principle of solidarity at local and regional level, it guarantees the viability of development initiatives and it guarantees that Europe 2020 will serve the EU's general objective of strengthening cohesion in all three dimensions, namely economic, social and territorial, and will not be confined to unilateral economic development."
"Finally, we need to use the potential of cohesion policy in order to avoid overlapping targets and funding between various European policies."
"in writing. - (HU) The EU 2020 strategy must foster a 'green revolution' in the European economy, an energy-saving, environmentally friendly and sustainable economic restructuring and green innovation."
"Development, however, must not mean merely aiding those European regions that already perform above average."
"We should, instead, focus the major part of development on supporting the most underdeveloped and disadvantaged regions."
"There are still enormous differences between Eastern and Western Europe in terms of economic efficiency."
"In Bulgaria, for example, three times more energy is needed to produce a unit of GDP than in Germany, so that if energy prices rise, the country's competitiveness will keep declining."
"While promoting the green restructuring of the economy, the European Union should not forget about the tried and tested community policies already in place, such as the common agricultural policy and the cohesion policy."
"The common agricultural policy will also be needed for reaching the targets set out for environmental protection and in the fight against climate change."
"The best stewards of the European countryside are the agricultural producers themselves."
"The EU 2020 strategy cannot succeed without the cohesion policy, either."
"The cohesion policy furnishes the entire set of tools and the flexibility needed for the EU's economic development policy."
"With the tools of the cohesion policy we are able to help reach goals in any specific field."
"For example, we can further the development of renewable energy sources, improve energy and resource efficiency, and support the green innovation."
"Ten years have passed since the Lisbon Strategy was adopted and the majority of its objectives remain unfulfilled."
"I am most concerned by the weak economic growth, because it is decisive for the other goals, and by the fact that in only two of the strategy's ten years of life did growth exceed 3%."
"The Lisbon Strategy was strong on ambition, but it lacked strength of action, having been based on soft law and the open method of coordination."
"As well as employment objectives, the new Europe 2020 Strategy incorporates goals relating to education, the environment, fighting poverty, and investment in innovation."
"Both the new objectives and the instruments for achieving them belong to the Member States so, in this context of crisis and commitment to stability and growth plans (SGPs), we need better governance mechanisms and real economic and budgetary coordination between countries."
"This programme is arriving at a time of economic uncertainty and high unemployment, the reduction of which is an immediate priority."
"The Commission must take the driving seat and lead this process."
"Strong economic growth will be crucial to keeping to SGPs and could be stimulated through the reforms and investment that underlie the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"in writing. - (HU) It is my belief that we have to dream bold dreams: the Europe 2020 document must extend to all areas of cooperation within the European Union and become a medium and long-term strategy for Europe."
"But for it to succeed there must be solidarity among the citizens of Europe."
"According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the new strategy is being prepared with contributions from the 27 members of the enlarged European Union, so that our citizens can feel they are sharing in a common European effort."
"The Hungarian voters in Romania expect the EU to express that solidarity by finding a rapid solution to bringing the South and East Central European regions up to par."
"The strategy has to address such topics as the longer range development of our countries, the internal market, the advancement of agriculture and SMEs, but also such sensitive issues as the social network, demographic challenges, equal opportunities on the job market, the intertwinement of European systems and networks in all aspects of life."
"The Europe 2020 strategy should be a strategy for catching up and convergence."
"During the debate on the Europe 2020 strategy we must not neglect a matter so important and significant as transport."
"The transport sector generates about 10% of the European Union's GDP and provides over 10 million jobs."
"It also plays a significant role in the context of the European internal market and the right to free movement of persons and goods."
"In my opinion, the matter of rail transport should be tackled decisively and quickly."
"I am sure that we can enlarge the trans-European railway corridor network by 2020."
"I think that starting from 2014 all new rolling stock and new rail transport connections should be equipped with systems which are compatible with the European Rail Traffic Management System."
"Accession agreement of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (debate)"
"The sitting is resumed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Accession agreement of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Madam President, today, in Athens, three people lost their first human right: the right to life."
"It was the result of violent acts that we absolutely and categorically condemn."
"The Spanish Presidency of the Council would like to express, on behalf of the Council, its condolences and sympathy to the families, and therefore echoes the statement made by the President of Parliament."
"We are talking about human rights, about adhering to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which as I said include the right to life and physical wellbeing."
"The European Union is based on human rights and freedoms, and throughout its life there have been constant references in the texts that have been adopted to rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The culmination of this is in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Firstly, for the first time in the history of Europe the Treaty of Lisbon incorporates a legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights of the citizens of the Union."
"It also says to the institutions that the Union will be party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"We are therefore witnessing the culmination of the Union's political, cultural and legal journey on human rights, which the Union places at the centre of its policies, its actions and its personality."
"In this respect, we think it is of the utmost importance for the European Union to have already begun the process, in order to be able to sign the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms when the time comes."
"This means, among other things, accepting the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights, and increasing the guarantees for citizens."
"It also means, so to speak, that in some way the different legislation on human rights and freedoms that coexists in Europe will be brought closer together: the national legislation - the guarantees that exist in each of the European countries, which are democratic countries that respect and defend human rights - the European Union legislation and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which is another piece of legislation that not only the Member States of the European Union, but other European countries are parties too, even if they are not part of the Union."
"We are therefore seeing a process of convergence of these pieces of legislation and the expression of this will be the European Union signing the Convention."
"On 17 March the Commission presented a recommendation to enter into negotiations for the Union to sign up to the Convention."
"From that time, the Council has done everything possible to speed up the debates on the negotiation mandate."
"There is a working group in the Council which is conducting the debates in close partnership with the European Commission."
"The Council has very much taken into consideration all the mandates in Protocol 8, which is the legal point of reference in this respect, for example: the Union's possible participation in the control bodies of the European Convention and the need to respect the competences of the Union and the powers of the institutions."
"It has also considered the need to appoint a European Union judge to the Court, the participation of this Parliament in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the participation of the Union in the Committee of Ministers when it exercises functions relating to the application of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The Council has also very closely followed the debates and hearings held by Parliament in March of this year, and is very much taking into account the opinions expressed by Parliament in the draft report drawn up by RamÃ³n JÃ¡uregui Atondo, Kinga GÃ¡l and Cristian Dan Preda."
"The Spanish Presidency's prediction, and the Council's position, is that the mandate to negotiate with the European Council, which will take time and is technical and complex in nature, will be adopted before the end of the first half of 2010."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, my colleague Olli Rehn has already expressed the position and the condolences of the Commission concerning the Greek disaster, so let me just look at how we can advance with our work because this will be of the utmost importance for completing the system of protection of fundamental rights within the Union, and the accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, is not an option."
"It is a destination, as the Presidency so well expressed it just now, but this accession is only one of the four elements of a very ambitious and comprehensive fundamental rights policy at the level of the European Union."
"First of all, with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding, and this legally binding charter is the most modern qualification of fundamental rights in the world in terms of political commitment for fundamental rights, of legibility and of legal certainty, and it entrenches all the rights found in the Convention."
"The meaning and scope of these rights are the same as those laid down by the Convention, but the Charter goes further."
"In it we find, for example, the so-called third generation of fundamental rights: data protection, guarantees on bioethics, on good and transparent administration."
"The level of protection provided by the Charter must always be at least as high as that of the Convention."
"In many cases it goes beyond."
"Secondly, there is the promotion of fundamental rights as a priority of the Stockholm Programme, setting the strategic guidelines for developing an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe."
"Thirdly, there is the creation of a new portfolio - justice, fundamental rights and citizenship - which shows how much importance the Commission attaches to strengthening the action of the Commission in this area."
"Then, fourthly, the accession of the EU to the Convention."
"It will guarantee that any person claiming to be a victim of a violation of the Convention by an institution or by a body of the Union is able to bring a complaint against the Union before the Strasbourg Court under the same conditions as those applying to complaints brought against Member States."
"In political terms accession means that the European Union reaffirms the pivotal role played by the Convention's system for the protection of human rights in Europe - in an enlarged Europe, not only in the European Union - but by acceding to this Convention the European Union puts its weight behind the Strasbourg system, and this is a system of external judicial control in the area of fundamental rights because now we are submitting our legal order fully and formally to that control."
