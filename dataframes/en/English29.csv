"It is not easy to pursue apparently conflicting goals in a balanced way, but this is the challenge of the present times."
"The third issue is the 'political' contribution that Europe can make to the fight against terrorism which has been occupying all the major democracies since 11 September."
"I call, in particular, for the reinvigoration of the Mediterranean policy and for peace initiatives in the Middle East. Spain has, on many occasions, been at the forefront of action addressing these issues."
"Lastly, I support the pledge made by Mr Aznar regarding Argentina, a country afflicted by a crisis which is threatening democracy itself and which could exacerbate the difficult situations of other Latin American countries."
"Mr President, as the last speaker, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for having remained present in the Chamber for the entire debate."
"In this speech, which will be brief, I should also like, first of all, to express my personal satisfaction at the presence in the Chamber today of the President of the Spanish government, José María Aznar, who, long before the events of 11 September had already made the defence of freedom and the fight against those who seek to curb it, such as terrorist murderers, one of the leitmotivs of his political approach."
"The results of this political action at European level could not be more heartening."
"Secondly, the Union' s immigration policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, requires your drive and your sensitivity towards such a burning issue, which is, I note, one of the Presidency' s objectives."
"I refer, for example, to the undeniable need to give a boost to Community legislation regulating aspects as important as family reunification, asylum procedure, or reception conditions for asylum seekers, in order to achieve a proper organisation of migratory flows, which effectively combats people trafficking in human need and who are responsible for the tragic deaths that are taking place in some parts of European territory, such as the Andalusian and other Spanish coastlines."
"Before I call the next speaker I ask colleagues in the House to take their seats so that we can listen with some parliamentary dignity to the reply of the presidency."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I thank you for all of the speeches you have made during this sitting, which I have listened to with the greatest interest."
"I wish to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that, of course, I share many of the aspirations that you have expressed here today."
"I also share many of your concerns but nor should it come as a surprise to anybody that I do not fully agree with some of what I have heard."
"I must of course, say, however, that, in general terms, I have the feeling that the basic elements of the issues, the objectives and the hopes that we, the various institutions and Europe' s citizens in general share are or can, quite reasonably, be promoted for the future, when it comes to putting our ideas and our plans into practice."
"I should like, first of all, to emphasise the importance of institutional dialogue and, within institutional dialogue, once again emphasise my commitment."
"We will have the opportunity to speak about this European impetus and also about the work of the Spanish Presidency, both in March, following the Barcelona European Council, and in June, following the Seville European Council."
"This is not, of course, to undermine the importance of the appearances by various members of the Spanish government at the various parliamentary bodies of this institution."
"I must tell you that, as holder of the Presidency, I see no problem in establishing what some of you have requested: the creation of a working group for interinstitutional dialogue that encompasses the Council, Parliament and the Commission and which will enable us to see clearly how best our work can be carried out."
"I do not think that the Commission has any problem with this either."
"Therefore, from this point of view, I am aware of, and agree with some of your concerns, such as the processing of documents concerning the second and third pillars, which must be resolved with all the guarantees required by the circumstances, the facts themselves and by the sensitivity of the matter, as is done in many national parliaments, with guarantees of security and of confidentiality."
"We can clearly make progress on many of these issues and, therefore, the Presidency will not raise any opposition to the creation of this interinstitutional working group."
"I should like to focus my speech, if I may, on the Presidency' s objectives and work programme and on no other matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an extremely important opportunity for the European Union, at an historic juncture, which is of great significance."
"In my opinion, we have before us an opportunity of which we must not fail to take advantage."
"This opportunity is evident in various situations."
"The entire world situation has changed following 11 September and in a tragic fashion."
"The priority in the world today is security and the fight against terrorism."
"The change that has taken place since 11 September is causing fundamental strategic changes in the world that will define the world of tomorrow, on which the European institutions must reflect, maintain dialogue and on which they must adopt a position for the future."
"The European Union as such, through its various institutions, cannot remain on the sidelines of the important debate and participation in the profound strategic changes that the world will be seeing."
"Secondly, this is a very important opportunity from the economic point of view."
"I say this for various reasons."
"Firstly, because for the first time we have the euro, our single currency, which is a guarantee of stability and which has been a great success."
"Secondly, because for structural reasons, to which I shall refer later, our economies need to continue putting their faith in major reforms."
"Thirdly, because we are going through a period of economic slowdown and unless we can take advantage of the introduction of the euro, providing impetus for economic reforms, we will be wasting an opportunity to help our economies to recover, which is, of course, extremely important."
"The third aspect that must be emphasised is that we are close to concluding a process which has, of course, a huge scope, that we might call enlargement, expansion or whatever we want; but which is, ultimately, the great political process of European unification."
"This is the objective that would, in itself, of course, fulfil the ambitions of a political generation that is able to look back on European history and which is concerned about planning and organising our future in a reasonable way."
"Lastly, we are aware that we must undertake a reform of the institutions, and we have, for this purpose, proposed the Convention and an Intergovernmental Conference."
"All of these ambitions provide us with a crucial opportunity."
"I wish to convey to the European Parliament the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to share ambitions and, at the same time, to work coherently to achieve our objectives more effectively."
"This is why we have set out various priorities, on which, in response to your speeches, I should like to briefly comment."
"First of all, with regard to the fight against terrorism, this is no longer a problem affecting only some people, but one that affects all of us, a problem to which some could show greater commitment, but it is quite clearly the responsibility of everyone."
"Of course, I appreciate, as I have said, the work and the efforts that the European Parliament has devoted to this matter."
"Of course, we have to consider the fight against terrorism not only in itself but also in relation to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, and to the Tampere commitments that are part of this more integrated Europe that we wish to build for the future."
"Various speakers, in particular Mr Poettering, have called for us to be resolute in the fight against terrorism."
"They are right."
"We must ask ourselves if in general terms, the European Union is capable at this historic juncture of dealing with the task in hand."
"I would say that it is reasonably capable, that the European arrest and surrender warrant - supported, of course, by all Fifteen Member States of the Union - the fight against the funding of terrorist organisations and the definition of a list of groups of organisations and persons that support terrorism are extraordinary steps."
"It is my fervent hope that in its sitting of 5 February, the European Parliament will also take a definitive step in this direction."
"How can this be done?"
"This must be done on the basis of the guarantees provided by the Rule of Law."
"You are quite right, ladies and gentlemen, in saying that the Rule of Law and our freedoms must be fully guaranteed."
"It is also true, and it should not be forgotten at this time that this is exactly what safeguards democracies and that this is exactly what these people wish to destroy and what those who dedicate themselves to carrying out or supporting terrorism wish to put an end to."
"Maintaining democracy through the Rule of Law is precisely, of course, our best guarantee."
"There cannot be - and indeed there are none - half-way houses in the fight against terrorism, because there are no half-way houses between life and death, between legality and lawlessness, between respect for the law and complicity with terrorism."
"What there must be is a clear defence, when necessary, from an international point of view, by means of an international coalition, and, when necessary, with the domestic commitment or with the international cooperation of all, to ensure that our freedoms and our Rule of law triumph."
"And in order to achieve this, we have to work, from an operational perspective, on issues of security, intelligence, cooperation between police forces, joint investigation teams and also on the common judicial issues that are a crucial part of the process of European integration."
"Furthermore, if we are coherent and consider terrorism to be one of the greatest threats currently facing our civilisation, we will have to include terrorism as an objective in the definition of the European Union' s security and defence policy."
"I think that this is a very important aspect and warrants very special treatment, at least in two chapters of relations that are highly relevant to the European Union: the first concerns the United States, with whom we also have discuss legal and criminal matters, whilst at the same time, of course, respecting our extradition system and maintaining our position of clear opposition to the death penalty, or of support for the jurisdiction of the courts and for all the sentences that can be handed down to an individual."
"But we have to discuss such matters."
"We also have to discuss matters in order to reach conclusions on some of your concerns about the importance of cooperation with Russia in the fight against terrorism."
"I am sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister."
"Colleagues, I really must insist that you take your places quietly."
"I ask the ushers to approach any Members who are having conversations and ask them to sit or to leave."
"We cannot work in intolerable parliamentary conditions on an occasion such as this!"
"Mr President, I wish to tell you that, in this context, we can move ahead with the creation of the International Criminal Court, with improving the instruments of international legal security."
"But in this chapter in the fight against terrorism I would like to conclude by making one thing quite clear: let us never forget - I know that the vast majority of this House has not forgotten - the moral lesson which these victims have taught us and let us never lose sight of our fundamental responsibilities."
"Failing to condemn terrorism and yet talking about 'dialogue' , supporting terrorism and yet talking about 'dialogue' , murdering and yet talking about 'dialogue' , apart from being a mistake, is an insult to common sense and to the memory of those individuals who have given their lives or who risk their lives precisely to protect human rights, freedom, the Rule of Law and democracy, especially in certain countries."
"The second issue I should like to highlight, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that the euro is a European success and perhaps, therefore, we can discuss, amongst ourselves, a more or less exhaustive list of names of people who could be key players or who deserve to be recognised on the euro."
"Above all, however, this is clearly a success for Europe, for European society, for its institutions and for Europe' s citizens."
"It is a success for those who conceived of the idea and who promoted it, for those who saw it through, for those who put it into practice and, above all, it is a success for the future of Europe."
"I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that the euro is not a point of arrival, but a point of departure, so that having cleaned up our economies in Europe - a process which we must maintain and continue - we must preserve the ambition of the Lisbon strategy, which is a Europe of full employment, a Europe that is more competitive and better equipped, in terms of people' s well-being, to face our future options in the world."
"This is clearly the path we need to take."
"This is why linking the introduction of the euro to the process of economic reform and situating this within the scope of the Barcelona European Council is absolutely crucial for Europe."
"I should like to briefly remind you all of some figures."
"In the 1990s, the United States of America experienced growth every year, except one, of more than 3%."
"In the 1990s, the European Union experienced growth every year, except one, of less than 3%."
"As I mentioned in my opening speech, the European Union has fallen behind the United States by six income points."
"As I said, the capacity for technological renewal in the United States and for European investment in North America, which has been better received there than in the countries of Europe, has caused a deep-seated crisis in Europe' s economies."
"I think that we would be making a mistake if we did not realise that there are structural factors, in addition to those resulting from the current economic crisis, that warrant our attention."
"This is why Barcelona, at this juncture, now that the euro has been introduced, represents an absolutely crucial challenge."
"A challenge to do what?"
"The challenge to realise the objective of full employment."
"If I may be allowed to put it this way, I am one of those who still believes that the best social policy, the best policy with which we can show solidarity and also the policy of common sense is the one that enables us to create employment and boost economic growth and which, therefore, helps societies to prosper and to be fairer, more equitable and to show greater solidarity."
"(Applause) This is exactly the issue at stake."
"This is why we are discussing transport, energy and the financial plan."
"I hope that the Commission and Parliament are able to effectively resolve their recent differences and set out the financial action plan."
"This is why we are discussing education and employment."
"This is the method we must use to work towards a Europe of greater competitiveness and progress."
"Unless we do so - and I am here giving you my personal opinion - we will see an economic recovery in the United States which will provide that country with many advantages over Europe in terms of competition and in terms of employment and the economy."
"This is something that no-one should confuse with the significance of not maintaining or of questioning the European social model."
"The only way in which we can preserve the European social model is by making it sustainable, viable and fundable, and this is achieved through growth and employment, which are, of course, the approaches that we have to support."
"(Applause)"
"I have already referred to my solid commitment to enlargement."
"On this point, I shall mention three specific issues."
"Enlargement can, and should, take place and we must work to ensure that this objective is achieved on 31 December of this year."
"There are three basic conditions that must be fulfilled: First of all, the principle of differentiation: it must be the candidate countries which are ready that are allowed to join."
"Secondly, respect for the Community acquis: the Community acquis cannot be questioned if we want enlargement to be achieved within the deadlines that have been set; and thirdly, respect for Agenda 2000, for the commitments given in Berlin, which contain and explain the basic elements of enlargement."
"If these three pillars are respected, the negotiating chapters and the common positions will lead to the historical process of enlargement."
"Reforms will have to be carried out and decisions taken in the immediate future, but we will have made a major contribution to the great political process of enlargement."
"In this regard, I should like to refer to an issue that is closely linked to this: the establishment of the Convention, institutional reforms and the idea of more Europe."
"I, ladies and gentlemen, believe in an integrated and diverse Europe."
"I understand that there may be some people who feel that more Europe, that a more integrated Europe will put an end to the current legal and political situation or to national States as we know them."
"This will not happen and the integrated Europe that has brought us this far is something history has never seen before, which represents a great success and is something that we must be able to preserve in all its diversity."
"Furthermore, each national State will be responsible for democratically arranging its distribution of competences between the national State, between communities or regions and between local authorities."
"The European Union, a fellowship of States, will be responsible for providing the means of participation, but let us not confuse points of view or possibilities, and let us not institutionally change something that has provided Europe with guarantees of security, prosperity, freedom and economic success."
"From this moment on, the Convention will have to undertake its work under the terms that have been agreed and the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 will have to undertake its own by representing the Member States."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I shall refer briefly to issues concerning external and common security policy."
"I wish to say that once European defence policy has been declared viable, the development of the second pillar is absolutely fundamental."
"I agree with the honourable Member who said that appropriate operational agreements could be concluded with the North Atlantic Alliance."
"It is absolutely crucial that these agreements are concluded in a Europe of security and defence that does not, in reality, exist and whose absence we complain about on a daily basis."
"I hope that the Member States which have greater responsibility for facilitating these agreements are sensible enough to do so in the near future."
"We must and we can assume more responsibilities in the field of security and, naturally, this is also one of the most significant challenges we face for the future."
"In terms of potential basic strategic elements of priorities, I mentioned, although I shall not dwell on this, the United States and Russia."
"I should like to express my conviction, ladies and gentlemen, that this dialogue with those two countries will determine a large part of the future of our fellow Europeans."
"Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, we shall have many important issues to discuss, one of which is the Mediterranean dialogue."
"This is not simply something that the Spanish Presidency wishes to promote but a vital European need in the Europe of the euro and in the Europe of enlargement."
"So I do not continue much longer and with my apologies, Mr President, I shall mention only one fact, because the terms 'solidarity' and 'development' have been mentioned on more than one occasion."
"If the countries of the southern shores of the Mediterranean wish to maintain their current levels of unemployment and resources, they will have to have created 40 million jobs within ten years."
"This is a considerable challenge from the point of view of the demographic rate and of the economic situation of the countries of the southern Mediterranean."
"It is an absolutely crucial challenge for all European countries and we would do well to think vary carefully about what we can do to respond to these challenges."
"I would say that Latin America - the second European Union, Latin America and Caribbean Summit will be held in Madrid; the first was held in Rio de Janeiro - must be a strategic priority for the European Union and is also important for development and for world stability."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these were the observations I wished to make at the first appearance of the Spanish Presidency in this House."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council."
"I note your willingness to come before the House after the Barcelona Summit, which we believe is an important additional moment for dialogue between our institutions."
"Vote"
"The next item is the vote."
"Proposal for a Decision (B5-0032/2002) pursuant to Rule 150(1) of the Rules of Procedure by the following Members: Poettering, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Barón Crespo, on behalf of the PSE Group, Cox, on behalf of the ELDR Group, Cohn-Bendit, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Wurtz, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, Bonde, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the numerical strength of committees."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Proposal for a Decision by the Conference of Presidents (B5-0021/2002) pursuant to Rule 150(2) of the Rules of Procedure on the setting up a temporary committee on foot-and-mouth disease."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Report (A5-0463/2001) by Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on general aspects of consumer protection policy and more particularly consumer information and education in connection with the application of Directive 90/314/EC (2001/2136(INI))."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Recommendation for second reading: - on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a Community Action Programme promoting non-governmental organisations primarily active in the field of environmental protection (13397/1/2001 - C5-0643/2001 - 2001/0139(COD))."
"(Parliament approved the common position)"
"Report (A5-0462/2001) by Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision relating to the conclusion, on behalf of the Community, of the Protocol on Water and Health to the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (COM(2001) 483 - C5-0644/2001 - 2001/0188(CNS))."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"- Temporary committee on foot-and-mouth disease"
". I tried to tell the House that, as some colleagues know, almost all my livestock contracted foot-and-mouth disease and were slaughtered."
"However, since I do not consider the proposed Committee of Inquiry will affect me financially, I voted in favour of the inquiry."
"Election of Quaestors of Parliament"
"The next item is the second round of the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament."
"Voting: 570, valid votes: 567."
"Majority: 284."
"Mr Poos: 304 - elected"
"Mr Balfe: 288 - elected"
"Mrs Smet: 288 - elected"
"Mr Marinho: 264"
"Mrs Maes: 116."
"No further votes are required."
"We have filled all five positions for Quaestor."
"I congratulate all the individuals who have been elected."
"I invite you to a brief reception."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.24 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"I should like to inform the House that our colleague in the Socialist Group, Mr John Hume, will have the distinction in the near future of being awarded the Mahatma Ghandi Peace Prize by the Indian Government."
"The recipient last year of this new prize was Mr Nelson Mandela."
"Given his outstanding record of commitment to peace and reconciliation in Ireland, I am very pleased to congratulate him."
"I am sure the House will be very proud of this recognition of one of our most distinguished Members."
"Welcome"
"The Delegation for Relations with Russia is today being honoured with a visit by our Russian colleagues, including Mr Vladimir Lukin."
"I see that Vladimir, who is an old friend of mine, is upstairs already."
"You are very welcome, Vladimir."
"He is Deputy Chairman of the Russian State Duma and Co-Chairman of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"It is wonderful to see you here, and I hope we can meet personally."
"I should not say these things from the chair. Vladimir, I have only been learning how to be a chairman here since yesterday but it is good to see old friends come to the House."
"Introduction of the euro"
"The next item is the debate on the introduction of the euro, which we have now had in our pockets for some weeks and which is the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream in the European Community."
"It has been a wonderful tribute to the capacity of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks; it has been a wonderful tribute to the banking and financial and commercial system and the retailing system; and, most of all, a wonderful tribute to European citizens, who have taken to it with such alacrity, that now it has virtually displaced the currencies in the relevant Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, almost ten years after the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht, the euro has now found its way into our pockets and, I think, into the hearts of our fellow citizens."
"The operations to introduce the euro that have taken place in these first two weeks have gone extraordinarily well."
"Our most optimistic expectations have been more than satisfied."
"Europe' s citizens have acted enthusiastically and responsibly, and all the operators involved in the changeover have shown themselves to be dedicated and meticulous."
"The entry into circulation of the euro on 1 January 2002 is the culmination of a project on which we have been working for many years."
"Our fellow citizens feel that European integration is making very slow progress."
"Taking the historical view, however, we can see that it is actually moving ahead at great speed."
"The Member States took ten centuries to achieve monetary unification in their territories and the Community has done the same in little more than 40 years."
"To start with, I should like to pay tribute to the men and women who made the success of this project possible."
"There are many, and mention has been made this morning of some of them."
"I am not going to repeat their names, which are fresh in everyone' s mind, but the project has - if I may put it this way - not only fathers but also mothers, and I should like to make specific mention of these women by referring to one individual: Christa Randzio-Plath, who embodies the involvement and the commitment to the euro of this Parliament and of her Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"It would be unfair, however, if I did not mention two other Members of this Parliament: Karl von Wogau, who, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, also played a critical role, and the previous President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer."
"I should also like to mention my predecessor, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who played a crucial role in the previous legislature."
"We have worked effectively together with Parliament and I hope that we can continue to do so when confronting new challenges in the task ahead of us."
"This is why I should like to say that the introduction of euro notes and coins is not only the culmination of a project."
"It is also the beginning of a new era in the history of European integration."
"The physical reality of the euro affords us the opportunity to make further progress in the process of integration."
"I shall refer to this later on and I should like to focus now on more critical aspects of these early days of the changeover."
"First of all, I should like to highlight the enthusiasm of Europe' s citizens towards their new currency."
"This has undoubtedly been a crucial factor in the success of the operation."
"The citizens of Europe have rapidly integrated the euro into their daily lives."
"Before of the first of January, the sale of currency kits had already been a success."
"From the first of January, consumers began using notes on a massive scale."
"The volumes of withdrawals from ATMs were higher than expected from the first days onwards."
"The amount of business taking place at bank counters was so great during the first week of January that, in some countries, the volume of withdrawals or exchanges in banks was greater than the volume of operations at ATMs."
"Another indicator of the success of the single currency amongst the public has been the rapid progress of payments in euros."
"These had already reached 20% on 2 January, the first working day."
"Today - that is to say, only nine days later - nine out of ten payments are being made in euros."
"The operation has been a success, therefore, given that over 90% of these transactions are taking place in euros after two weeks."
"My second comment on the adaptation of automatic cash machines is that this has also been swift and has taken place throughout the euro zone."
"For the last two years, the Commission and the European Central Bank have asked banks to change their plans and adapt ATMs with almost immediate effect."
"This course of action has been a success."
"On average, 80% of ATMs were adapted by the first of January."
"This figure rose to 90% by 2 January and to 97% by 3 January."
"By 4 January, almost all ATMs were only issuing euros."
"A comment on business: the majority of citizens have sought primarily to get rid of their national currencies and receive change in euros, thereby demonstrating their desire to use only the euro as quickly as possible."
"By and large, businesses respected their commitment to give change in euros, which enabled the existing stock of the former currencies to be disposed of rapidly."
"The acceleration of payments in euros together with the exceptional measures adopted by the majority of businesses meant that queues in shops were not as long as they could have been."
"Saturday 5 January was the key day for this issue."
"The test was conclusive and in all participating States, queues were of normal length."
"This situation did not change on the following Monday, when sales began in many European countries."
"Nevertheless, the first week of January was extremely complicated for business."
"On the one hand, the frontloading of businesses turned out to be inadequate or encountered logistical problems in some Member States."
"On the other hand, many consumers spent money in order to get rid of high denomination notes from the national currency, which soon created problems with the supply of lower-value notes in a number of the States participating in the operation, a situation that was resolved by one means or another."
"With regard to the behaviour of prices, an issue to which the Commission decided to draw the attention of the Member States and all players in the changeover in the months leading up to the first of January, I can tell you that, according to the reports submitted to us by the national authorities responsible, there has been no significant increases in prices as a consequence of the changeover to the euro, with the exception of a few isolated incidents."
"Furthermore, in some cases there have been downward adjustments, although, it is also fair to say, in other cases and on an individual basis, the opposite may have occurred."
"Overall - I repeat - there has been no significant increase in prices and we do not, therefore, expect to see a negative impact on inflation for the month of January."
"In conclusion, the balance sheet for these two first weeks is, in the opinion of the Commission, very positive."
"The greatest exchange operation in history has taken place practically without mishap."
"It is a huge triumph for the Union and proof of the high quality of our meticulous preparations."
"The efforts of all key players in the transition to the euro: the eurosystem, national governments, the Commission, private operators and all citizens have borne fruit."
"The success of the introduction of the euro is the end of a chapter - as I said before - but not the end of the work."
"We must now harvest the fruits of this success by increasing and deepening the coordination of our economic policies and by undertaking the structural reforms necessary to increase growth and employment in the Union."
"We must now apply the same energy and ambition that have guided the introduction of the euro to achieving the coordination of economic policies which will enable us to increase growth and employment."
"In the short term, the framework of stability in the euro zone has enabled us to provide a balanced and timely response to the economic slowdown we are currently experiencing."
"The clear improvement in budget revenues has created some leeway, which will help to cushion the impact of the slight increase in budget deficits that have appeared as a result of the global slowdown."
"In 2002 we hope to regain a satisfactory level of growth, which will contribute to global economic recovery."
"The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins will, by eliminating uncertainty, assist this recovery, stimulating consumer and business confidence."
"In the medium term, the European Union set itself clear objectives in Lisbon for increasing the potential for growth and for job creation."
"In order to achieve these objectives, it is important that we maintain the impetus that will enable us to carry out the necessary reforms which will, in turn, bring about an increase in the rates of employment and productivity."
"For this year, the Commission proposes three priority areas: first of all employment policies and, in particular, active labour market policies; secondly, economic reforms to increase competitiveness, integration and investment in key industries; and thirdly, investing in knowledge to increase competitiveness and employment."
"I shall not dwell any longer on these points, which were yesterday the subject of the speech by the President of the Commission."
"Greater interdependence of the economies of the Member States, and in particular within the euro zone, calls for closer and more effective coordination of these economic policies."
"In this context, I would say that coordination must be strengthened on the basis of a more accurate analysis of the economic situation and the policy mix of the euro zone."
"There must be greater openness in reaching consensus on appropriate policies and the Member States and the Commission must be given access to information on the principal measures of economic policy that each country will adopt in future so that the peer review system that we have within the Community can function effectively."
"Moving ahead means meeting our commitments: those in the Treaty and those in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Moving ahead also means facing up to new challenges."
"This is what we, as the Commission, will be focussing our efforts and our work on and we hope we will be able to count on the cooperation of Parliament that we have always enjoyed, and with which we hope to continue working in the same efficient and consensual way that we have in the past."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"As you remarked, many were referred to and thanked earlier today."
"Of course we should thank you and your staff and the College of Commissioners now for all the work you have done in the past several years to bring this to a reality."
"You have our congratulations and respect for doing that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this speech is the last I shall deliver in this Chamber as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I have been a member of this Committee for 22 years."
"From tomorrow, I shall be a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I am convinced that the next step on the road to the realisation of the European Union must be political union."
"I look forward to working on this task in future."
"Looking back over these years, I would like to start by recalling our colleague Basil de Ferranti, now sadly deceased, who at that time drafted the first reports on the creation of the internal market and thereby initiated this whole development."
"It started off as a working party on technical barriers to trade, later spawning the Kangaroo Group."
"These were the first initiatives towards creating the internal market."
"Jacques Delors was at that time the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in other words, Mrs Randzio-Plath, our predecessor; he then, as French Finance Minister and later as President of the European Commission, laid the foundations on which these ideas were to become realities."
"I wish also to recall Jacques Moreau who, together with me back then in 1984, presented the first report of the European Parliament on proposals for the creation of the internal market."
"Seeing the enthusiasm that greeted the euro on 1 January, welcoming this new currency for 300 million people in the European Union, we have to recall, on the one hand, how difficult was the road to this."
"On the other hand, though, we also have to ask ourselves what conditions are required for the euro, our common currency, to be successful in the long term?"
"Let me here list three conditions."
"The first is the consistent development of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is indeed almost ironic that we see today that it was Germany, my homeland, that campaigned most vigorously then for this Stability and Growth Pact with its strict criteria, and that one can, or must, almost take it for granted in the present situation that Germany will be the first country to be affected by this treaty's sanctions."
"I take the view, though, that we must be consistent here if we want the euro to become and remain a stable currency in the long term and interest rates in the European Union to remain low in the long term for our enterprises, as a condition of investment and growth."
"The second condition is that, in the Member States and in the EU, we make economic policy in accordance with principles held in common."
"It was by a large majority the will of Parliament that these principles should be those of the social market economy."
"Thirdly, we must move forward to political union."
"We said before Maastricht that we wanted monetary union and political union at the same time."
"Even then we were saying that monetary union cannot exist in the long term without political union."
"We must stay consistent on this point."
"It is now that we must take these steps to political union, at the core of which is a common foreign and security policy."
"I would like, finally, to pick up on something Jacques Delors said."
"Jacques Delors, during the interminable debates we had on the European internal market, once remarked, and quite rightly, that you could not fall in love with an internal market."
"In other words, there is very little emotion involved."
"I would also say that the same applies to a currency, although there are some of us who have a very emotional, almost erotic, relationship with the currency."
"What we need, though, and what we must bring to light, is the awareness of a common European identity, Europe-consciousness."
"I believe that is surely the most important task facing us as the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the introduction of euro notes and coins has not only been a success in logistical and organisational terms, but is also already contributing to the enhanced creation and discovery of a European identity."
"Not even Eurosceptics in Italy can do anything about that."
"The tangible euro makes Europe a fact of daily life, just as we MEPs always said it would."
"The euro was, in a manner of speaking, Parliament's first choice since it was itself directly elected, a choice above all by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs To that extent, the euro has for two decades been one of Parliament's successful projects."
"We took our stand for a market and a currency and played our part in creating them."
"I think that thanks are owed to all the Members of this House, and to you too, Mr von Wogau."
"(Applause)"
"'Euro' will in my view become the affirmative word of 2002."
"After all, the euro embodies Europe's dynamism and determination to create a European identity, improve European competitiveness for the benefit of the economy and employment and grow together into permanent mutual solidarity."
"Monetary union completes the internal market - the right answer to the challenges of globalisation - and makes it at last work for everyone, for small and medium-sized enterprises and above all for people."
"The euro will become a success because it is accepted not only by the markets but also by people."
"Many are at last rejoicing - as we Members always predicted they would - to be living in Euroland."
"The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins fills everyone with enthusiasm and creates the climate of optimism that we in Europe urgently need for investment, stimulation of internal demand and thus for employment."
"The introduction of euro notes and coins crowns and rewards the sustained efforts on the road towards monetary union."
"Today, many people are already wondering why euro notes and coins had not been introduced much earlier, something we Members had always demanded."
"We call upon Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain to come into the eurozone in their own interest before eastward enlargement takes place."
"The German mark was a currency with a proud past."
"Three years of monetary union promise us an equally stable monetary future."
"There have in any case been lower interest rates under monetary union than in the decades of the German mark that preceded it."
"This is connected with the low level of interest, which guarantees good financial conditions that favour investment."
"It follows that monetary union has kept to what was promised politically in the Maastricht Treaty, namely price stability."
"The introduction of euro notes and coins, then, also brings visible successes for consumers: prices for consumer durables, such as cars, will fall."
"By its completion of the internal market programme, the euro also at last makes possible consumer-friendly competition, which will lead to medium-term pressure on prices and an incentive to higher quality."
"The completion of economic and monetary union, of the internal reform of the European Union and of a European constitution and the successful eastward enlargement of the EU are the great challenges that Europe must face up to."
"There is one thing, though, that we must not forget: the euro is not only a monetary project; it was always a political project and is a component of the political union of Europe."
"Europe is small in global terms, and so the internal market, completed by monetary union, is quite certainly the right answer."
"The euro, moreover, puts to the test the ability of Europeans to organise unity in the interests of all Europe's states."
"As far as further bold European projects are concerned, it is both a connecting link between them and a stumbling block."
"William Shakespeare was right to maintain that 'if money go before, all ways do lie open' ."
"It is to be hoped that that applies also to more efficient and improved coordination of economic, financial, employment and social security policies."
"The euro urgently needs to be accompanied by some sort of economic government."
"Cyclic developments are no longer triggered by nation states, but by economic issues, and so the EU summit in Barcelona has been required to exchange dogmatism in handling the Stability and Growth Pact, which does leave some room to manoeuvre, for a sound policy which is committed to monetary, financial and also social stability."
"Our commitment as a Parliament to monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank was particularly important."
"We took our stand in Parliament for the independence of the European Central Bank, but also demonstrated our commitment to that institution's democratic accountability."
"Hence it is very important that we should have organised and motivated a cultural revolution in Europe, for the Member States' dealings with the national central banks used not to have the democratic accountability we have now."
"Money policy thus becomes transparent and comprehensible and helps us to fathom this mystery as well."
"For money policy is not neutral; it too has an influence on the real economy, on growth and employment."
"Mr President, my group has decided that the coordinators in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism must be elected at 3.30 p.m."
"Since I am one of the candidates, my presence there will be required."
"Could I ask whether Mr Pronk could read out my two-minute speech in my place when my name appears on screen?"
"Mrs Peijs, I have no objection to that if it is acceptable to the House, which I think it is."
"So let us act on that basis."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I will speak on my own behalf."
"On 1 January, many European citizens made their first acquaintance with the new currency: the euro."
"And what an acquaintance that was."
"Barely two weeks have passed and the euro has replaced the national currencies everywhere."
"If Parliament' s wish to distribute euro notes among the public before 1 January had been complied with, a few smaller problems might have been avoided, but that is probably just a detail."
"I could not agree more that the changeover has been a runaway success."
"This is mainly due to the citizens of Europe, a fact to which you yourself have already made reference, as befits a good Liberal."
"They have reacted to the currency change with enthusiasm and patience."
"Shopkeepers should also be praised."
"They have borne the burden of the actual implementation and, in my view, they are therefore the heroes of the conversion."
"However, in my opinion, the introduction of the euro notes and coins is merely a first step, and Commissioner Solbes Mira has already made reference to this."
"What matters most now is to ensure that the new currency continues to be successful."
"This requires quite a bit from all participating countries: the political will to support the currency and not to cast it in a bad light, as some members of the Italian government have done, the political courage to leave the Stability Pact intact so that the correct financial framework of the euro continues to exist, and the political power to build on the success of the euro."
"The time has come therefore, following the most successful European project ever, to take steps in order to further develop the internal market."
"If we really want to achieve the objectives prescribed in Lisbon, we must commit ourselves to the further liberalisation of the internal market and to making it more flexible."
"There are five clear priorities in this respect, namely postal services, transport, electricity, gas and water."
"These are vital in the liberalised and flexible knowledge-based economy that we are pursuing in Europe, and also in the interests of the citizen."
"In this way, the citizens know where they stand with Europe."
"Only by choosing this option can the EU' s economic power be realised and the new currency kept strong."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the largely successful introduction of the euro notes and coins proves one thing and one thing alone: that the people of Europe are highly pragmatic."
"The markets, which always have the choice, appear to be much less enthusiastic."
"In any case, I believe that the people will use price levels as the true factor that determines whether or not they will adopt the Euroland currency."
"However, this currency, which does not belong to any one State, is now posing new problems."
"Shopkeepers have already had to carry out, free of charge, the work of the banks during the introduction of the euro."
"It is conceivable that, during this period, shopkeepers had the same interest as consumers in doing this."
"But now the problem of counterfeiting has surfaced."
"Forged notes are already at large and it is easy to envisage the different currencies of north and south Euroland intermingling this summer."
"For example, the EUR 200 and EUR 500 notes, which were not printed in France and in the countries of southern Europe, will reach us, which is in fact already happening with notes of German origin."
"Next summer, these notes will be everywhere."
"Obviously, shopkeepers are unable to identify potential forgeries which are worth, if you will forgive me for saying so, more than 3 500 of our poor old francs, in other words, half the minimum wage in France."
"The Commission will be responsible for compensating the victims and those misled by forged euro, since no State can be."
"But will the European citizens and the shopkeepers, who accept forged currency by mistake and because they are unable to tell the difference, be compensated by Member States or by the European Central Bank?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the euro is an undeniable success, and this is thanks to the European Central Bank, the Commission and all those who worked on the project, including the Members of Parliament."
"Mr von Wogau said that the next stage would be political union."
"I agree, but I feel it would be a mistake to think that the success of the euro, its capacity to be a strong, stable, reliable currency lies in political union, which is necessary for other reasons."
"The euro will be a strong currency if Europe' s economy is strong."
"Commissioner, you mentioned the need to coordinate economic policies several times in your speech."
"I feel that there is something which is even more important than coordinating economic policies, which, if we overdo it, could even have negative repercussions."
"It is important for there to be sound economic policies in Europe: the strength of the euro will depend on it."
"We must combine the transparent policies and get away from the present rigidity."
"The strength of the euro, then, will depend on the ability of these transparent policies to make the economic systems more dynamic - as Mr Maaten said - to free them from the constraints of corporatism and dirigisme, to liberalise the markets, etc."
"All this is often the result of too little rather than too much economic policy and, in this respect, I feel that the tension between policies, the competition between the many different solutions adopted by the countries is of benefit and, through a form of bona fide benchmarking, can foster positive processes of emulation."
"Although it does need some fine-tuning, the framework of the single market, together with the Stability Pact - an economic Constitution which many countries like Italy did indeed lack - is broad enough to be able to embrace, without conflict or contradiction, a transparent range of options between which it is left to the individual countries to decide."
"I believe that leaving the Member States the leeway to choose between options within the framework of the single market will lead to a stronger economy and that, as a result, the conditions necessary for a stronger single currency will emerge."
"Mr President, I am indeed reading the text of Mrs Peijs, and in order to emphasise this, I am standing in her place, but to remove any doubt you may have: I am totally behind it."
"The 'euro introduction' project has been a success."
"In the Netherlands and in Ireland, the introduction of the euro is practically completed."
"More than 90% of all payments are already conducted in euros."
"Mrs Peijs is proud - and I could not agree more - that European citizens have so quickly adopted the euro with such a great sense of innovation and have put their own currencies to one side."
"The Europeans did not need long changeover periods."
"Today, we undoubtedly owe a special word of thanks and recognition to the retail trade, which has absorbed a whole host of difficulties with appropriate flexibility."
"The banks and their staff have also contributed a great deal to the smooth transition."
"We must now take an important next step."
"The euro must remain a stable and strong currency."
"For that purpose, the President of the Central Bank must first and foremost remain where he is and must closely monitor the bank' s objectives, namely low inflation."
"It is almost more important for the Member States to start to realise that they are not on their own and are not fully autonomous, but that everything they do, and notably what they do not do, has a bearing on the entire Community and on the stability of the currency."
"In order to sustain the confidence of the markets, it is very important for the large Member States in particular - and perhaps notably Germany - at long last to take the necessary measures to open up their markets completely, to make their labour markets more flexible, to make their pension systems sustainable and to modernise their social benefits."
"Instead of being the Union' s driving force, these countries act more as a brake on the Union' s progress."
"Any weakness in the currency is down to the Member States and so far not to the Central Bank, which is operating exceptionally well, except in the field of payment balance systems, such as TARGET, and the consumer system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there are two aspects of the introduction of the euro which have been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes and other speakers: the undeniable success and future prospects of the euro."
"I will use the short amount of time available to me to concentrate on the second aspect, for the euro really is an open door to the future."
"Indeed, I feel that, in addition to its great symbolic significance, the introduction of the euro will not bring immediate short-term effects for our economy or in terms of the rate of inflation; however I do feel that it provides Europe with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a climate of stability, particularly as regards the medium and long term."
"In the medium term, Europe has the problem of how to disengage its economy from the US cycle."
"Indeed, still today, European development is heavily influenced by exports and, therefore, to a great extent by US demand."
"This being the case, the current recession in the United States could impact on us rather than be offset by our capacity for independent growth."
"This capacity for development of internal demand can benefit greatly from the integration of monetary policy, but it does not depend on this alone."
"It needs to be boosted by an economic policy which combines monetary policy with fiscal policy and, most importantly, with a policy of research and innovative investment such as that outlined at Lisbon, although this policy has not actually been pursued."
"The problem exists in the longer term of the euro as a potential world-wide reserve currency on an equal footing with the dollar."
"A Parliamentary resolution has already pointed out that the central guideline for the exchange policy should not be a strong or weak euro but a stable euro, varying, of course, within a range in a way that is not destabilising."
"To this end, it will be necessary, sooner or later, to promote some form of agreement between the US and European monetary policies for our mutual and shared benefit."
"It is true, then, that the euro does represent a major opportunity, but it is an opportunity which has not yet been exploited."
"This potential role - as the previous speakers have said too - must be fully realised by politics, by Europe' s political capacity, by a government responsible for the economy which promotes the conditions for autonomous development within Europe and which ensures effective management of exchange outside Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking with one voice through the Central Bank, the governments of the euro zone countries are stating and affirming that Europeans have given an enthusiastic, even euphoric welcome to the euro, the imperial currency, the new Reichsmark."
"According to official reports, no problems have marred its triumphant arrival."
"Fifteen days after the euro' s introduction, the evidence is for all to see: the great majority of transactions are being made in euro."
"To put it bluntly, these crude propaganda-driven reports are very wide of the mark."
"Nothing has really worked as planned."
"There was a shortage of euro in the first days, banks refused to do their work by refusing to carry out currency exchanges or by placing a limit on them, and, to top it all, by trying to charge for the transaction."
"Cash dispensers cannot issue EUR 20 notes, vending machines are refusing to accept euros produced in another country and the opportunities for counterfeiters are increasing because no one knows how to identify the new notes."
"We have to admit it: European citizens are not using the euro out of enthusiasm, but under duress because it is increasingly difficult to get hold of their national currency."
"Some Germans, for whom there is no transition period, are continuing to pay in deutschmarks even though this currency ceased to be legal tender on 1 January."
"There is no advantage, therefore, to using the euro for everyday purchases."
"It only causes difficulties and is costly to everyone, not to mention that its introduction has meant States have had to abandon their sovereignty unnecessarily."
"Everyone in Europe now has a foreign currency and we are also seeing a return to rising prices."
"Everyone realises, when doing their shopping, that prices are soaring, everywhere and in highly worrying proportions, particularly for everyday goods and essential items."
"This is perhaps not quite the same as the Ruhr of the 1920s but this is similar to what happened in the 1970s."
"January' s price index may be saved by the sales but let us wait for the figures for the whole year."
"Let us also wait for the first anti-social effects of competition, which the euro will have on salaries, relocations and redundancies, to be felt."
"Therefore, in the name of the right of nations to self-determination, we would like to affirm the right of nations to bring back their national currency, in the same way that the former Soviet states, when freed from the yoke of Soviet federalism, brought back theirs."
"Mr President, President Prodi told us this morning that the introduction of euro notes and coins was a huge success."
"And several Members have gone even further by speaking of the enthusiasm of consumers, who appear to have embraced the new currency."
"In our view, these comments are excessive."
"It is true that the changeover to euro notes and coins was well executed, technically speaking, but the consumers had no other choice than, sooner or later, to use the new money."
"The real test will be that of managing the euro in the years to come."
"And, in this respect, if I were a federalist, I would not be pleased."
"I would be rather concerned, because, today, the people who occupy a very difference position to us on the political stage, such as Jacques Delors, are saying exactly what we have always said, namely that the euro cannot function as it is."
"We should speed up integration, as Mr Prodi said."
"We should strengthen the economic pillar or move towards a political Europe, as other Members are saying."
"In short, we need more supranational power to integrate at European level; in other words, that Europe is turned into more of a super-State."
"There is the rub, Mr President."
"Is Europe prepared to accept this super-State?"
"No, it is not!"
"First of all, the nations of Europe are sufficiently diverse in every respect that it is not possible to create an optimal monetary zone."
"Some of our Members will certainly say that a super-State with the power to ensure consistency is all the more necessary."
"Yes, admittedly, it might be all the more necessary, but at the same time, it is all the more impossible."
"So this is the vicious circle in which the euro zone countries will struggle over the coming years."
"You could also say that it is a race against time."
"For the euro to work, either those who oversee it will fairly soon manage to pull apart the nations and build the super-State - and then the euro can survive, but what state will Europe and democracy be in? - or the nations, simply because of their differences, will make it impossible to manage the single currency."
"As for us, it is clear what we prefer, Mr President, out of an affection for our homelands and because of our belief in the fundamental need for a national framework for democracy and solidarity."
"Is there not a third option, however, that of a single currency without a State?"
"This could appeal to us, but no one actually knows how it would work if confronted with asymmetric shocks."
"Furthermore, the markets themselves do not believe in it, as proven by the persistent weakness of the euro in recent days."
"The euro, then, is launching us into an adventure with very serious political and financial consequences of which the citizens were not warned in advance and which they are not prepared to shoulder."
"It should really be the people who invented the euro who are concerned."
"Mr President, the launch of the notes and coins has finally made the euro a political reality for the 300 million people of Euroland."
"Coming from a country which is out, and a party which opposes joining, I was half expecting more glitches and popular resentment at the imposition of an unfamiliar currency."
"So far so good, with little inflationary rounding-up."
"I congratulate the ECB, the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting, although I still question the need for a EUR 500 note which can only facilitate criminality."
"The naturally cautious British Conservative position is that, although the euro may be an added convenience to travellers and improve price transparency in the single market, it is undoubtedly intended primarily to bolster pan-European identity as a stepping stone to further political integration - something admitted to by everybody bar Mr Blair and our Labour Government - and to control not only of monetary policy, but also of taxation."
"The ""one size fits all"" monetary policy, as the Commission's pessimistic 2001 economic report admits, cannot be right for all of the countries all of the time and, coupled with the fiscal restraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, imposes severe destabilising problems and a lack of flexibility on certain economies, as we have already seen in the artificial boom scenario of Ireland."
"The risks of an asymmetric shock developing will only get bigger after enlargement as European labour markets remain unreformed and largely immobile."
"President Prodi has admitted this inherent risk and the call will come very shortly for a much bigger EU budget and direct EU taxes to set up bail-out funds to compensate affected countries for their loss of rights to devalue their currencies or lower their interest rates."
"Nevertheless, I wish the euro well as the currency of our major trading partners, since UK prosperity is also affected by its stability."
"I hope that my pessimistic prognosis, which echoes that of the Commission's own, proves to be wrong over time."
"I would also like confirmation from Commissioner Solbes that, in his opinion, for the UK to join the euro it will have to spend at least two years locked into the ERM II phase first before proceeding."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your election."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank all the speakers for their comments."
"I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years."
"We are sorry to see him leave the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but we know that his skills will continue to help Parliament and the process of European integration in the Committee of Foreign Affairs."
"Karl von Wogau said, in a reference to Jacques Delors, that it is impossible to fall in love with the euro, and yet Christa Randzio-Plath said that Europe' s citizens are happy."
"Both comments might be linked to one fundamental factor: the euro is the first aspect of European identity to affect all citizens of the Member States of the Monetary Union."
"The euro is extremely important, as were the removal of borders or the internal market, which, nevertheless, only affect goods and citizens crossing the border at a given time, but it is also a piece of our European identity, which we use every day from morning till night, in all the countries of the Monetary Union and exactly in the same conditions."
"Because there are clearly also striking differences between us, this aspect, out of all our common aspects, must be highlighted as a very positive one, as the others have nothing to do with any form of unification."
"From now on, the euro will give us notes and coins and a slight increase in economic growth, as a consequence of uncertainties being eliminated."
"It is true, however, and I am in agreement on this with some of the speakers, that the fundamental elements will emerge as a result of our potential capacity for growth or, to put it another way, as a result of implementing the Lisbon process in a more ambitious way than we have done so far."
"We will be able to break free from the United States, as Mr Ruffolo suggests we would want to do."
"Nevertheless, experience and the year 2001 have shown us that being relatively independent in terms of trade does not protect us from the effects of a crisis in the United States as a consequence of the course which takes place due to the economic effects arising from the relationships between companies and between financial markets."
"The exchange rate will be the real test of the euro."
"I have always said that the exchange rate was never an objective of the Union' s policy."
"Our objective for monetary policy is to maintain low inflation and we are convinced that a currency with low inflation is, in the long term, a stable currency, a popular currency, a currency that will provide refuge and is a currency that will have an important role to play in the economic world."
"Apart from the purely economic aspects, however, what is happening with our institutional structure?"
"Is the euro the beginning of economic government?"
"I would say that the model we put together in Maastricht was based on a single monetary policy and on coordinated national economic policies."
"This is our model."
"And we have to work on ensuring that the euro is a success on this basis."
"I am not going to prejudge whether we should make more or less progress in the processes of political integration."
"It could be done according to the wishes of those that favour greater political integration, but I also realise that this is a decision to be taken by the fifteen Member States in other bodies, in other forums and following a different debate."
"Nevertheless, I am convinced that we can move ahead with the process of greater coordination between economic policies, which certainly does not mean the unification of our economic policies, because our situations are different and, consequently, policies must be applied consistently."
"Today, like so often before, we have tended to confuse stability pacts with economic policy guidelines."
"Is the Stability Pact the problem for the Union' s economic policy?"
"This is something we have discussed on more than one occasion in this House."
"I repeat what I have always said: the Stability Pact is nothing more and nothing less than a necessary factor which allows us to maintain a policy mix between budgetary policy and monetary policy, which facilitates a monetary policy with low rates of interest."
"Structural changes to our economies and the move towards growth, coherence between our national economic policies and Union policy as a whole with monetary policy must be managed by means of these broad economic policy guidelines."
"We have the necessary instruments; we have to perfect and improve them, but I think that the system is a good one."
"The policy mix will be one of the key elements of the Spanish Presidency, as the chairman of Ecofin stressed and I am sure we will have the opportunity in this House to debate this fundamental point."
"Of course, the structural reforms, as I said earlier, are still the key to the future."
"I wish to make a comment on enlargement of the euro zone."
"We have noted greater interest in the 'pre-in' countries in what is happening in our experience in the euro zone."
"Or rather, I would say that in the three 'pre-in' countries, considerable further interest has been aroused, which is reflected in some political attitudes that have been communicated or which we have seen in recent days."
"Admittedly, there are still some who criticise the euro and what some people in the Eurosceptic world are afraid of, since the short term problems have not occurred, is what will happen in ten or fifteen years' time."
"Obviously, there is nothing we can say on this point."
"It is difficult to control what will happen in ten or fifteen years' time, but I personally am convinced that by then we will have far fewer problems than we do at the moment in this regard."
"What conditions will be imposed on the 'pre-in' countries in order for them to join the Union?"
"Exactly the same as those imposed on the other countries, no more and no less."
"Compliance with the Maastricht criteria, with the additional factor of the opt-out clause to which Denmark and the United Kingdom have the right."
"There will be no change either for the 'pre-in' or for the candidate countries."
"We take the view that the equal treatment of all Member States of the Union is a fundamental principle, which we should not alter under any circumstances."
"A last comment on an issue that might be a minor one but which is, to a certain extent, the issue that has concerned us today: the practical problems involved in the introduction of the euro."
"Have businesses played the role of the bankers?"
"No, they have not."
"Through the system of frontloading, businesses have acted as an incentive for the rapid take-up of the single currency."
"It is true that some practical problems have occurred, due more to pressure by some citizens to use businesses as a bank, when they have tried to change high denominations of national currency in businesses and not in the banks, as should have been predicted."
"Have there been serious problems of counterfeiting?"
"There have been neither serious nor less serious problems in this area."
"So far, we have not seen counterfeits that could technically be called 'counterfeit euros' ."
"There have been photocopies."
"There have been euros produced with scanners, but which are enormously different from the real euro and, consequently, these concerns, which are occasionally expressed, should no longer be an issue."
"The euro has an extremely high security factor, unlike some of the world' s other national high circulation currencies, and this should guarantee that this type of situation is not going to occur."
"I would also deny the truth of some of the assertions made about the functioning of ATMs."
"There have indeed been practical problems."
"Anyone who goes to automated toll booths machines not far from here will see that some machines do not work with the currencies of every Union country."
"These are practical problems, whose importance we should not exaggerate: they are merely anecdotes within an enormously important and complex process."
"Nor do I feel that there are major pricing problems or that prices in the sales will influence prices in January, as they have not done in the past, since they have never been taken into account."
"Last week, speaking with the former chairman of Ecofin, Mr Reynders, we said that the clear lesson we have learned from this process is that the next time we change currency we must not do it on the first of January."
"But since I am sure that this situation will not arise, I would say that we have no need to worry about this problem either."
"Ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for your immense cooperation during this period."
"It has been crucial to helping the good work of the Member States, to ensuring that the public has been better informed and also to providing encouragement for the Commission' s work."
"The debate is closed."
"Procurement"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"Report (A5-0378/2001) by Zappalà, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts (COM(2000) 275 - C5-0367/2000 - 2000/0115(COD)) and"
"Report (A5-0379/2001) by Zappalà, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors (COM(2000) 276 - C5-0368/2000 - 2000/0117(COD))."
"(IT) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this House and I wish you and the entire House a successful two and a half years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to vote on the directive on public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts and the directive on specific sectors - entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors - in plenary. The Commission worked on them for four years, conducting a series of hearings, studies and assessments."
"Then Parliament worked on them for a further two years. A very well-attended public hearing took place and the Committee of the Regions, trade associations and professionals from all over Europe were also consulted."
"The fact that such a huge amount of work has been necessary should not surprise us, considering that public works contracts take up around 15% of the Union' s total GDP, that is over EUR 1 500 billion."
"It is estimated that only 20% of that sum is actually covered by the provisions of the current directives in that the threshold above which it is mandatory to apply them is relatively high and, in any case, more or less equal to that laid down in the agreements for the participation of third countries."
"The current directives are now outdated and therefore need revising and bringing into line with new technologies and new market trends."
"It was precisely the need to increasingly develop the internal market which prompted the Commission to research and propose the directives in question."
"The subject is of considerable importance and could not and still must not be treated lightly."
"In addition to individual Members, four Parliamentary committees delivering opinions and the committee responsible - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - examined the texts and tabled amendments: almost more than half this House has been able to examine, debate and amend the texts."
"It is a simple matter to summarise the contents: they revise and modernise the current directives, they introduce electronic auctions; they clarify the standards on technical specifications, they define rules on award criteria, they simplify the thresholds and they introduce a Common Procurement Vocabulary."
"Overall, the proposals deserve our support and, indeed, have it: we are all aware of how important they are and we all want their path to be smooth."
"However, the most significant past and present problems which have emerged and which are the subject of debate within the different political groupings, and between the groupings and between national representatives need to be highlighted."
"The thresholds, or the value below which the directives are not binding."
"This value, which - as I have said - is already relatively high, corresponds, however, to the value laid down in the agreements with third countries, in line with the Commission' s proposal."
"It has been proposed to increase this value."
"That would raise two problems: it would reduce the number of work contracts required to comply with the directives, possibly to the advantage of third countries whose existing contracts cannot be reviewed."
"However, it has been maintained that, even if the thresholds are raised, the number of contracts awarded to European tenderers will not decrease because, below a certain value, it is not economically beneficial for businesses to operate away from their region, still less their country."
"A further consideration is the possibility that each Member State and each regional government could apply local rules where the threshold is not reached."
"That would mean that the higher the thresholds, the greater the disparities between legislation within the Union. Thus, the rules within the Union would become even less uniform."
"In my opinion, whatever the thresholds, we must not allow there to be differing legislation within the Union."
"That would shrink, rather than expand the common market; it would also make it possible for individual territorial legislative authorities to restrict access in their regional or national territory purely to local operators."
"This should only happen where the matter is not regulated by the directives."
"Thus, the general contents of the directives must be included in national or regional legislation as well, and an amendment has been tabled proposing this."
"Another major issue is environmental and social concerns."
"It has been proposed that the directive should incorporate specific rules governing these areas."
"This suggestion has prompted broad, far-reaching debate and could lead to the report being referred back to committee if a position supported by a sufficient majority is not achieved at the vote."
"I feel that a law intended to further the internal market' s development in an economic sector and increase competitiveness cannot introduce principles which are not already laid down by the sector' s legislation."
"The Commission' s proposal contains sufficient provisions as it is to ensure that all the principles in force on the environment and workers' rights are respected in the drawing up of calls for tender."
"This legislation cannot be expanded or altered by means of directives whose scope should be limited to works, supply and service contracts."
"The related amendments, adopted, moreover, at the vote by a number of committees delivering opinions and by the committee responsible, seek to introduce new rules."
"Were these amendments also to be adopted in plenary, I feel that it would be better to keep the current texts unaltered rather than to have texts which, although more up-to-date, could well mean a step backwards in basic areas."
"There is a further issue which these texts cannot disregard but which the Commission has failed to deal with adequately: intellectual services."
"The time has come to make a clear distinction between intellectual services and executive services, between design and execution."
"This is a difficult concept for certain trade associations to take on board: as they see it, they are defending long-established positions."
"However, intellectual activity cannot be considered to be the same as manufacturing something and a company cannot do everything. It cannot carry out both design and execution, except in exceptional cases or where specific technologies are involved."
"There are two of reasons for this: works of art are not quantifiable: no two ideas are alike."
"The history of Europe as a whole, give or take a century, is full of different kinds of works which have survived the passage of time because of their artistic value."
"Not everything, not every service can be compared to a work of art, but the products of the mind cannot be confused with mere execution."
"An executing company possesses skills and experience and executive technology and is therefore the most suitable company to design and implement others' ideas on a technical level, but that is all, with a few rare exceptions."
"By separating intellectual services from executive services we will be according the professions and the products of the mind their due value."
"Joint contract awards, where contracts for executive design alone and execution are awarded together, are appropriate if there are intellectual service providers qualified as such according to the prevailing legislation in the company or attached to it."
"These considerations are the basis both for the amendment which makes it possible to award contracts for the design and execution of works either separately or together but requires justification to be produced where mixed contracts are awarded, and for the amendment which clearly defines what is meant by preliminary project paper, final project paper and executive project paper."
"Lastly, Mr President, two directives are before Parliament which are essentially similar in that certain specific sectors have been liberalised or will be in the not-too-distant future."
"Telecommunications are already considered to have been liberalised and are therefore not being taken into consideration."
"The gradual liberalisation of the water, energy and transport sectors, monitored directly by the Commission or, upon request, by the individual States, will allow the second directive to expire without making it necessary to amend the first directive."
"Overall, I hope that objective considerations will prompt us to adopt provisions which are specific to the sectors without expanding on them dangerously, provisions which will increasingly further the development of the internal market, which take into account the forthcoming accession to the Union of other countries which have their own traditions and needs, and which will make our rules increasingly uniform rather than fragmented."
"Furthermore, I feel we ought to acknowledge that the work carried out by the Commission in its proposal deserves our greatest appreciation."
"Lastly, I have to say that I am proud to have helped to develop and, I hope, improve legislation which both contributes to the building of a more united, stronger Europe and also curbs the fraud and malpractice which very often prevail in economics."
"Precisely in order to prevent loopholes, it is better for the directives to suffer a setback, should this prove necessary, than to have rules which are too loose."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a look at the economic and competitive aspects of public tendering from the point of view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr Zappalà has just referred to the fact that, according to the Commission's estimate at any rate, 14% to 15% of the EU's GDP is accounted for by building and supply contracts and contracts to provide services, all granted by the State or by enterprises whose function is to provide services for the general public."
"Looked at in terms of actual figures, 15% of the EU's GDP of about EUR 900 billion per annum amounts to EUR 125 to EUR 130 billion, not a small sum by any means."
"In this very area of public contracting, though, the internal market has not yet prevailed to any particular degree."
"There is a need for change to be brought about here."
"The award of contracts across frontiers is still the exception."
"Regulations are complex, muddled, rigid, cumbersome and bureaucratic, and the integration of social concerns and environmental issues into procurement practice has not yet been clarified either."
"Those, at any rate, are the challenges Parliament itself enumerated in its debates on the Green Paper and the communication from the Commission in 1996 and 1998."
"It is for that reason that we must now focus on the economic objectives and those related to competition policy."
"Our aim is also to help bring the Internal Market to fruition in this area."
"There is a need for clear, transparent rules that do not discriminate against anyone tendering for these contracts."
"On the other hand, though, there must also be the guarantee that nobody tendering for a contract can gain unjustifiable advantages for himself."
"It must therefore be made clear that standards must be adhered to as laid down by the law on labour, pricing and the environment."
"It is for that reason that Mr Zappalà is not quite correct when he argues in his final remarks that the economic aspects should be separated from the others."
"You cannot, of course, evade the other standards in order to gain an economic advantage."
"That is one of the ground rules that we all share, and it must also be obeyed."
"Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has long argued for greater consideration of social and employment standards in public procurement in two ways."
"The first is by ensuring that current legal provisions are complied with by all tenderers so as to avoid any unfair competition."
"I would ask Members to bear that in mind in the light of what the rapporteur said in his introductory remarks."
"We need to note in this respect that it is not a matter of social criteria - putting a question mark over the objective nature of the procurement process - but the very opposite: what matters is to create a level playing field for all those taking part in a procurement procedure."
"The second way in which we want social criteria to be taken into account is by enabling contracting authorities to pursue certain social and employment objectives, such as equal opportunities and social inclusion in connection with procurement. But this is always - again I would stress this in the light of what the rapporteur has said - subject to the strict requirement that it does not distort competition."
"This is made plain repeatedly in the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, that were in turn inspired by the opinion of the Committee on Employment."
"The opinion of the Committee on Employment looked at the different stages of the tendering process and made a number of recommendations for each of those stages."
"At the first stage, the need for the inclusion of a reference to the law applicable should become a component of the contract documentation."
"Candidates, tenderers in a procedure, should have access to all the information on all social and employment criteria that they should be taking into account."
"Article 27 is particularly important in the general directive in that respect."
"I would draw Members' attention to Amendment No 129 by Mrs Berger."
"It is an excellent amendment, which I hope will be supported by the House."
"At the second stage we need to ensure that we have proper compliance with the standards laid down in the first stage and there should be a possibility to exclude people who have not toed the line in the past in relation to those social and employment standards."
"Article 46 is particularly important in that respect and I would draw Members' attention to Amendments Nos 82, 86, 87 and 89."
"During the selection of candidates and the award of the contract, we need to ensure compliance with legal provisions relating to employment protection and working conditions."
"That is Article 53, which has attracted most attention in the discussions inside the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I would draw Members' attention in that respect to Amendments Nos 134 and 140."
"I sincerely hope we can reach agreement on one of those amendments in our vote tomorrow."
"Finally, there needs to be an adequate review procedure to ensure that these criteria are applied in the execution of the contract."
"Amendment No 108, among others, is important in that respect."
"I would draw attention to one final amendment, which is important."
"It was highlighted in the opinion of the Committee on Employment and relates to sheltered employment."
"Amendment No 36 gives Member States the possibility to reserve certain contracts for sheltered employment schemes or sheltered workshops where the majority of workers in those schemes or workshops are people with disabilities."
"This is a longstanding issue in some Member States, in particular my own."
"I hope this amendment can be adopted tomorrow and we get a clear reference to this in the directive for the future."
"That is the main gist of the opinion of the Committee on Employment."
"These concerns are all reflected in the amendments to be considered tomorrow."
"I hope they will command the support of the House."
"Mr President, the environment can of course be protected in a number of ways."
"Here in the European Parliament, we try to do this in mainly two ways. Either we try, by means of directives and regulations, to ban or limit environmentally damaging activities; or we try, by means of directives and regulations, to encourage private individuals, companies and public authorities voluntarily to act in ways that reduce damage to the environment."
"I should like to say to Mr Zappalà that the time is quite simply past when purely economic criteria could be considered and that the EC Treaty now in actual fact obliges us to take account of social and environmental, as well as economic, factors."
"The two draft procurement directives must therefore make it possible for local authorities, county councils and state authorities to procure goods and services in such a way that there are minimal strains upon the environment."
"I think the Commission' s proposal is odd in as much as it makes environmentally friendly procurement of this kind impossible."
"In the two opinions for which I have been draftsman in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, we have clearly incorporated the opportunity for taking account of the environment in procurement."
"These opinions were adopted in their entirety without any changes whatsoever, meaning that there had been a very strong and clear input from the Committee on the Environment."
"I have also been glad to note that the majority of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment have been adopted by the committee responsible."
"There are nonetheless a couple of points on which the committee responsible has arrived at odd results."
"This is above all the case with the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts. Article 53 of this has to be changed so that it is significantly easier to take account of the environment in awarding contracts."
"In the second directive of the two - namely the proposal for a directive coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors -the same change is not, however, made to Article 54, which is of course identical to Article 53 in the directive first referred to. I presume this is an oversight, but I want in any case to draw attention to this and call upon everyone to vote in favour of Amendment No 140 to the report on the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts."
"These changes are significant."
"The two directives ought, as I said, to tally with one another."
"If the wording, 'the most economically advantageous tender for the contracting authorities' remains in place, it means that the contracting authorities do not need to take account of the environment or of life cycles and the interests of society in a broader perspective."
"It is therefore very important that we should in actual fact change this wording so that it agrees with that in the proposal for a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts."
"These criteria do in fact form part of the Sixth Environment Programme."
"They form part of the integrated product policy, and the rules must also of course promote, among many other things, sustainable development in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I cannot fathom the incomprehensible impairment of the existing directive by the Commission, which believes that adopting, for example, a life cycle perspective as an evaluation criterion is not permitted."
"However, this issue has been subject to legal proceedings . The Advocate-General has clearly come out in favour of its being my and the Committee on the Environment' s view that is correct, and not that put forward by the Commission."
"I am also extremely pleased about the changes made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because sustainable development involves having to take account of economic, social and environmental criteria."
"I therefore hope that we shall vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr President, I too would like to start by saying something about the question of whether economic legislation is in some way neutral and capable of being separated from other aspects."
"We have an example in the field of the so-called Utilities Directive where legislation can achieve widely different effects whilst appearing to be neutral."
"If we say that the Directive applies to operations in municipal hands but not to those that are contracted out, we have then made enterprises with the same purpose subject to completely different legal regulations, and the effects are not neutral."
"It was for this reason that a large and cross-party majority of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which does not otherwise have a reputation for particular concern for social and environmental matters, was prepared to take up these aspects in its proposals."
"I would like to take this opportunity to describe some of them clearly, as we did not just have discussions, but also incorporated into the present proposal significant results from the Industry Committee and also the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Our most important proposal is that, in addition to the provisions of social security and labour law, collective agreements between employers and trade unions - as our proposal still terms them - should also be adhered to at the place of performance."
"I believe that the Industry Committee, in order to exclude the possibility of misunderstandings, might also find the formulation ""generalised collective agreements"" acceptable, especially as the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market opens the door to other misunderstandings."
"We must in any case make one thing clear, and I say this with reference to the Member State from which I come. We cannot have elements of the political spectrum there fomenting fears for the labour market on the grounds of the forthcoming eastward enlargement, while some of us in this House are engaged in opening the doors and thus possibly justifying their fears."
"We must not leave ourselves open to that reproach."
"I also welcome the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s acceptance of our demand that enterprises be liable to exclusion from the tendering procedure if they fail to comply with the provisions of the law on tariffs and other social security and labour law in the State of establishment or another affected country."
"We have incorporated in the Utilities Directive and in the draft under consideration today two important items of potential significance to municipal enterprises, one stating that associated or joint companies with at least a 50% average share in turnover shall be excluded from the scope of the Directive."
"That is in the text as well."
"The other states that the supply of energy and fuel shall be excluded from the scope of this Directive, thus maintaining the current status quo against the background of the varying states of liberalisation prevailing in the European Union, and avoiding the situation I described at the beginning of my speech in which operations belonging to municipalities are treated differently from contracted-out enterprises."
"We are also in favour of postal services being covered by this Directive - not all kinds of postal service though, but only those for which there is as yet no free competition."
"If my observation on the subject of tariffs is also included in the final vote, and if the points on which I have enlarged are taken into account, then that is a result with which I think the Industry Committee will be very satisfied."
"Mr President, I would like to comment on the second proposal for a directive and I shall also take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election."
"I would like to inform the House that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs unanimously adopted the opinion for which I am rapporteur on 12 June 2001."
"This unanimous vote is important, in that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs fully acknowledged that the procedures on public contracts were instruments falling under the sustainable development strategy and that the environment should be integrated across all the European Union' s policies, as advocated by the Treaty."
"Within this framework, the relevant authorities, which have political responsibility, must be permitted to draw up environmental as well as social criteria that they intend to use in awarding public contracts, whilst, of course, respecting the principle of non-discrimination."
"To avoid repeating what other speakers have already said, I would like to draw attention to two points."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposed simplifying the award procedures, firstly by doubling the thresholds above which the directive applies for public contracts and, secondly, it is also proposing to give special protection to small and medium-sized companies by stipulating that the contracting authorities have the power to decide that 15% of the total number of contracts that they award can be granted to small and medium-sized firms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are no doubt of the fundamental opinion that environmental and social security policy matters should actually be governed by environmental and social security law respectively."
"There are, though, exceptions to every rule."
"Not, of course, being unacquainted with the ways of the world, we are aware that we cannot carry on this debate on these new proposals by the Commission for a directive on the award of public contracts without taking their social and environmental aspects into account to some degree."
"It is therefore quite clear to us that social and environmental considerations of course play a part in this decision, but we are making a very clear distinction."
"We are of the opinion that, in the European internal market, the conditions for all who participate in this Internal Market should be equal."
"The key phrase 'level playing field' was mentioned by an earlier speaker."
"Such a 'level playing field' is of course guaranteed only when the criteria we are trying to add on alongside the economic criteria are already a component part of the tendering conditions and are not introduced or implemented only later, when the tendering process has been completed and discussion has moved on to the award."
"This has been the reason why, in the debate so far, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has always taken the view that, in so far as such criteria are also to be taken into account, they should be so under the heading of the tendering conditions and not left to be dealt with when the contract is awarded."
"I would therefore like to make it clear that Article 53, which was constantly being addressed and represented one of the main points of discussion and dispute, refers to the award."
"That is why the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats will take a restrictive approach when the amendments to Article 53 are voted on."
"We want Article 53, as proposed by the Commission, amended as little as possible."
"Only then can we guarantee that the possibility of manipulation does not eventually arise, with the authorities that invite the tenders ending up able to use, as it were, criteria introduced into the discussion retrospectively to come to decisions that have quite different backgrounds from those under discussion here and which are informed by objective criteria."
"I see this as a quite crucial difference, one that needs to be brought out in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that has perhaps not yet become completely clear in the Groups."
"If I may say just one thing more, we are also opposed to incorporating conditions in the Directive that will in fact end up bringing the internal market to a standstill and causing it to fail, just as we are opposed to leaving those who will later transpose the Directive into national legislation free to include such conditions."
"For example, in Germany, my homeland, a so-called 'tariff fidelity law' is under discussion, which will in fact - and I share Mr Kuhne's view on this - mean that tendering will not be on the basis of the generalised collective agreements - which are like laws that one must obey - but rather on the basis of tariff agreements, ranging from regional down to in-house, a condition that will make it possible to put a contract out to tender in such a way that only one enterprise ends up being able to participate in the process."
"That smashes the Internal Market to bits."
"Such a thing is an absurdity, and one we are not prepared to go along with."
"We will therefore vote against such a possibility' s being opened up by means of amendments."
"It is, however, very much my view that what Mr Kuhne said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, namely that there should be no going beyond what is generally binding, is something that could certainly meet with support from me or from the Group I belong to."
"My Group has not yet come to a final decision on the threshold values."
"We will be doing that in our group meeting before the vote, as there are differing views among us on the subject."
"I would, though, like to point out that Mr Zappalà has made a very interesting proposal. I refer to Amendment No 147 which is by way of a compromise in the event of an increase in the threshold values being decided on and is designed to ensure that the fundamental principles of this Directive apply to all contracts awarded under this threshold as well."
"One could say at this point that this goes without saying, but the proposal includes a significant innovation, which I think would be a real step forward for the internal market - the justiciability of what we are doing here, and the justiciability of the tendering procedure."
"That is at present not guaranteed in all the Member States under the threshold."
"I believe that, if this were to be possible, it would represent real progress."
"In particular, I ask the Commission to reconsider their attitude towards Amendment No 147 and to inform Parliament tomorrow of whether they might give this Amendment their approval, because I think this could be a genuine compromise on the issue of threshold values."
"Finally, I would like to thank most warmly the rapporteurs, principally Mr Zappalà."
"This is one of this House's most problematic legislative proposals, and you have so far piloted us through its depths and shallows very well."
"For that you have my gratitude."
"Mr President, let me also congratulate you on your election."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on behalf of my group and thanking him and all the draftsmen of the consulting committees' opinions for the enormous work involved in this report."
"We have already been occupying ourselves for a long time with these two draft Directives from the Commission, a good year and a half in fact."
"We had a public hearing on this subject a year ago."
"I think the intensive discussions and the highly laborious vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it high time that we complete the first reading with the plenary vote tomorrow - which I hope will actually take place."
"The many amendments that we have had to deal with in Committee and, to some extent, still have to deal with in tomorrow's plenary session, do not mean that we were not in agreement with the Commission's basic premises."
"The consolidation of the previous Directives, and their harmonisation and modernisation, is certainly a very important step."
"As far as my group is concerned, in addition to a number of other important topics, some of which have already been addressed, there is a central issue on which we cannot agree with the Commission."
"I refer to the new criteria for the awarding of contracts, where the Commission is attempting very substantial changes in content in comparison with the former legal position, and what it is consolidating is not only current legislation."
"The Commission's proposal dramatically restricts the room for manoeuvre which was formerly provided for and which is still current law, and does so above all at the expense of qualitative criteria, notably those to do with social security, the environment and health."
"In its two interpretative statements, the Commission has itself shown how this room for manoeuvre and rearrangement can today be used without discrimination."
"The European Court of Justice, too, has handed down a very good and reliable interpretation of current law in indicative orders and particularly now in the final plea in the Helsinki case."
"The Commission appears to find the current legal position unacceptable for political reasons, and it is therefore to undergo massive alteration."
"A number of Members will probably be very confused at this point, as much of what the Commission thankfully sets out in its two interpretative statements will, by reason of the new legal position it has outlined, no longer be feasible if we do not vote any amendments to it tomorrow."
"Principals, such as municipalities for example, may now only think, in purely egotistical terms, of the immediate benefit to themselves."
"The economic advantage must unambiguously be the principal's."
"In Austria we call this the 'Florian principle' according to which it is better to let your neighbour's house burn down than your own."
"It means that factors occurring to the detriment and cost of another local or regional authority must no longer be taken into account when awarding a contract."
"The Commission also wants to prohibit the imposition of criteria relating to the manufacture of a product."
"This makes illegal, for example, an invitation to tender that specifies wood products from sustainable forestry or foodstuffs that are grown organically or derived from species-friendly animal husbandry and represents discrimination against conventional providers."
"This not only undermines the objectives of the Treaty, for example the integration of environmental protection into all spheres of policy, and also a policy of sustainable development, it also restricts the autonomy and democracy of cities, municipalities, regions and federal territories."
"We are then using EU law to prohibit a democratically elected institution such as a city or a municipality from deciding to introduce, or continue with, an environmentally friendly purchasing policy."
"I do not believe that this will enhance the European Union's popularity among its citizens."
"It is also, indeed, the perspective of Europe's cities and municipalities that leads to a majority of our Group' s advocating the raising of the threshold."
"Even in a small community like my own, in a country in which the climate means that building is very expensive, even the mere building of a school goes above the threshold."
"The costs of putting the work out to tender are significantly greater."
"Yet this amount cannot be cut back because it is still too low to attract tenders from other countries."
"It has already been emphasised that the rules of the Internal Market also apply below the threshold values."
"I would like, in my concluding remarks, to appeal to the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats to change the position they adopted in committee on tendering conditions, even if only on a few points."
"We have brought in differing split votes on my Amendments Nos 134 and 110."
"I think, then, that it must be possible on this basis to further improve these points in the Commission's text."
"Mr President, it is good that we are holding this debate at a busy time in the House and that we are not just engaging in legal hair-splitting, for the directives on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts are among the most important methods we have for preventing administrative corruption in the most effective way."
"We are talking about the most hated and most loved directives which have consequences quite far afield in the national administrations in various parts of the EU."
"During the hearing in the committee, I and many others besides me became concerned that so few cross-border offers are made."
"I think that the most important thing today, following this debate and reading, is that we obtain directives that operate as well as possible, together with an important follow-up mechanism."
"There is a lot left to be desired."
"A lot has already been said about environmental issues, but I think it is important for us to note that, on environmental issues, we must give public authorities the same opportunity we require the most progressive companies to exercise."
"Why should it not be possible to compete in this area within the public sector, just as it is within the private sector?"
"The Commission says that as much value for money as possible must be obtained."
"I want to say, however, that, in this context, it is quite often a question of self-governing local authorities which operate in such a way that, if a mistake is made and people are not satisfied, the latter can replace the decision makers."
"The decision-makers want to see good environmental decisions made by their local authorities."
"I also think there is something extremely seductive about the argument that, since we have adopted directives on how, for example, we are to promote the use of renewable energy, we should also have procurement directives that encourage such use."
"It is a familiar argument, but one worth mentioning."
"I share the assessment which says that the Commission' s approach in the proposal is rigid in relation to prevailing legal practice."
"There is, however, a difference between the environmental and the 'social' issues."
"The basic conditions we have when it comes to environmental issues are relatively uniform, but we have extremely different directives where social issues are concerned."
"It is interesting to note that so many of those who have talked about social issues come from Germany."
"I come from a small EU country where my experience has shown that, precisely with reference to 'collective agreements' , it has been extremely difficult for Finnish companies to enter the German, and also the Swedish, construction markets."
"That is why it is important for us not to adopt provisions that are ambiguous."
"The basic conditions are not uniform when it comes to social issues."
"We do not know which regulations are to be complied with in this area."
"I still hope, however, to be able to send an important signal on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Party, to the effect that if the proposals for increased threshold values are adopted, we shall not be able to support the proposals because, in our view, they limit this area of application still more."
"We have said in many contexts that we cannot support these proposals because the whole purpose and whole issue then become meaningless."
"That is why I want to appeal to my fellow MEPs concerning this issue."
"Finally, I wish to point out that the one compromise amendment that has been tabled is not, in the light of many countries' practice, in actual fact a genuine compromise amendment."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on your election, by a large majority, as Vice-President."
"I shall describe a case which relates to these Directives, and which concerns my home city of Helsinki."
"Some time ago the Helsinki public transport corporation, being the public procurement authority, put out to public tender certain bus routes and set criteria stipulating inter alia that the buses to be procured were to have the lowest possible emissions; in other words, that they had to be environmentally-friendly."
"And so the City of Helsinki consequently opted to procure buses which run on natural gas and whose emissions are very low."
"A competing bidder was not satisfied with this, but appealed to the national court, claiming inter alia that the City of Helsinki had selected a bid which was not the most advantageous one economically, in other words it was not the cheapest."
"The advocate-general of the European Court of Justice has recently issued his opinion on this matter, which may be adopted as the judgment of the Court."
"In fact the opinion of the advocate-general supports very strongly the view of the City of Helsinki that a public procurement authority should have the right to set environmentally-friendly criteria which it will use in its competitive tender, and also to select products in compliance with this."
"It is interesting that the position of the advocate-general is precisely the same as that of the Commission's Directorate-General which is responsible for environmental matters, and different from that of the Directorate-General which is responsible for the internal market."
"Now I would also like to draw the attention of Commissioner Bolkestein to this decision, which may well in fact become final; we do not of course know this as yet."
"These Directives are of great economic significance: our obligation is to enable the rules of the game to be as transparent and straightforward as possible, and competitive tenders to be as open as possible, and also to ensure that public authorities are able to promote solutions which are environmentally friendly and also socially favourable."
"To my esteemed and dear colleague Astrid Thors I would like to say that of course social legislation is different in the different countries, but perhaps this is the precise reason why we should also permit a public authority to comply with its own social criteria, and why we should find sustainable compromises between the political groups in these questions."
"Mr Vice-President, I would also like to congratulate you on your election."
"Like my fellow Members, who have underlined that this was a report of titanic proportions, requiring a great deal of work, I would like to use my two minutes' speaking time to try to put forward what I personally believe to be the essential points, bearing in mind those involved, particularly the local and regional authorities and the citizens."
"In my view, the Zappalà report, which was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs, improves on the Commission' s original proposal for a directive."
"On the pretext of simplifying and updating the existing legislation, the Commission' s proposal does indeed propose to make the regulations uniform, but the main way, if not the only way, it achieves this is through liberalisation and this is something I cannot accept."
"Thus, when it comes to using prices as a criterion for awarding contracts, the lowest price is favoured over social and environmental criteria."
"I believe therefore, as do other Members, that the stakes are very high."
"Given their activity, public authorities should favour employment and sustainable development but decisions are instead based on financial criteria alone."
"However, in March 2000, the European Trade Union Confederation pointed out how much importance the Community regime for public contracts placed upon the concept of price, to the detriment of social and territorial cohesion, equality and employment."
"As I said, the Zappalà report improves on the Commission' s directive, particularly by raising the thresholds on opening up public procurement contracts by 50% and also by taking into greater consideration the social and environmental criteria."
"If adopted in its current form, I think it might represent an improvement on the current situation."
"Despite this, it is essentially the approach of liberalisation that is favoured."
"In a communication of 15 October 2001, the Commission was forced to put forward the option of integrating social and environmental aspects into procedures for the award of public contracts."
"However, this communication is not legally binding in character."
"We must therefore go further and approach it in a different way; this is the sense of the amendments tabled by my group."
"Within the award criteria, employment, the environment and town planning must be put on the same footing as economic cost."
"Of course, my group' s vote will depend on the outcome of the vote on the committee' s amendments and also on the amendments that will be proposed tomorrow."
"Mr President, I too join my colleagues in congratulating you on your re-election as Vice-President."
"I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur and all the draftsmen on their work on what may appear to be a very simple topic but, when you get into the detail and analysis of it, proves extremely difficult."
"Rather than repeating what has been said already, I would like to deal with three particular points."
"Firstly, with regard to raising the limits on when tenders have to be put out for consultation, looking for the 50% increase is important because it has already been proven that the present limits do not allow for greater cross-border interaction between companies and between companies and agencies."
"This is because the contract limit is too small and the economic reality underlying this is that to move your operation into another Member State requires extra money and a more valuable contract to make such a move profitable."
"There is no point in saying that we should be spending public money merely to prop up a failing or ageing system."
"We should be using the money properly - of course to increase infrastructure, to provide better services and to increase local employment as much as possible - but it should not be used merely as a substitute for private and other investments or for other initiatives to create local employment."
"The second area, concerning environmental considerations, is another very important question."
"It is one in which each and every one of us would agree that certain minimum standards have to be laid down."
"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that we put in place proper controls and mechanisms to guarantee that what we pass on to future generations is in a better condition than that in which we received it."
"However, that should not be used as an obstacle or a block to development."
"There is a happy medium and a balance between both, which must be maintained."
"My third point concerns social obligations, and in particular I agree fully with the Members who said that there must be a social return for the contracting authority and its area from the awarding of the contract."
"However, it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward."
"My last point concerning the qualitative selection criteria."
"Of course we must have protections in place to ensure that those who are guilty of wrongdoing, fraud, racketeering and of interfering with Community assets and finances should be excluded from public contracts."
"However, I have one concern with regard to the question of a judgment that is not yet final: we are acting as judge and jury in denying somebody a right to be an applicant for a tender without having a final decision or analysis made as to whether that person is guilty of a crime or not."
"This is something we must be very careful of."
"In conclusion, it is about time that these directives were brought together, that the texts were clarified and that greater certainty was put into the legislative framework under which people have to operate."
"But, most importantly of all, it must be seen as a move towards guaranteeing better public services for all people."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate you on your re-election as Vice-President of this Parliament."
"The Commission proposes to consolidate and modernise the present procurement directives."
"This is with good reason, for they are too complex and too bureaucratic for contracting authorities and industry alike."
"Can we realise political ambitions via the public procurement procedures?"
"This question seems to be at the heart of the long-term discussion on this topic."
"Via Amendment No 98, this report wishes to add both social and environmental criteria to the assessment of the most favourable tenderer."
"Environmental criteria - a European area of policy par excellence - can be measured objectively by means of management standards and can therefore easily be deployed in practice."
"However, we believe that it would be taking matters too far to prescribe at European level that national bodies must take account of social criteria in their assessment."
"Social policy is to be established nationally, and that is how it should continue to be."
"Furthermore, this amendment would make the procedure considerably more complex, both for the contracting authorities and the tenderers."
"It could lead to all kinds of new points of contention and differences in interpretation."
"This is why the directive would become just as difficult to implement as the current one."
"We wholeheartedly support the exclusion of economic operators that have been convicted of offences."
"In my country, there are currently various criminal cases pending against building contractors, and it seems as if fraud is becoming a widespread phenomenon."
"This text drives the message home to industry: you do not mess with public money."
"Mr President, these two directives are important when it comes to creating an internal market that operates well."
"Procurement in the EU accounts for EUR 1.5 billion per year, EUR 40 million of it in Sweden alone."
"The figures show the importance of clear and simple ground rules."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises must be able to compete on equal terms."
"If the EU is to become the world' s most competitive market by 2010, small and medium-sized companies need to be given a boost and the conditions under which they operate made easier for them."
"It is important to maintain the threshold values in order to obtain solutions that favour consumers and stimulate competition."
"In that way, we can increase the number of purchases and create the basic conditions for a European procurement market."
"It would prevent protectionist behaviour in national markets and - something which is not to be sniffed at - make it easier for politicians to be thrifty with people' s taxes."
"Clear rules must also apply to environmental and social considerations."
"The two directives we are debating today are financial directives."
"If and when account is to be taken of environmental and social factors, this should happen when the procurement criteria are established."
"In that way, the rules for those who submit offers will become clear, and they will know what prior conditions apply to procurement."
"It is the tenderer with the financially most advantageous offer to whom the contract must be awarded."
"I also wish to agree completely with what Mrs Thors said about her experience of small countries engaging with the German market."
"I have the same experience where my own country is concerned."
"Nonetheless, I also want fully to acknowledge my country' s extreme uncompetitiveness in the construction sphere, something which also leads to our having high housing costs."
"Our goal must be to raise the quality and reduce the costs of cross-border procurement by simplifying it and making it more efficient and widespread."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate you on your election."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of laws are like our favourite clothes."
"If we do not look after them, they rapidly become unsightly and end up being unusable."
"They no longer fulfil their purpose."
"So it is only a good thing that the Commission has taken in hand the law on the award of public contracts, which dates back to the Seventies, and that we are now engaged in doing justice to the requirements of modern times and of the Internal Market with two directives."
"A certain amount has already been said about the modernisation of the directives on the award of public contracts, and I do not need to add anything to that."
"I would, though, like to sound a clear warning that we may be improving the law on the award of public contracts in technical terms and making it more manageable, but at the same time causing its substance to deteriorate."
"That is what the Commission intends with its proposed text, in which the smoothly functioning internal market and competition sweep all before them."
"People's justifiable desires and interests are neglected."
"That is something this Parliament must not permit."
"Our duty is not to any old mechanism or economic ideology."
"Our duty is to the citizens of Europe and their needs, and we are, moreover, obliged to see to it that their taxes are not squandered."
"A well-functioning internal market can help in this if it adheres to people-friendly standards."
"Public contracts cannot, then, simply be awarded to the lowest bidder."
"Social requirements must, as criteria, be no less decisive than consideration for people's health and careful treatment of the environment."
"That is why there are amendments tabled by my group, and, in my view, if they are not adopted, it will be impossible to vote for the Directive on the award of public contracts."
"Let me give an example."
"It is, of course, obvious that contractors must abide by regulations on industrial safety and working conditions as well as by all the other collective and individual provisions of labour law."
"This also includes adherence to the wage agreements in force where the principal is located."
"Without that, we easily end up in a spiral of discrimination and wages dumping at the expense of many workers' families."
"Competition in the internal market must not be allowed to be like that."
"Competition must not be pursued at the expense of the environment, and so it is perfectly clear that public principals must require the maintenance of high environmental standards."
"Let me close with a word on the threshold values for European tendering."
"Since the existing threshold values have demonstrably failed to bring about any increase in cross-frontier exchange in the sphere of public contracting, we need have no qualms about raising them."
"Speaking personally, I have no problem with the idea of doubling them."
"Raised thresholds deter unjustifiably high expenditure on smaller projects, promote greater flexibility in the planning and realisation of manageable projects and contribute to the careful use of money raised from tax."
"The public will thank us if we do not oblige their mayors to throw the money out of the window with both hands."
"I would like to apologise to Mr Zappalà and also to the Commissioner for the fact that I cannot stay to the end; a party of visitors has been waiting for me since four o'clock, and I really must get to them, although I would actually have liked to stay to hear the Commissioner's reply."
"Mr President, at the heart of this debate is the theme of protecting the public interest in contracts awarded by public authorities."
"It is also, in the context of the internal market, about encouraging cross-border tendering and working: 15% of EU GDP - that is an important input in achieving public policy aims."
"We should be looking to achieve best value for our citizens and a transparent process for those tendering."
"But best value can never be based on purely financial criteria."
"Price alone can never be a complete measure of what is in the public interest, of what is the most advantageous offer."
"I remember, as the member of a local authority, seeing a council waste time, effort and money trying to unscramble a valuable school meals contract that proved to be totally unsatisfactory."
"Yes, the price was right, but only the lawyers won."
"The goals pursued by public authorities are justifiably, in the public interest, a mixture that includes environmental and social goals."
"As long as the playing field is level and the procedure is absolutely transparent, such goals and choices can and should be valid, as the ECJ has recently confirmed."
"Such choices, indeed, are a valid and intrinsic part of local political life."
"Mr President, it is a happy coincidence that you have taken the chair this afternoon for it permits me to say with what pride it is that I share with you a constituency under our present electoral arrangements as a fellow Member for Scotland."
"You have brought credit on our constituency in the dignified and splendid way you have conducted yourself over recent weeks and we are very pleased with that."
"In that constituency, as you well know, it is not taken for granted that what is publicly provided or done is bad and only what is privately done is good."
"Nor does the Commission take that view."
"But, as Mrs Wallis has just said, this debate focuses on the very question of what decisions are properly taken by the public authorities, by democratic procedures on the basis of public choice, and what must then reasonably be left to the market to deal with."
"It is crucial for that dividing line to be got right."
"Mrs Hautala asked a question which the Commissioner must answer when replying to this debate today."
"It is a question which can also be addressed to Mr Zappalà, who says that we should only take economic conditions into account, not, for example, environmental or social ones."
"If Helsinki or Edinburgh became seriously polluted with diesel fumes, that would give rise to costs."
"Somebody would have to pay to clean them up eventually."
"To say that is a non-economic cost is simply an odd kind of economics."
"So we turn the thing round: we ask who shall decide if the streets of Helsinki or the streets of Edinburgh need environmentally friendly and sustainable buses?"
"Who can best take that decision?"
"Is it best taken in Brussels?"
"Is it best taken in Strasbourg by this Parliament?"
"Is it best taken in London?"
"No, it is best taken in Edinburgh or in Helsinki."
"We need a decision of that kind to be taken locally."
"Of course, we do not want that decision to lead to unfair consequences."
"It must be open and transparent."
"Who can come and bid for this contract and on what terms can they obtain it?"
"That is fine, but do not exclude the local authority, the people of a region, from saying themselves what standards they demand of those who serve them."
"If that is to be ruled out by European law, Europe will not grow in popularity among its citizens."
"We must have this kind of clear responsibility for the public good taken by public authorities."
"I would like to hear the Commission's reply to that point."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s proposal for a directive and the report adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"However, we need amendments that include social and environmental requirements and equal treatment requirements in procedures."
"The amendments I have tabled seek to strengthen the role of awarding authorities in monitoring the quality of the tenderers and I would stress the importance of assessing the environmental impact of public and private projects."
"I would also stress the need to exclude from award procedures people condemned for crimes such as money laundering, fraud and racketeering."
"I want to emphasise this in this House too, for I am sad to say that my country, Italy, is still troubled by the Mafia and, contrary to what the Italian cabinet minister, Mr Lunardi, said, complicity with the Mafia is totally unacceptable."
"Mr President, may I too offer my congratulations to you on your election as first Vice-President."
"I should like to provide a different perspective on the debate this afternoon."
"In this debate we have not heard from the people who are now supplying public authorities across the European Union as a result of the tremendous progress that has been made in opening up public contracting all over the European Union."
"So far we have heard nothing this afternoon about the people who are driving the economy forward because they are getting open access to tenders, cheaply and readily available by electronic means."
"That applies to businesses, organisations, service providers, manufacturers, contractors all over the European Union."
"A few weeks ago I went to see one of those companies in my constituency."
"It employs 80 people."
"Every morning it logs on to the Official Journal."
"Five or six tenders are listed there, all for the United Kingdom."
"This company does not at the moment have export ambitions but the Official Journal gives it cheap, ready access to customers in public authorities to a standard format. It fulfils and puts in tenders for them every week."
"In this perspective I want to look at the balance between economic, environmental and social issues."
"That company in the Black Country in the United Kingdom employs 80 people, that is 80 much-needed jobs, and it complies with every single social requirement in United Kingdom law."
"It complies with all the environmental rules in United Kingdom law."
"It is perfectly entitled to apply for a contract."
"Why should that be otherwise?"
"Why should it have to do anything else?"
"This is primarily an economic instrument. That is what it was designed to be to begin with."
"We may want to add to its social burdens - and plenty of colleagues over there would like to do that."
"We will have many more debates with Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and other colleagues about adding to the requirements to improve the safety and health of their workers."
"That is fine."
"If companies comply with that, they should be entitled to apply for contracts."
"I want to pick up on Mr MacCormick's points, because methinks he protests too much."
"On the question of the Helsinki bus contract, surely it was up to the Helsinki authorities to decide, before they put the contract out to tender, what was the optimum and most environmentally friendly bus that they wanted?"
"It is not part of public contract to require the bus manufacturers to do an environmental appraisal for Helsinki before they then submit the contract."
"If the Helsinki authorities had said that they wanted 100 buses powered by natural gas and that is the contract, then fine, if that is what they want to do."
"But it should be done on an open and consistent basis."
"Finally, I want to turn to this question of thresholds."
"This seems to be the most extraordinary debate."
"I particularly refer to one of the opinions from EMAC, in which our colleague, who unfortunately is not here, said he wanted to simplify matters by raising thresholds but at the same time he wanted to allocate 15% of contracts to SMEs."
"Does he think that by removing a substantial number of contracts from the public procurement regime, by raising thresholds, he is going to improve the situation for SMEs?"
"What sort of world are we living in?"
"This is an area where we want SMEs to compete."
"We want local authorities to put in contracts on a consistent open basis that will give our citizens value for money."
"We want to oblige them to do that."
"Just because they find it difficult, because they think it costs them money - probably because they do not want to comply with all the requirements - they want more discretion to give contracts not on an open basis."
"That is what raising this public threshold is all about."
"We should not do it."
"It will undermine the value of a system that is working well already."
"That is what we should be looking at: improvement, not destruction."
"Mr President, I too have companies in my constituency that are benefiting from this public procurement regime."
"Indeed they are benefiting from providing euro slot machines for public authorities even though Britain is not in the euro zone."
"There are lots of opportunities here."
"But I want to direct some very pertinent questions to the Commissioner and I hope he will answer those questions in his response."
"Commissioner, we need some clarification regarding thresholds, as Mr Harbour has indicated."
"I would genuinely like to know what would be the effect on the public procurement market if thresholds were to be increased, and particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises and on consumers."
"I would also like to know, as regards our international obligations under the WTO general procurement agreement with third countries, whether it would be the case, as has been established by Commission services, that the US and Japan would actually be favoured contractors and that our EU suppliers would lose out because we would be operating two distinctly different regimes."
"I should like to raise questions on the social criteria."
"Members have already stressed the compatibility of incorporating strong social progress criteria in award procedures while respecting the principles of competition law and of equal treatment and non-discrimination."
"It ought to be possible to combine economic reform and competition policy with strong and sound social justice and social progress principles."
"I cannot understand why, if we have a system of transparency and open competition, how we cannot prevent that from being used as a protectionist smoke screen in the publication of tenders."
"Why has the Commission not incorporated the full force of good practice from European case law into the body of this directive to ensure that we guarantee the highest social and economic standards in public procurement?"
"Surely we owe that to our public authorities, to our consumers and indeed to our businesses."
"Why has the Commission gone down the route of a voluntary approach?"
"I hope the Commission will accept the amendments mentioned by my colleague, Mr Hughes, to allow for reserve contracts for sheltered employment schemes."
"I hope it will respect Parliament's wishes for a strong line to be taken in this directive, ensuring compliance with core labour standards and permitting the exclusion of those in breach of those standards."
"Mr President, my warmest congratulations on your election."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report has far more impact than would appear at first sight."
"Annually, thousands of contracts are awarded by public, often regional or local, governments."
"At the moment, public procurement is said to account for approximately 14% of the entire European GDP."
"However, existing legislation is too complicated and complex, as a result of which, to date, this market segment has been far too much hidden from the benefits of the internal market."
"The current report, therefore, cannot afford to miss its target, namely the simplification of legislation and greater opportunities for European procurement procedures."
"For these reasons, inter alia, I am opposed to raising the thresholds too high, as a result of which a meagre 8 to 12% of all procurements in the European Union would fall within the scope of this regulation."
"In addition, the introduction of social and environmental criteria must be handled with care."
"Too many conditions that are too wordy once again make matters much more difficult, both for our towns and municipalities and for our SMEs."
"We must realise that they will bear the brunt of this European legislation."
"We must bring them closer to Europe and get them to spread the European message."
"This is certainly not achieved by issuing an unhealthy number of rules and regulations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my heartfelt thanks and respect are owed to the rapporteur, who has drafted this material with much energy, discipline and intelligence."
"I admire him most of all for not losing his Roman cheerfulness despite what was at times a very difficult process."
"Many thanks also to my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, where we had what I think was one of our most interesting debates to date."
"The discussions in this House have also shown that views on threshold values and social standards cut across Group lines, and we can look forward to tomorrow's vote with great excitement."
"I see a requirement for the new Directives to be progressive, fair and functional."
"We support the modernisation proposed by the Commission, for example with regard to the introduction of electronic auctions and the electronic submission of tenders."
"What greatly worries me, though, is that on one point the Directive is not being made fairer."
"I am referring here to the issue of social and environmental standards."
"It is for the benefit of the other members of my group that I would like to expressly reiterate that the issue is not, for us, that social and environmental criteria have no part to play in the procedure whereby contracts are awarded. No!"
"Mr Hager has shown that very clearly."
"These standards must be laid down in the description of the product. We want to avoid the situation where, when the contract is awarded at the end of the process and the tenders have been compared and it is clear that tender no."
"1 is the best in economic terms, no. 2 is worse, no."
"3 is even worse than that and no. 4 is the worst of all, there is then another assessment which establishes that one firm is more socially responsible because it employs more disabled people and another more ecological because it has a waste management system, whereupon it is decided, despite the fact that there was another tender which was better in economic terms, to award the contract to the more expensive firm after all."
"That is the situation we want to avoid, for it would run counter to the internal market."
"That is why this is such an important point for us, and a Directive with standards of that sort would basically be no use to us anymore."
"Mr President, may I offer you my congratulations and best wishes; I know that you will continue to be as efficient as ever in the performance of your duties."
"The battle for social and environmental criteria, which was won mainly thanks to the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, proves that the European Parliament still basically supports the European social model and sustainable development, which is the only way to make Europe competitive in a global environment."
"The amendments to the social and environmental criteria, which have to be evaluated in tandem, do not impose any new obligations or costs on companies; they merely state the obvious, i.e. that we need to respect the acquis communautaire when it comes to protecting work and the environment."
"In the same vein, the position taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that contracts could contain terms to encourage the recruitment of minorities or excluded persons and combat employment, should be adopted unanimously."
"Now it has been agreed that employment policy needs to be mainstreamed, adopting this position would confirm that we believe and mean what we say."
"I am also encouraged by the new paragraph in Article 7 calling not just for a legal framework for protecting work to be defined, but for it to be aligned with Convention No. 94 of the International Labour Organisation and the directive on the secondment of employees."
"Meeting minimum labour standards in international conventions is one of the fundamental obligations of the developed countries in the European Union."
"Another question which we addressed was the question of thresholds."
"I think that, in doing away with thresholds, we really have warded off the danger of excluding small and medium-sized enterprises from the market, which is, of course, what would happen if they had to compete, with the complex procedures in the directive, with large companies at Community level."
"This amendment therefore helps employment and helps companies to remain viable."
"Finally, I call on the Commission to include other means in procurement by electronic means, not just the electronic auctions which are held on the market."
"By which I mean certain models of public procurement, such as electronic catalogues, electronic government purchasing methods and a series of corresponding electronic means used by companies."
"Mr President, procurement policy is a very important means of leading social development in the direction of sustainability."
"Local authorities and state organisations must therefore naturally be entitled to take account of the environment, the working environment and social goals when they procure goods and services."
"This is a right, Mr Harbour, and not a duty, even if you repeatedly try to present it as such."
"It is a right that local authorities must be given, with due attention having to be paid, of course, to ensuring that there will be no question of a distortion of competition."
"The EU has, of course, some splendid objectives in both the environmental and social areas but, if we do not integrate these objectives into all EU legislation, then little progress will be made and we shall not get anywhere."
"The public sector must be able to make environmental demands of the products it purchases, and it is particularly important to emphasise in this connection that it must be able to impose requirements upon such products throughout their whole life cycles."
"It is surprising that the EU' s own eco-label has been given so insignificant a place in the Commission' s proposal and, when the public sector prepares technical specifications, it must naturally be able to refer to the EU' s own eco-label."
"By means of a number of amendments, we have tried to integrate social and environmental considerations. I hope that, this time round, the Commission will take a positive view of this."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, for the considerable amount of work he had done on this most complicated and important issue, as many Members have said this afternoon."
"In May 2000, the Commission adopted two proposed directives designed to simplify and modernise Community public procurement rules."
"Those proposals contain significant new developments to adapt the directives to modern procurement requirements."
"In the interest of simplification, the Commission has proposed a recasting of four existing directives merged into two new ones."
"I note that Parliament has taken advantage of this recasting of the four directives to question the Community acquis in areas where the Commission has not proposed any changes."
"I refer here in particular to the amendments raising the thresholds, which will significantly reduce the directives' scope, above all - may I say to Mrs McCarthy - with respect to small and medium enterprises."
"If those proposals were to be adopted, the Commission would have to give serious thought as to whether the proposal should be retained at all."
"Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are to be welcomed."
"The Commission supports those amendments which add to the simplification and modernisation process."
"They are Amendments: Nos 1, 3, 167, 141, 4, 13, 16, 17, 24, 28, 34, 36, 174, 40, 50, 128, 53, 79, 80, 85, 88, 97, 109 - to the extent that it concerns production processes - and 112."
"The Commission can also accept the substance of a number of amendments, subject to some drafting changes, namely Amendments Nos 2, 10, 42 in part, 45, 46, 47, 123, 52 in part, 93 and 95 in part, 109, 110 and 154 concerning the extent to which environmental considerations can be taken into account at different stages of an award procedure."
"Similarly, Amendments Nos 11, 15, 48 in part, 51, 129, 52, 86, 87, 124, 89, 100 in part, 110 and 164 concerning the need to ensure that tenderers comply with employment law, can be included in the directive in an appropriate form."
"That is also partially the case for Amendment No 163 concerning information on sub-contracting."
"Various amendments designed to address the increasing centralisation of procurement are also acceptable, subject to some redrafting, namely Amendments Nos 5, 6, 20 in part, 126, 21, 41, 168, 172 in part and 175."
"In a similar vein, Amendment No 38 concerning consortia formed by contracting authorities and Amendments Nos 39 and 40 are also acceptable."
"A number of amendments add to the broad range of electronic means available to contracting authorities, namely Amendments Nos 23, 54 and 65 concerning reverse electronic auctions, as well as Amendments Nos 74 and 104, which deal with the integrity and confidentiality of data supplied by operators."
"Concerning confidentiality of data, part of Amendment No 31 can be accepted, though Amendment No 77 would then be superfluous and would have to be rejected."
"Various amendments concerning the competitive dialogue, in particular as regards payment of participants, can be taken into account, more specifically Amendments Nos 9, 56, 57 in part, 58 in part, 137 in part, and 138."
"Various amendments which I would describe as explanatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 7, 125 in part, 18, 142, 26, 30, 35, 46 in part, 70, 113, 114, 121, 132, 153, 169, 170 and 171."
"Subject to drafting changes, the substance of Amendment No 147 concerning the applicability of the Treaty below the thresholds is also acceptable, if placed in a recital."
"On the other hand, the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which call into question the Community acquis, detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex."
"Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following amendments:"
"Amendments to raise the directives' thresholds - as I said earlier - by 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directives a large number of contracts currently covered, namely Amendments Nos 32, 33, 67, 130, 101, 105 and 106."
"The unfortunate consequences of these amendments are not alleviated by Amendment No 147, however good its intentions."
"In fact, the raison d'être of the directives is not in itself sufficient without the detailed procedural rules of the directives to guarantee uniform and legally certain application and to safeguard the rights of economic operators through efficient remedies."
"Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of public contracts from Community competition, namely Amendments Nos 37, 38 in part, 122, 136, 150 and 157."
"Amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations, namely Amendments Nos 12, 14, 98, 134, 140 and 166 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic - and in particular social and environmental - criteria."
"Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement, namely Amendments Nos 70 in part, 73, 75, 102, 103, 115, 117 and 131."
"Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through the regulation of subcontracting and other requirements, namely Amendments 42, 48 in part, 49, 76, 100 in part, 116, 133, 152 and 159."
"Amendments which reduce transparency in calls for competition, in particular Amendments Nos 62, 68 and 78, and which extend the scope to negotiate, namely Amendments Nos 57, part of 61, 66 and 151."
"Amendments which restrict the use of framework agreements with no apparent justification, namely Amendments Nos 25, 27, 135, 139, 63, 64 and 158."
"Amendments introducing environmental considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directives, namely the part of Amendment No 45 concerning eco-labels, No 92 concerning the selection stage and No 109 regarding the definition of technical specifications and their compatibility with the environment."
"Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of the competitive dialogue, in particular Amendments Nos 55, 58 in part, 59, 60 and 160."
"Amendments containing additional cases where persons convicted of certain offences would face mandatory exclusion; in the proposed mechanism, only those cases subject to criminal sanctions in all Member States should be included."
"It is not, therefore, possible to take account of some of these cases, namely Amendments Nos 81, 82 and 83."
"On the other hand, some of these cases are already covered by the optional exclusions contained in Article 46(2)."
"Amendments Nos 84 and 90 should also be rejected, since they could lead to a situation where it is not possible to contract with a company which is trying to re-establish itself financially."
"Amendments which are superfluous or likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason, namely Amendments Nos 8, 19, 20 in part, 22, 29, 30 in part, 43, 127, 44, 45 in part, 55, 59, 60, 69, 70 in part, 71, 72, 94, 96, 108, 111, 143, 156, 162, 172 in part and 173."
"Amendments which, without justification, detract from the powers delegated by the legislator to the Commission under existing law, namely Amendment No 107."
"The last category of amendments not acceptable to the Commission as regards the first proposal are those amendments which remove clarificatory changes designed to create greater legal security, namely Amendment No 99 on the weighting of award criteria, Amendment No 100 on abnormally low tenders as a result of State aid, Amendments Nos 144, 145, 146, 148 and 149 modifying the definition of works contracts, and Amendment No 161 on the principles governing time limits."
"That is it as far as the first directive is concerned."
"As regards the second directive, the so-called Utilities Directive, it is the second proposal adopted by the Commission in May 2000."
"Besides the objectives of simplification and modernisation, which I just mentioned, this second proposal is particularly aimed at reviewing the scope of the directive in the light of ongoing or future liberalisation of the sectors concerned."
"This proposal is also a recasting of the existing texts, with the proposed changes incorporated in a single text."
"I can only repeat the misgivings caused, in particular, by the proposed amendments concerning the threshold values."
"Many of the amendments put forward will help make an important contribution to better procurement and are therefore to be welcomed."
"The Commission supports the amendments consistent with the line it has taken, such as Amendments Nos 2, 7, 21, 37, 43, 47, 95, 111 and 116."
"The Commission can also - although somewhat reluctantly - accept Amendment No 29, given the large consensus on this amendment in both Parliament and Council."
"Subject to drafting changes the Commission can equally accept the substance of a large number of amendments:"
"Amendments Nos 3, 18, 34 in part, 35, 36, 38, 40, 64, 87, 89, 92, 96, 99, 101, 118 and 119 concerning technical specifications, the possibility of taking environmental concerns into account at various stages of an award procedure and means of proving technical and financial capacity."
"Amendments Nos 4, 9, 44 in part, 56, 90 in part, 93, 97 in part, and 108 in part concerning observance of other legislation, in particular social legislation, clauses relating to the execution of contracts and provisions concerning sub-contracting."
"Amendments Nos 57, 59, 60 and 109 concerning exclusion criteria are acceptable in part to the extent that obligatory exclusions are limited to contracting entities which are public authorities and that the list of grounds for obligatory exclusion corresponds to that provided for under the Public Sector Directive."
"Amendments Nos 66 in part, 67, 68, and 69 regarding simplification of the provisions on mentioning the relative weighting of award criteria."
"Amendment No 70, depending on language versions as changes are not required for certain of them, concerning abnormally low tenders."
"Amendment No 76 on the coal and solid fuel sector is acceptable to the extent that it requires voluntary application of Directive 94/22 to be taken into account for the purposes of Article 29, however without such voluntary application being associated with any legal presumption."
"Amendments Nos 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, and 86 concerning increased transparency on remedies."
"Subject to acceptance of the substance of the Commission's proposal on Article 29 the Commission could also support Amendments Nos 13 and 16 concerning transferral of entities offering postal services from the Public Sector Directive to the Utilities Directive."
"The objective of allowing economic exploitation of coal-generated heat at the heart of Amendment No 15 will be taken into account through the acceptance of Amendment No 29."
"As drafted the amendment is not acceptable as it would have quite different effects from those intended."
"Concerning the issue of contracts awarded between related entities, Amendment No 27 is acceptable in part, as far as the possibilities of awarding service contracts to newly created, affiliated undertakings and of awards of certain service contracts to a joint venture are concerned."
"Amendments Nos 51 and 75 concerning preservation of confidentiality in respect of information forwarded by electronic means are acceptable."
"Various amendments which I would describe as clarificatory and which deal with a range of subjects are also acceptable, namely Amendments Nos 22, 30, 53, 113 in part, and 117."
"On the other hand the Commission has no alternative but to reject amendments which question the Community acquis, and which detract from modernisation of the directives or make the regime more complex."
"Accordingly, the Commission cannot accept the following:"
"Amendments to raise the directive's thresholds by approximately 50%, the effect of which would be to remove from the scope of the directive a large number of contracts currently covered or otherwise greatly reduce transparency; namely Amendments Nos 20, 46, 72, 102, 105 and 107."
"Amendments introducing new exceptions to the scope of the directives without appropriate justification, the effect of which would be to remove a number of contracts from Community competition; namely Amendments Nos 6, 19, 24, 25, 26, parts of 27, 28, 45 and 84."
"Amendments which would substantially change the conditions provided for in Article 29 and Annex X for the Commission to grant legally binding exemptions in the case of liberalisation having resulted in effective competition or which would create inconsistencies between this directive and other Community legislation: Amendments Nos 31, 58, 76 insofar as its inclusion in Annex X would create a legal presumption, and 77."
"Those amendments which undermine the very objective of public procurement rules, which is to ensure that public purchasers do not allow their decision to be influenced by non-economic considerations; namely Amendments Nos 8, 17, 65, 94, 104, 110 and 122 concerning award criteria which allow for the possibility of using non-economic criteria, in particular social or environmental criteria."
"Amendments which weaken attempts to modernise the directives by reducing the scope for using electronic procurement; namely Amendments Nos 49, 50, 73, 74 and 103."
"Amendments imposing disproportionate requirements on SMEs through regulation of subcontracting, in Amendments Nos 32, 41, 42, and amendments introducing social considerations into award procedures in a manner incompatible with the directive, namely Amendments Nos 33, 55, 62, 63, 71 and 88."
"Amendments on technical specifications either introducing environmental considerations in a manner incompatible with the directives or introducing improper requirements concerning equivalence of technical solutions; namely Amendment No 34 for the part concerning eco-labels, 36 for the part concerning costs, 39, 91, 98 and 100."
"Amendments which are not compatible with the flexible nature of this directive, which is applicable to both public and private commercial entities, and amendments transferring provisions from the public sector directive without good reasons, namely Amendments Nos 10, 11, 52, 54, parts of 59, parts of 60 and Amendment No 61."
"Amendments which are superfluous, would create significant legal uncertainty or are likely significantly to change the effect of other provisions in the directives without good reason; namely Amendments Nos 1, 5, 12, 14, 23, 48, parts of Amendment No 66 on the weighting of award criteria, 106, 112, 114, 115, 120, 121, 123 and 124."
"In my reply to Parliament and in view of the fact that Parliament deserves to have the opinion of the Commission on all the amendments which have been tabled, I see that I have been speaking for 24 minutes."
"I have some replies to question put to me during the debate but I fear that would take me far beyond the time allotted so I really am in your hands as to what you want me to do."
"May I suggest that I try to briefly answer the various questions that have been put and if you think I am speaking too long, please tell me so."
"Thank you for your comprehensive explanation."
"Perhaps you could offer us the answer in writing but summarise the main points."
"In reply to Mr Zappalà, I should like to say that the current definition of works contracts explicitly provides that such contracts may be for the sole construction or cover of both design and construction."
"To change that approach would in particular prevent or, at the very least, greatly hamper use of turnkey projects, public/private partnerships, works concessions and competitive dialogues."
"The Commission is, therefore, opposed to imposing a separation between the design and the execution of works."
"In reply to Mrs Schörling, the Commission has proposed including as possible award criterion the environmental characteristics of a product or service, provided that they present an advantage to the contracting authority."
"That criterion allows a public purchaser to evaluate the intrinsic qualities of the product or service and to award contracts to the most economically advantageous tender."
"The proposed amendments go further, in allowing more general environmental considerations such as the long-term effects on the environment of the products or services purchased to be taken into account at the award stage."
"Such considerations are not measurable; they cannot assist in an evaluation of the intrinsic qualities of the product or services and are therefore inappropriate at the award stage."
"In reply to Mr Rapkay and Mr Hughes, the purpose of the public procurement directives is to coordinate the procedures for the award of contracts and not to state which obligations - social or otherwise - private contractors must comply with once a contract is awarded."
"Contractors are in any event required to comply with all applicable laws and obligations, whether social in nature or not."
"However, the Commission is willing to state in the recitals of the directives that tenderers must comply with applicable social rules, including collective agreements of general application in performing public procurement contracts."
"The Commission also agrees that contracting authorities should be required to state in the contract documents the body from which information on applicable social obligations can be obtained."
"In reply to Mrs Hautala, I should like to say that regarding the preliminary reference currently before the Court of Justice, the Commission has taken note of the conclusions of the Advocate-General."
"However, those conclusions cannot prejudge the judgment itself."
"In addition, having regard to the content of the communication on the environment and public contracts, the Commission - as it explained at the time of the Court hearing - does not see an obstacle to the emissions criterion being taken into account where this involves - as the case of the city of Helsinki has shown - an external cost to the purchaser itself."
"The Commission will, therefore, wait for the Court's ruling and reconsider interpretation in the light of the judgment and, if necessary, will consider revising its position on the amendments from the European Parliament."
"I should like to reply to Mr Lehne but, as he has left the Chamber, I shall skip that part of my reply."
"Commissioner, it is true that Mr Lehne is not here, but please feel free to respond anyway."
"Your responses will then be conveyed to Mr Lehne."
"This is a broad debate which reaches much further than the people involved."
"Mr President, the Commission is always pleased to assist Members of Parliament in forming their opinions."
"May I therefore say that if Mr Lehne had been present I would have said the following - and I am, of course, willing say it even though Mr Lehne is not here."
"Mr Lehne stated that social and environmental clauses must be introduced in the tender documents themselves and should not influence the choice at the award stage."
"Therefore, I would support his view that Article 53 on award criteria should not be modified."
"Such considerations may be taken into account at the appropriate stage, either in the tender documents or in the contractual clauses."
"I cannot support Amendment No 147 by Mr Zappalà, since it will not provide any legal certainty to economic operators."
"May I end my reply to Parliament here and conclude by saying that there is now a real need to ensure that our public procurement rules remain relevant to increasingly sophisticated procurement requirements."
"That is why Parliament and the Council must now press ahead to ensure that these directives are adopted at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, I am sorry for having spoken for fully half an hour, but I feel that Parliament is entitled to a complete response to the many amendments tabled."
"The Commission awaits the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, in view of the importance of the matter, I would just like to ask the Commissioner to clarify something."
"In any case, I would like to thank him for all his comments, which were certainly important from my point of view, although I do maintain - and I will do so tomorrow - that Parliament should have the autonomy to decide on a political basis rather than on the basis of other factors."
"However, his response regarding Amendment No 147 does not make sense at all: while the Commission is against raising the thresholds - which, as was said during the hearings, meetings and debates within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I believe is because it wants the directives on works contracts to be applied as widely as possible - according to what the Commissioner has just said, raising the thresholds would actually reduce the number of works contracts."
"Now then, Amendment No 147 seeks specifically to open up works contracts to competition, and I cannot understand why the Commission is opposed to this."
"I would be grateful to the Commissioner if, either now or later in private, by some means or other, he could explain to me what part of Amendment No 147 is unacceptable."
"It is important, Mr President, for this is no trivial matter."
"I repeat, if it is not appropriate to do so now because it is time to suspend our work or move on to something else, I am quite prepared, if the Commissioner agrees, even to meet him afterwards so that he can explain to me what is wrong with Amendment No 147, which, as I see it, ensures that absolutely all works contracts, of whatever type, can be governed by European legislation."
"Mr President, I shall try to be brief."
"Until 1971 the only rules and principles applicable to public procurement were those enshrined in the Treaty itself, and in particular the provisions of Articles 28 and 49."
"However, experience has shown that the genuine opening up of markets and the creation of a real and efficient internal market required that those rules and principles be clarified through detailed provisions coordinating national procedures."
"To revert to the legal situation of the 1970s - and this would be the result of the proposal just made and enshrined in Amendment No 147 - is not acceptable, especially in a proposal aimed at modernising the legislation."
"Moreover, to do so would also deprive economic operators of one of the most important advances in the field of public procurement, namely the possibility of enforcing their rights through efficient legal remedies guaranteed through the two specific directives which govern remedies in respect of contracts falling within the scope of the public procurement directives."
"Therefore, the introduction of Amendment No 147 simply does not make the amendments aimed at raising thresholds throughout the directive acceptable."
"There is still some misunderstanding."
"I believe we can find a bilateral means of solving this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Ozone in ambient air"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0454/2001) by Mr Davies, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air [PE-CONS 3658/2001 - C5-0524/2001 - 1999/0068(COD)]"
"Mr President, I had not followed the last report in any detail but if Commissioner Wallström is in the same sort of mood as Commissioner Bolkestein, I am glad I am not tabling any amendments today."
"On a complete change of note, a few weeks ago I was reading to my daughter, Kate, from A Christmas Carol by the 19th-century British author Charles Dickens."
"Scrooge sat in his counting house, he wrote."
"""The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air."""
"It must be a great cause for cheer in European cities today that we no longer have to breathe that ""palpable brown air""."
"It is a sign of environmental progress and achievement that air quality now is better than it has been for centuries."
"But there is more yet to be done, and in its Clean Air for Europe programme the Commission has identified particulates and ozone as two priorities for action."
"Ozone pollution contributes to the premature death of tens of thousands of people each year; it causes breathing difficulties, coughs, headaches and eye irritation."
"The World Health Organisation has not been able to identify a threshold below which there are no effects."
"It can also damage vegetation, reduce crop yields and stunt the growth of forests and, like acid rain, it can eat into and destroy the fabric of buildings and works of art."
"And so we have this draft directive to address the problem."
"It started out as a remarkably weak proposal, the key element of which was to set targets for 2010 for the maximum number of exceedances above WHO guidelines, but these targets would not have been binding on Member States."
"It also called for the preparation of short-term action plans to deal with acute problems and for more public information and health alerts."
"During the course of the past two years, Parliament has been able to use its codecision powers to give this legislation some teeth."
"We have strengthened the public's right to information."
"We have made it easier for recalcitrant countries to be named and shamed into improving their performance."
"We have ensured that damage to materials is included amongst the criteria for consideration."
"We have re-emphasised our wish to see long-term reductions in ozone levels achieved by 2020 in line with the National Emissions Ceilings Directive proposals."
"But above all, we have addressed the issue of the non-binding short-term targets."
"Instead of Member States having to work to achieve these ""as far as possible"", which was the original proposal, we have insisted that effective measures shall be taken unless the targets cannot be achieved by ""proportionate measures""."
"I want to emphasise that we agreed this wording because both the Commission and our own legal services advised us that it would make the provisions of the directive enforceable and that Member States could be taken to the European Court of Justice if they failed to take such measures."
"In other words, we have used our codecision powers to transform a statement of good intent into a legally binding commitment."
"Even so, the European Environmental Bureau has criticised us, asking: ""Why do we need a directive at all if the 2010 targets are not fully binding?"""
"But this misunderstands the nature of ozone pollution. It is hugely transboundary."
"While peak exceedances are falling across Europe, the average level is continuing to rise, almost certainly as a result of pollution generated far from our shores."
"I do not believe that Spain, or Italy, or Germany, or any of us should face the prospect of legal sanctions because they are being polluted from China."
"That would not be fair and it would not be realistic."
"I want Member States here to be required to do all that they can realistically to meet the targets, no more and no less."
"I think that ""palpable brown air"" gave a lot of character to the story of Scrooge."
"But it is not appropriate now."
"Perhaps I will ask my daughter, Kate, if she will write a 21st-century version featuring clean air."
"However, with the assistance of the Commission and the last Belgian Presidency, Parliament has been able in the meantime to use its negotiating powers to turn a simple wish list into a requirement for our various governments to take action which will significantly improve air quality across Europe."
"We have secured greater changes and a more ambitious directive than we could reasonably have expected when the draft was first proposed."
"We can be proud of what we have achieved."
"Mr President, the directive on ozone in ambient air is intended to provide a response to the problem of tropospheric ozone produced and trapped in the air around the earth' s surface which, as we all know, has damaging effects on both human health and on the planet' s vegetation, ecosystems and on the environment as a whole."
"The concentration of ozone, as we know, is due to the accumulation in the atmosphere of precursor agents, but there is no easy solution, of course, to eradicating them, because these precursor agents sometimes act to reduce ozone in the atmosphere."
"Various measurements taken at national level have shown that, in climatic conditions such as high luminosity and a stable atmosphere, reducing the precursor agents does not produce the desired effect of reducing the concentration of ozone."
"In fact, it does the complete opposite."
"Therefore, the solution to the problem of ozone concentration is extremely complex and simply shutting off the sources that generate precursor agents is not an appropriate measure. An example of this would be closing down a factory chimney that emits smoke, which is a precursor agent of ozone, into the atmosphere."
"The rapporteur and various members of the Committee on the Environment - including myself - have been working intensely for almost two years to both improve the Commission' s proposal, which was undoubtedly necessary, and also to achieve a balanced proposal that would ensure maximum compliance by the Member States."
"Lastly, in October, a joint text was produced, which was then approved by the Conciliation Committee."
"I should like to emphasise a very positive aspect of the proposal that has been adopted, which is the combination of long-term objectives with a short-term approach to these high-risk situations, and all the measures designed to ensure rigorous control and monitoring of ozone levels in the atmosphere in all Member States."
"I also think it is important to apply the principle of transparency where information is concerned, since the population must be more and better informed about the incidences of ozone levels in the atmosphere."
"Another important aspect is the consideration of meteorological conditions and comparisons between the various Member States, which must lead to information being provided so that we can monitor developments in this issue in the various Member States."
"This directive represents a major step in the right direction, providing a balanced approach to the problem of contamination and, together with the directive on national emission ceilings, we feel that these will genuinely prove to be very important tools with which we can address environmental problems and especially the problem of contamination in a cross-functional way."
"Mr President, thank you first of all to Commissioner Wallström and Mr Davies for the good work they have done on this matter."
"Specifically where ozone is concerned, we are of course in an odd situation."
"High up in the atmosphere, the ozone layer is too thin, which causes problems, including health problems. Down here on earth, on the other hand, the concentration is, of course, far too strong."
"I think, however, that we have obtained a good result from the conciliation negotiations and, in actual fact, probably a better result than many of us had dared to hope for when we listened to some of the Member States' negative attitudes towards solving the air quality problem with which we are concerned here."
"Together with the Directive on National Emission Ceilings, for which Mrs Myller, here beside me, was rapporteur, this directive makes an important contribution to securing a lower concentration of ozone in Europe and, especially, in the large cities of Europe."
"I think it is good that we have been given a starting point in the form of the WHO' s assessments of the existing risks to health and to the environment."
"We have got some partial goals established, or target values for 2010, and these must be met."
"However, it is naturally cause for concern that, for many years, we shall be obliged to accept that the WHO' s thresholds are being exceeded to a certain extent on a certain number of days per year."
"I therefore think it good that we also obtained agreement to there having to be some more long-term objectives, in terms of which the WHO' s target values must be complied with."
"What was agreed was not quite so precise as we should have liked here in Parliament."
"A reference point was set for 2020."
"Many of us should have liked to have seen 2020 become a more definite deadline for meeting the WHO' s recommendations."
"I also believe it is good that the Member States should not only be obliged to prepare practical programmes for achieving the targets, but that obligations should also be imposed in terms of informing people about the programmes that are being prepared and about the results - both positive and negative - that are obtained, just as we have acquired a number of rules as to when people are to be notified that there are problems with the unduly strong concentration of ozone - both people in general and people belonging to groups which are especially sensitive to problems in this area."
"Finally, I would say that I also think it is good that we have got the candidate countries on board so that they can be involved early on. We can of course now look forward to the directive' s coming into force before the first candidate countries accede to the EU so that, even at the time of their accession, they will have to comply with the obligations imposed by the directive upon existing Member States."
"I hope that, by means of this directive, we can prevent and reduce the harmful effects of the unduly high concentrations of ozone upon people' s health and upon vegetation and that today might prove to have been a good day for future air quality in Europe."
"Mr President, I believe that the Directive, which is now in its third and final reading, will improve air quality in Europe."
"It amends the 1996 Directive so as to meet the national emission ceilings for atmospheric pollutants and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation."
"The work of Parliament in the drafting of the Directive was significant, and so once again our warm congratulations go to Mr Davies and to our other colleagues who were involved in this process, which lasted over two years."
"In addition, we need to give our special thanks once again for the work of Belgium as Council President."
"In the Directive which has now been approved, the Member States are obliged to submit plans which will allow the limit values necessary for the protection of human health and of vegetation to be lowered by 2010."
"2020 will be the benchmark year for long-term objectives and for the subsequent revision of the Directive."
"In special risk zones, short-term action plans plus active and open information and publicity work are also required."
"From the point of view of this Directive, it is of particular importance that an attempt be made to also involve all the candidate countries at as early a stage as possible, since the distance impact of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds on lower atmosphere ozone levels is significant."
"In Finland for example the greater part of the ozone present in the lower atmosphere originates from transboundary pollution, in other words from emissions which our country could, in reality, hardly influence at all without the European Union."
"Mr President, as you have personally remarked, we have arrived at the half-way point in Parliament's fifth term of elected office."
"Parliament has already at this stage of its term been able to exert significant influence on the improvement of the air quality in the Union and the candidate countries."
"In the environmental field, Parliament has thus used its new and enhanced authority in a good and responsible manner."
"This work needs to be continued, the Commission must be encouraged to be more ambitious when drafting its proposals, and the good cooperation developed with the Council in the field of the environment needs to be kept as warm and effective as it is at present."
"Mr President, I am of course very pleased that we are now approaching the time when we can adopt the Directive on ozone in ambient air."
"Thanks to this directive, we shall be able to protect vegetation and people' s health from the damaging effects of unduly high concentrations of ozone, except in those cases where that cannot be brought about by proportionate measures."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Conciliation Committee' s joint draft from 11 November 2001."
"As has already been pointed out, the directive has been improved on essential points in the process from common position to final directive."
"It has become clearer and more consistent, and that has been possible thanks to the high quality of the European Parliament' s proposal and of the successful negotiations during the conciliation."
"I wish quite simply to take the opportunity of conveying my special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Davies, and all the members of the Conciliation Committee."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Sixth Community Environment Action Programme"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0456/2001) by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme [11076/1/2001 - C5-0434/2001 - 2001/0029(COD)]."
"Mr President, with regard to the Sixth Environment Action Programme I would first of all like to offer thanks to the 'shadow rapporteurs' of the various Parliamentary groups for their fine cooperation."
"This cooperation with the 'shadow rapporteurs' has meant that the voting agenda, at least, looks very different than in the first reading: we have concentrated exclusively on the most important amendments."
"I hope that this fine cooperation will also continue in the voting tomorrow."
"The Commission, too, has been a good cooperation partner: we have held a great many discussions."
"Our special thanks go to Sweden, which acted as President during the first reading."
"The main objective of the programme, of course, is to integrate environmental policy with the other sectors of policy."
"In this respect this forms a continuation to the Fifth Environmental Action Programme, but in the course of this integration we must attain concrete objectives and actual results, and then we will also need structural amendments, for example to the Commission's own actions."
"The objective of integration is of course that the environmental aspect be taken into consideration in the various policy sectors themselves."
"Special emphasis must be given to the areas of energy policy, transport policy, agriculture and fishing, since these are the most difficult areas from the point of view of the environment."
"The future agricultural reform must take steps in the direction of more sustainable procedures, and the new instruments for improving the state of the environment must incorporate a clear focusing of the EU's aid policy on the environmental aspect."
"The conflict which presently reigns over subsidies from the environmental point of view must be eliminated."
"An inventory should be established of environmentally-damaging subsidies, and these must be phased out by 2010 at the latest."
"Money, incidentally, can act as a fine consultant, and in this spirit environmentally-related and energy taxes (for example) must also be developed."
"I am also very pleased that here in Parliament we have been able to give very broad approval to the idea that environmentally-related taxation needs to be developed also at EU level."
"Qualitative and quantitative objectives, and timetables, must be set for the most important environmental problems."
"This has been a very contentious question: the Commission has not supported this, and the Council also has doubts."
"My own opinion is that in this type of programme it is very important to understand those requirements which are to be placed on decision-making from the environmental point of view."
"By setting objectives and by dividing them sensibly over time periods, we will make it possible for political decision-makers to understand, at any given future stage, what sort of decisions must be made in the situation at hand."
"In my opinion these objectives are required, in particular, as instruments for directing policy."
"The Commission proposes thematic strategies, which will subsequently guide the environmental policy of the future."
"The Commission suggests six; Parliament has added an urban thematic initiative, and this has been very largely approved."
"The thematic strategies must be approved using the codecision procedure."
"In my opinion this is quite self-evident, since it is through these strategies that we will be directing environmental policy in its crucial aspects."
"As I stated, there are very few amendments; but I would like to say a few words about one of them."
"This is the amendment by the European Liberal and Democratic Party group concerning rejection of the common position."
"In my opinion this will not be of any benefit to this matter, nor do I understand its content; it is only by improving the common position that we will bring about improvements in European environmental policy."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, for having, at first reading, voiced the concerns of the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions."
"Given the daily practice of this Committee, these could only be concerns relating compliance with this legislation, as raised in some of the rapporteur' s amendments and compromise amendments."
"All policies should be integrated into environmental policy - as stated in some of the amendments - and public participation and information is necessary - also as stated in some of the amendments."
"I am not hiding the fact that, as a citizen of a small mining region in Asturias - and I am speaking here in a personal capacity and not on behalf of my group - that I have some problems with the amendment on imposing a time limit on subsidies for projects that could damage the environment."
"I do not have a problem with it in general terms, but specifically with regard to the fact that, in the region in which I live, more than 30 000 jobs have been lost as a direct result of restructuring. For this reason I do not agree with these amendments."
"However, we completely agree with the rest of them."
"We also agree with some of our fellow Members - and I am sure that my colleague Jonas Sjöstedt would support me here - that this latest proposal is not the one put forward by the European Parliament."
"This is a proposal that was debated, on which agreements were reached between all of the groups and between the rapporteur and the Commission and the Council to arrive at this latest proposal that we have here."
"For this reason, I also agree with the rapporteur that we cannot accept, and shall reject, the amendment from the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform party that suggests rejecting the proposal."
"The proposal is highly important, Mr President."
"The Fifth Community Environment Action Programme has come to an end."
"The European Union needs a clearly defined strategy with commitments and specific timetables for the next few years and it seems to me that this is potentially a clearly defined proposal with commitments and a specific timetable, which, indeed, we have a great need to implement."
"Mr President, I am pleased to say that, at this second reading, the parties have worked to bring their positions closer together."
"And although the Council and the Commission have made an effort to accept the many amendments from our first reading, I think that we can now say that it is Parliament that has made the effort to try to find, and reach agreement on, common positions."
"In this regard, the role of Mrs Myller deserves a special mention."
"We think that this is a reasonable programme that allows the Commission to work, makes it possible to legislate and allows States to be flexible within viable programmes, and for this reason we feel that we must support it."
"This is an appropriate framework for combining the development of European communities in a pivotal policy of sustainable development and I think that it is up to the task."
"If carried out in this way, it should be clear in conciliation that certain areas are subject to the principle of subsidiarity."
"I would also like to talk about principles."
"The desire to see all methods used everywhere and to implement a uniform policy in all States runs counter to the principle of sustainability and belongs to the globalist mindset."
"It is very easy to attack globalisation when talking about the economy yet not to want to call imposing the same rules on the whole world globalisation."
"Social principles, technological viability and the context in which methods are applied are all of great importance to sustainability; the first principle of sustainability is to know how to combine general principles with the imposed rules to suit the needs of each community, each location, each climate and each context."
"We must be sufficiently generous of spirit to give those in government the freedom to impose their own rules, something that we shall also continue to do, and to adapt them as they see fit."
"Furthermore, we support a scientific policy and feel that the function of the Popular Party and of Parliament, in this case, is to support the Council and the Commission because codecision is not only Parliament' s right, but also a responsibility that should be used to help governments."
"For this reason, for example, we respect the dates of all these agreements that the Commission and the Council are to conclude with other European countries."
"We need to be serious in this regard and support this policy that has required such efforts to produce."
"We support the thematic strategies and a more scientific policy precisely because this means adapting to the current state of affairs, adapting to the situation of a particular State, sector and to the issue at hand."
"We have to assess whether suitably adapted and applicable technologies exist, for in many instances, due to the climate, particular conditions, or size of a company, for example, technologies can differ. The results, however, should be the same."
"Therefore, we support the scientific nature and the study of the economic and social impacts that the programme will have, because without social principles, there can be no sustainability."
"For this very reason we are not in favour of simply revising subsidies, that is to say, of a target date being fixed whatever the subsidy may be, and this is particularly the case for specific sectors that have had to close due to measures dictated by the Commission, which has imposed laws upon them - such as in the coal sector, for example - that are now facing the problem of some criteria being applied more strictly than others."
"Let us first define the criteria for negative subsidies and take account of the fact that five years is not a sufficient amount of time for a generation to recover nor for certain deprived areas to regenerate."
"Moreover, we reject the principle of substitution, because it offers no guarantees to industry, to the citizens, or to society, and lends itself to a very free interpretation by certain sectors, countries, civil servants or experts which may lead to the establishment of measures that are damaging to society and that have no legal guarantee."
"And the principle of legal guarantee is inherent to the Rule of Law."
"I hope that this scheme of management can be implemented."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Myller who, for a long time now, has had the task of working on this action programme and has fought resolutely to enable us to get it into order."
"It is splendid to know that we are at last at the stage at which we are to adopt a position on the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"In view of this, it is not perhaps so surprising that many of us wish, and had wished, that the programme might have been better and feel disappointed that it is not as good as we would have liked."
"At the same time, we perhaps also feel some kind of frustration concerning the unfair distribution of power we sometimes seem to perceive between the institutions, and wish in some way to express this specifically in the case of the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"I should therefore like to see liberals and others who are reflecting along these lines pull themselves together and rise above their own frustrations."
"Let us differentiate between policy and processes and do what we have a mandate for. Let us do it well and take the institutional and constitutional battle elsewhere and not where the Sixth Environment Action Programme is at issue."
"Let us see what kind of thing the Sixth Environment Action Programme is and see what we are to use it for, namely as a guiding star in all EU policy -environmental and otherwise- and as a lynchpin of the entire sustainable development strategy with which we shall travel together to Johannesburg in September of this year."
"There is no reason for rejecting this document."
"We must adopt it today."
"Regarding Mrs Myller' s reference to the common environment tax, I would make a point of mentioning recent reports in Sweden to the effect that the dramatic fall in the quantities of climate-changing gases is due precisely to the carbon dioxide tax."
"This further supports the case for our having to continue the fight, together with the Commission, to ensure that the Council is convinced that now is the time for us to introduce a common environment tax, especially where carbon dioxide is concerned."
"Mr President, we held our first debate on the Commission' s Sixth Community Environment Action Programme in May last year."
"At the time, the Commission proposal came under heavy attack from us as the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"In our view, the programme was far too broad and showed a serious lack of priorities."
"At the same time, we wondered whether a ten-year plan was really, in fact, outdated."
"We are now eight months further on, and have had input from the Commission, the Council and Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Any satisfaction or progress?"
"No, unfortunately, neither."
"The proposal, as it was presented at the time, has since been cut down to the bone."
"The position of the Council of Ministers is deeply disappointing on all fronts."
"Last time, I used the image of a Christmas tree, trimmed with a multitude of proposals, which devalued the entire text."
"The current plan has more in common with an empty box than a Christmas tree."
"The form is just about presentable, but is very much lacking in content."
"I can tell you straight away who is not to blame for this."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Myller, has done sterling work, and the Commissioner has made every effort to tighten up the plan and take the wishes of this House more into consideration."
"However, it is the Council that has frustrated every substantial improvement to the proposal."
"It is staggering to realise that when we, as Parliament, vote on the plan' s current version, we shall in fact be back to square one, and this after two years of hard graft on the part of the Commission and Parliament."
"Can this be justified to the European citizen?"
"They set great store by the environment."
"It is now the Council that has destroyed all the good work that has been done."
"So what should have been done instead?"
"According to my group, the priorities that are completely lacking in the plan are climate change, energy, waste and bio-diversity."
"In addition, the plan should have been much more concise and should have been characterised by far more cohesion and vision."
"In our view, the Council is best summed up as an emperor without clothes."
"He may seem unremarkable at first glance, but fails the test upon further inspection."
"This is not a strategy, it is even less than existing policy in a pleasant format."
"It therefore constitutes a step back, and we propose to reject the present proposal in its entirety."
"Mr President, those who work on environmental issues and on a variety of measures, programmes, conventions, items of legislation etc are often surprised and impatient at how slow the process is and at how difficult it is to specify in concrete terms how objectives in terms of protecting the environment and public health are to be formulated and implemented."
"That is also how it has been with the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"First of all, it was not certain that we should obtain any action programme at all."
"When we then saw the Commission' s proposal, we thought that it was extremely vague and lacked both qualitative and quantitative objectives and timetables."
"An environment action programme must naturally establish environmental objectives if there is to be any point at all in having a programme."
"Mrs Myller, as rapporteur, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have genuinely tried to improve the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur for this and also thank other fellow MEPs for their valuable cooperation."
"When we are now about to adopt a view on the Council' s position at second reading, we see that the Council has in fact introduced a very great many of Parliament' s amendments."
"When it comes to specifying deadlines etc, things are still extremely sluggish, however."
"We must now take the opportunity of changing this by voting in favour of the committee' s amendments and the compromise amendments tabled by quite a few political groups."
"The programme' s overarching aim is to decouple, for example, environmental pressures from economic growth."
"Up until now, the improvements that have been made have been offset by increased production and consumption."
"Another general principle is to supply the basis and the priorities for sustainable development and to apply the precautionary and substitution principles."
"So that it is possible to do this, I should like to recommend all MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment No 44, which of course requires it to be discovered by no later than 2003 which forms of EU aid run directly counter to our aims, that is to say have a negative effect on the environment, and requires the year to be established by which this aid must be abolished."
"Where chemicals and pesticides are concerned, I think that all the amendments tabled on this issue are sound."
"The chemicals organisations' umbrella organisation, CEFIC, has taken the view that the amendments are not in accordance with the report on chemicals strategy."
"I maintain that this view has just been plucked out of thin air."
"It is sad that such an incomplete and one-sided analysis has been carried out."
"As rapporteur for the White Paper, I can assure you that these amendments are sound and that they strengthen the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"When it comes to the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, we should, in common with Mrs Hulthén, have liked the programme to have been more vigorous and have liked to get more measures through."
"The proposal is not now to be altered, however."
"There is so much we must do and agree upon within these institutions. That is why I would definitely wish to reject the ELDR' s proposal and call upon everyone to vote in favour of the proposal by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and of the compromise amendments that have been tabled."
"Mr President, I must first address the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to reject the common position."
"That is a proposal which we cannot support."
"We think it would be irresponsible not to take a decision on the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"I too should have liked the proposal to have gone much further."
"The original proposal was extremely weak and also vague."
"The fact is, however, that some of what Parliament contributed has been incorporated into the joint proposal."
"We shall therefore have the opportunity tomorrow to introduce a great many of the quantitative objectives and timetables we actually want to see."
"We must not pass up that opportunity."
"We must put this proposal in its context."
"During the period that this environment action programme is to apply, the European Union will be enlarged through the accession of a large number of new countries."
"There is a danger of this causing a number of problems in terms of environmental work too."
"There is a danger of the work' s losing momentum, and it may become more difficult to push through new environmental laws."
"It would not be particularly wise to do without environment action programmes at such a stage."
"So that environmental work does not lose momentum, it is no doubt desirable to have a programme with timetables and practical objectives to adhere to when enlargement takes place."
"My group will vote in favour both of the committee' s proposal and of all the compromise amendments we arrived at in these negotiations."
"We do not think the situation is perfect, but we think it is acceptable."
"I wish particularly to mention Amendment No 10, which I think is important."
"This concerns the European Investment Bank."
"There were quite a lot of MEPs who voted against this amendment in the committee."
"I find that incomprehensible because it is an amendment which goes to the very heart of integrating environmental considerations into other policy areas, something that the European Investment Bank has not been successful at doing. What is required of the bank, namely that it take account of the environment, ought to be self-evident."
"That is why it is so important for them to receive the clear message that they too are not exempt from what is required."
"The same applies to chemicals policy, where we want to see strict wordings."
"Mr President, not for the first time in this House I have the opportunity to express concern with regard to the safety of nuclear installations, and in particular those with an established record of poor management, since they put the lives and health of millions of citizens at risk."
"Such is the case with the British government's nuclear installation at Sellafield."
"This is not just my view: the litany of management blunders and serious technical defects is a matter of public record, which has been exposed, despite efforts to keep it secret."
"It is inconceivable that the British Government should set out to justify not only the continuity of Sellafield in its present dangerous condition, but also wish to add further to its operations by commissioning the MOX processing facility."
"Because of its closer proximity to Ireland than to most parts of the British mainland, the Irish Government has again raised serious objections to the continued operation of this dangerous plant."
"Records in this House will show that on a previous occasion I called on the Commission to exercise its powers under Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty in relation to verification of nuclear installations at Sellafield."
"In reply to queries from my political group, the Commission recently confirmed that the last time it undertook such an audit was in 1993, nearly a decade ago."
"Bearing in mind the number of times that this matter has been raised in the House by all political groups, how can the Commission possibly justify its silence and inactivity on a matter of such serious public concern?"
"I call on the Commission to immediately initiate an examination of all activities on the Cumbria site and ask the Commissioner to give assurance to that effect in his reply."
"Mr President, by bringing together several sectoral directives such as those on climate change and waste management, the Commission is seeking to launch an innovative programme to improve the environment."
"The end result is a real labyrinth that is incomprehensible to the citizen."
"However, the Council has again adopted a more realistic position by not setting a binding timetable or target."
"So what does the rapporteur want?"
"Is it realistic, for instance, to incorporate the substitution principle, which currently has no political or legal definition?"
"There are also issues surrounding environmental crime, environmentally related taxes and legislation on environmental responsibility."
"We should also be in step with the resolution that was adopted last November relating to chemicals."
"These issues, which are crucial for our economy, cannot be dealt with hurriedly within the framework of this report."
"I am also concerned by the emphasis placed on biodiversity, with the headache involved in setting up the Natura 2000 network, both in France and elsewhere."
"The approach to this subject is not correct either and there are alternatives."
"We shall therefore vote in favour of rejecting the amendment as a whole."
"Let us remain realistic and pragmatic."
"Let us go back to the main aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, namely to ensure a high level of protection, taking into account the subsidiarity principle and diversity in the various regions of the Community."
"To do this, in my view, is already a fair challenge."
"Mr President, I hope we can get agreement on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, preferably without going into conciliation."
"I would like, on behalf of the committee, to thank Mrs Müller for the immense amount of work she has put into this report."
"I underline my support for the amount of work she has done because I actually disagree with many of the conclusions she has come to."
"Nevertheless, we have dealt with this matter so extensively that we will probably not gain anything by extending the process to the full beauties of late-night conciliation in Brussels."
"The amendments tabled by the committee and the rapporteur do not really add up to anything of substance and, where they do, the results would probably be to damage the chances of success of the Environmental Action Programme."
"I draw your attention to Amendment No 11, which is already out of date."
"I would criticise, as Mr Bernié has done, the reliance of the rapporteur to a considerable extent on jargon."
"Old war horses are trotted out again and given one more exhausted run around the course."
"The chemical industry is focused on as the villain of the piece and the substitution principle makes a well-earned reappearance in the amendments that the committee has asked the House to consider."
"The assumption of at least Amendment No 1 - and to some extent Amendment No 30 - is that the substitution principle exists as a fully worked-out concept."
"It does not."
"It is an amalgam of assumptions and suspicions fudged together by the green movement as a universal panacea."
"The amendments talk of this as a fully worked-out policy, but we should at least be consistent."
"The Schörling report, which we voted on a few months ago, called on the Commission to produce a definition of the substitution policy principle, so we can hardly deal with it now as though it really is in existence."
"Do we need a Sixth Environmental Action Programme?"
"I do not share the cynicism and despair of some in the ELDR Group."
"Some sort of route map or check list is helpful and desirable."
"The Commission probably built on previous mistakes by attaching so much weight to the idea of a programme."
"The poor Commissioner wanted a slim programme and has ended up with a fatty!"
"I also regret - and she may regret - the submission of the programme to full codecision because that has certainly lengthened the process without adding to the substance."
"The best part of the Environmental Action Programme for me is the concentration on better implementation."
"In the old days we wanted an action programme in order to put pressure on the Council to agree to legislation."
"Now the trouble is that the Council does agree to legislation and then does very little about it."
"Without better implementation we are deceiving the people of Europe into believing that things are getting better and better, in the words of the old Labour Party advertisement."
"Just as at home in UK things are not getting better and better, the words remain easy to say but they are often not followed by action and it is up to us to see that they are."
"Mr President, I have a speech here, but I must admit that Mrs Jackson has rather distracted me into thinking about how things get better and better after you reach a certain age."
"Clearly Mrs Jackson has reached that certain age and she now thinks everything in the past better than it is now."
"Like Mrs Jackson, I also wish to thank the rapporteur for her good work."
"This document is worth voting for, but it would be more worthwhile voting for if it contained a few more of Parliament's amendments."
"In the field of chemicals policy, the field of preserving biodiversity, climate change, transport and the protection of air and water quality, there are clear and worthwhile proposals that could be built upon in the conciliation process."
"In the field of fiscal policy, there are some serious and sensible suggestions in Parliament's amendments."
"However, the setting at the moment of any kind of European-wide environmental taxes must be better thought out."
"At the moment it is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a whole series of very different nuts, with what I would guess would be very limited success."
"We must now as a Parliament unite and tomorrow morning take the next step into conciliation, where we are going to have to work together with a view to achieving a common viewpoint to the way in which we are going to protect the environment of our common European home and preserve it for future generations."
"I look forward to taking that step tomorrow morning and to the Christian Democrats helping us to do so."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Myller. She managed to get an excellent report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I have to be honest."
"The Council proposal is weak, lacks any imagination, any specific goals and is a welter of words."
"My criticism is also levelled at the four Green Ministers who may have promised progress, but who failed to deliver."
"Neither can the proposal as it now stands be used as propaganda material for young people, as Commissioner Wallström stated."
"This is why it should be binned, and the large majority of my group will support the amendment of the Liberals to reject the common position."
"It is the political choice of the two large groups, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"If they vote against and reject the amendment, they too will be responsible for this weak and empty concoction."
"Needless to say, the Greens will support all amendments to improve the proposal."
"A one per cent reduction in greenhouse gases annually, certification of wood, sustainably-produced and otherwise, the amendment to which the GUE made reference, the European Investment Bank, the chemicals policy along with the substitution principle."
"Mrs Jackson, I have to get this off my chest."
"These are not the inspired ramblings of a Green mind, they are existing policy in Denmark and Sweden, and even the new Danish government, that is from the right-wing school of thought, has no intention of changing this policy."
"The amendments, which include a legal framework for voluntary agreements between industry and the European Commission, are all sound, but I have very little hope that they will obtain the required 314 votes."
"This means that, ultimately, the officials of the European Commission will get their way, the same officials who proposed the policy not to present a Sixth Environmental Action Programme under any circumstances."
"This is why this is a defeat for politics and for European environmental policy."
"And the key culprit is the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, prompted by certain officials from the European Commission."
"But it is still not too late."
"Tomorrow, we will vote, and I hope that maybe some of the Christian-Democrats will see sense and will be prepared to vote for a number of sensible amendments, so that maybe we will end up with a conciliation procedure, which will have some substance at least and which will not merely be a welter of words."
"Mr President, ever since the 70s, we, in the European Parliament, have been in the habit of using environmental action programmes to give direction to environmental policy."
"This was very relevant in those days, for we had to start more or less from scratch."
"A great deal was subsequently achieved, but I am now increasingly feeling uncomfortable."
"The evaluation of the Fifth EAP has clearly shown that we are up a blind alley."
"Partly because many Member States have failed to implement environmental legislation, the objectives of the Fifth EAP have not been achieved."
"Since we are unable to draft a programme that adds value to what we are already doing in the environmental sphere, I wonder whether we should continue drafting environmental action programmes."
"I will for this reason support Mr Maaten' s amendment to reject the Council' s common position."
"This is no reflection on the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, or the Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, but is about the Council' s role."
"Let us now focus on the actual implementation of the Fifth EAP."
"What will matter most are the implementation of, and compliance with, current environmental legislation, especially in the light of enlargement."
"Mr President, presenting a common position for second reading could be seen as a purely technical, tactical move to bring us closer to implementing the decisions."
"However, in this debate, as many other speakers have said too, a number of key points still have to be defined."
"Indeed, although the Council has incorporated most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading, the Sixth Framework Programme lacks specific working time frames and its strategic objectives need to be defined in more practical terms."
"We must not forget that this programme will have to operate over a decade or so, and so an approximate work schedule and poorly defined aims are completely unacceptable."
"In particular, the European Parliament' s latest amendments call for more decisive, tougher action against the danger of pesticides - this applies both to the present Member States and those waiting to join the Union - again, there must be a substantial effort to combat the greenhouse effect, the increasing sound pollution that pursues us all the time, wherever we go, the too frequent environmental disasters caused by human negligence, disasters for which it is becoming increasingly difficult to find out who is responsible."
"Lastly, once again, the European Parliament' s amendments seek to make some of the proposals already mentioned practical reality. I just want to summarise them under at least four basic headings, four areas which have been defined as priorities: climate change, biodiversity, the connection between the environment and human health, and waste disposal."
"These issues are so vitally important that anything less than total precision and total responsibility on our part would be absolutely unacceptable, and we cannot put off dealing with them to a later date as the Council seems to want to do."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, and also the shadow rapporteurs, especially our group's own, for the work done on this report."
"I consider neither the Commission's proposal nor the report presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be worthless."
"I do not, therefore, quite understand the proposal by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens that the proposal and the common position should be rejected in their entirety."
"Another reason why I do not understand it is that, if I understand rightly, the Member States' environment ministers are not exclusively Christian Democrats but, rather, primarily Greens and also liberal Social Democrats and members of our family of parties."
"To be sure, we often have to criticise and improve what the Council submits to us but, in view of this political constellation, it is somewhat problematic to say that it is all nonsense."
"Despite our criticisms, we have to improve on the Council's proposal without completely rejecting it."
"In particular, I would call upon us to produce some stringent wording concerning subsidies that have harmful effects on the environment."
"The Council's wording strikes me as too weak."
"I believe that, whenever it is said that the protection of the environment costs money, one has first to bear in mind that, of course, the destruction of the environment and its consequences cost money, and that it is even worse when the destruction of the environment is being subsidised - in other words, when money is being paid out for it."
"There are possibilities there for very effective savings."
"I therefore emphatically support the idea of reducing subsidies."
"The Committee has now decided on 2005 as a deadline."
"A lot of people have problems with that, and not only in our group."
"That is why there are various proposals for compromise."
"I believe, though, that we must, whatever happens, agree on an amendment that is more stringent than what the Council has decided on."
"We should also not put other economic instruments, such as a fiscal reform, to one side, but should follow them through at a European level."
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is an exciting journey that is being undertaken with a proposal for a new Environment Action Programme."
"It has been extremely instructive."
"Clearly, a certain comfort has sometimes been found in the fact that you have, at all events, had kind and friendly things to say about both myself and the skilful rapporteur."
"Possibly we should have talked rather more about what was expected from the Sixth Environment Action Programme as early as when you questioned me."
"We perhaps should have straightened this out at an earlier stage, for I can see that this debate embraces many incompatible and rather contradictory desires."
"We appreciate that a programme may be needed that extends over a longer period because environmental problems often arise after a certain number of years."
"We also need a longer planning period if the measures we take are to be the right ones."
"On the other hand, we should of course very much like to draw up practical measures and objectives because it is in that way that we can put pressure on the Member States."
"We cannot, however, just come up with credible objectives for a ten-year period."
"The programme states the overarching objectives, and it is of course extremely important for us to know that this is the direction in which we must be moving."
"At the same time, we are concerned here with a programme of action and of measures to be taken, and that is what we have aimed at."
"We must state how we intend to set about achieving the objectives, while the practical objectives and deadlines must be incorporated into, respectively, the thematic strategy and the various draft laws and other proposals we submit during this ten-year period."
"The idea behind the programme was not, then, just to continue with the same thing and add a long list of legislative proposals to those which were already in the Fifth Action Programme and which, moreover, as Mrs Jackson quite correctly said, fail very often to be implemented properly."
"That is something we must get to grips with."
"It is, however, also important to emphasise what we in actual fact agree about, that is to say the overall structure and the priorities."
"It is a question of daring to say that these four issues are the most important."
"It is also a question of the underlying principles that are to govern environmental policy during this ten-tear period and of the need to consult widely and to have broad participation in decision-making on environmental issues."
"We agree on which issues are to be highlighted: climate change, the natural environment and bio-diversity, health and environmental measures, and the issues of how we use our natural resources and dispose of waste."
"We also agree that current legislation is to be fully implemented in practice, that environmental considerations are to be integrated into all other policy areas and that legislators, decision makers and the general public must have access to adequate information."
"The strategy for the next ten years is in actual fact based upon the Fifth Environment Action Programme, which has been developed by means of a description of how environmental policy and its challenges have altered."
"Current patterns of life and consumption, the way in which goods are produced and the way in which we live and operate as private individuals affect environmental problems."
"The environmental action programme is challenging."
"I am aware of the fact and accept responsibility for it."
"Even though there has been some tough criticism, I believe it is right to dare to tackle something new and try to find a new structure."
"For me, it was important to design an environment action programme which everyone, and not only the experts, can follow and assess when new proposals are made and initiatives presented, as was the case for example with the recent climate package."
"That is why I do not of course agree with rejecting the Council' s common position."
"Now that we have carried out all this work, we ought surely to try to complete it and help each other as far as possible."
"In principle, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy offers its unqualified support for the general approach to developing future environmental policy that forms part of the Council' s common position."
"Of relevance here too are the requirements that policy must be based upon participation and dialogue and upon the best possible scientific findings that are available."
"That means that we must be very thorough in analysing the problems we face, together with possible solutions, at the same time as studying current research and making use of indicators etc. In that way, we shall create policy through solid work, and that will be in accordance with the strategic orientation of this programme."
"It also means, as I said, that it is meaningless to introduce objectives and guidelines into the programme more or less arbitrarily."
"At the same time, I want to avoid possible misunderstandings and explain clearly that I do of course support the use of clear objectives and deadlines."
"Moreover, our proposals will include these, and they must be discussed in both Parliament and the Council."
"The few overarching objectives the programme now contains are generally known, and so they should be."
"I am also, of course, able to approve the additional objectives proposed by the Commission in its communication on sustainable development prior to the Gothenburg Summit, that is to say Amendments Nos 11, 15, 16 and 27."
"That is, however, on condition that they faithfully reflect our communication."
"I cannot approve the incorporation of other objectives into the programme, as has been done in Amendments Nos 17, 24, 25, 26, 34 and 42."
"It is also gratifying that the committee supports the idea of, and proposal for, thematic strategies, together with the proposed content of these."
"The committee has added a proposal on the urban environment."
"This is to be found in Amendments Nos 32 and 33, which are acceptable overall."
"We thus have a stable platform for future work and cooperation."
"The problem is that the proposal that the strategies should be ready to implement within three years is in conflict with the requirement for best scientific findings and for broadly based consultation and participation."
"We should also remember that we have seven thematic strategies to deal with."
"In the light, too, of Amendment No 12, requiring all thematic strategies to be subject to the co-decision procedure, this means that the Commission must present all the thematic strategies by no later than the end of the year so that there is time for the co-decision procedure."
"We can perhaps meet the deadline for some isolated thematic strategy, but scarcely for all of them."
"That is why I would call upon the European Parliament not to push this issue too hard."
"Give us an opportunity to develop the strategies and to put forward a package of measures that is best suited to the current problems."
"We cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 41, but I shall keep the European parliament informed of our work on the thematic strategies, and we shall submit oral reports each year in order to fulfil the requirement in Amendment No 14."
"I must inform Parliament that I am opposed to most of the amendments concerning chemicals."
"The problem with these is that there is no agreed definition of the principle of indemnification."
"We should therefore examine this carefully before we make it legally binding."
"Naturally, I believe it has its part to play, but before we make it legally binding we must arrive at a definition which is tenable."
"Regarding the proposal that the REACH Register should include all existing substances and that all products, unlike substances and preparations, should be labelled, all I can say is that it would be practically impossible."
"We are nonetheless able in principle to approve Amendment No 31 on the coordination of the work involving chemicals and pesticides, even if there is already such coordination."
"Regarding the issue of voluntary commitments and agreements, we see these as part of an advantageous mix of various political tools including, for example, legal and financial tools."
"According to the OECD, there are more than 300 agreements in the Member States of the Community."
"They differ considerably from one another, depending upon how flexibly they are adapted to different situations and objectives."
"The Commission plans to submit a communication examining the potential of such tools."
"It is too early to determine what the agreements under the programme will look like, and we cannot therefore approve Amendments Nos 9 and 40."
"There is general support from the Commission regarding quite a number of other issues, for example sustainable development and integration, measures affecting tax rates at Community level, environmental crimes etc."
"In addition to those I mentioned earlier, the Commission is able to support Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 18, 19, 21, 39 and 45, together with parts of Amendments Nos 43, 46 and 47."
"I cannot however accept the other amendments tabled."
"We are close to reaching an agreement on the Environment Action Programme for the next ten years."
"Mrs Myller' s efforts as rapporteur at this second reading have been much appreciated."
"No repetition of the debate is required because her amendments have been carefully selected, something which bodes well for the next step in the procedure."
"I hope that, on the basis of the amendments supported by the Commission, the Council will adopt a positive approach to Parliament's opinion so that those of us in the Commission, the Council and Parliament, in conjunction with other interested parties, can together continue with our work on conserving and improving our environment."
"Thank you for an interesting debate."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Integrated product policy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0419/2001) by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission Green Paper on integrated product policy [COM(2001) 68 - C5-0259/2001 - 2001/2117(COS)]"
"Mr President, I must confess I was pleased to see you come in, because I was practically under the impression that I was going to be the only person in the Chamber."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner, who, after a hard day, is here with us this evening."
"The Green Paper on an integrated product policy should, in my opinion, be the framework for the formulation of a series of guidelines and proposals that will enable both producers and consumers to make full use of the instruments and opportunities offered by the market to be able to make it function in a way that is better adapted to the practice of sustainable development."
"This new approach needs to be an improvement on the traditional approach that the European Union has been following up to now, which is essentially based on encouraging environmental improvement in the production sector through standards that establish limits for pollution and also through voluntary instruments that promote the differentiation of companies and products that incorporate environmental improvements."
"We have to admit, with regard to these voluntary methods, which have been implemented since the early nineties, such as the co-determination regulation, European eco-audits and the ecolabel, that these have not been as successful as had been hoped and, above all, have not been implemented in a similar fashion in all Member States."
"Only 3 200 companies throughout Europe have obtained EMAS certification and only 350 products from 70 companies have these European 'ecolabels' ."
"In my opinion, the main cause of this situation lies in the rigidity of the system and the still weak consumer demand for 'green' products."
"The Commission, aware of this problem, has presented this Green Paper on integrated product policy, with varying degrees of wisdom and balance."
"It has been widely discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I, naturally, maintain that the Commission has shown considerable dedication to the matter."
"Various mechanisms have been proposed with the aim of stimulating the necessary environmental improvement of products and their consumption."
"The proposal contains a series of suggestions that would facilitate the implementation of different policies and market instruments that go further than those that focus exclusively on the environment and that, I think, will make it easier for a future White Paper to be more detailed and better developed."
"We are faced with the need to adopt a decisive approach to stimulate environmental improvement in the EU market, which will allow products to be given prices that are fairer from an environmental point of view, to stimulate demand that is more appropriate and to make the use of instruments for clean production more widespread."
"Furthermore, I believe that this approach will give greater impetus to the integration of environmental policy in other areas, such as the economic or social areas, and with this we will be better able to fulfil the mandates of Cardiff and Gothenburg."
"Though the amendments that Parliament has tabled, it has brought a greater degree of precision and clarity to the Commission proposal with regard to the orientation of the IPP and also to the role of each of the actors - companies, public authorities and consumers - and has given very clear consideration to the issue of shared responsibility without this involving a decrease in producers' responsibility, but instead taking into account and also putting an emphasis on the responsibility of both public authorities and consumers."
"Public authorities, for example, can provide a very important boost for a more environmentally friendly market though public procurement."
"They can also point out useful market instruments to put the IPP into practice: economic instruments, such as tax incentives, for example."
"Similarly, the Parliament text highlights the importance of an improved and enhanced eco-label, the need to improve European standardisation processes, the need to set parameters and indicators that are simple to apply and similar in all Member States for the lifecycle of products, not forgetting the need not to endanger free competition in the market or in European companies."
"The text also highlights the crucial role of information, which should be clearer, more truthful and easy to understand."
"I think that I have accounted for the majority of amendments tabled in Plenary."
"I have accepted them and I have only rejected those that I feel do not fit into the framework or context of a Green Paper."
"In my opinion, this is a good proposal that deserves all our support."
"Mr President, while there are certainly elements worthy of praise in the Green Paper, overall we are left with the impression of a lost political opportunity."
"The Commission has strong institutional powers, which it could use to actively drive the IPP process."
"Too often we are left with the impression of a Commission that is a spectator rather than a powerful actor."
"We also need more joined-up thinking, more explicit connections between the IPP project, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and the Strategy for Sustainable Development."
"We would like to see those links made much more explicit."
"To summarise a number of the other concerns raised by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we believe that the strategy tends to rely too heavily on voluntary agreements."
"They clearly have a role to play, but they are not a substitute for regulation; they should be seen as complementary to it."
"At the very least we need very clear benchmarks, objectives and timetables for any voluntary agreements so that we can ensure that they are working."
"The Green Paper also focuses almost exclusively on products rather than services and therefore misses another whole raft of potential opportunities to green an increasingly large area of our economies."
"Perhaps one of the major shortcomings of the Paper is its insufficient awareness of the broader international trade context, under which, unfortunately, some of its proposals would have questionable legality."
"The effectiveness of the IPP strategy will be severely curtailed unless the Commission explicitly recognises the reforms that would be needed to the World Trade Organisation in particular, to enable its measures to be set out."
"Similarly, with respect to public procurement, greening public procurement is vitally important but there are currently obstacles in achieving that which should have been acknowledged more explicitly in the Paper, along with strategies to address the problem."
"It is very significant that in its opinion the Committee of the Regions specifically refers to the restricted scope of local and regional authorities for action when it comes to green procurement and notes that legal action has already been taken against a number of towns and cities which have tried to implement a green procurement policy."
"Those are the kinds of areas that need to be changed."
"We look forward to an ambitious new White Paper in the near future."
"Mr President, this report walks a tightrope between the need to increase production of consumer goods and services and environmental protection requirements."
"I welcome the Commission' s proposal and the rapporteur' s tough, practical, calm handling of the subject."
"Each product has a life cycle, which starts when it is made available to the consumer."
"When the consumer uses it, the product' s environmental sustainability - a rather complex term although now universally understood - immediately becomes part of the equation."
"The relationship is delicate and it does not end with the use or end, so to speak, of the product' s life."
"Indeed, the most serious problems often arise when the product ceases to perform its function and needs to be disposed of, pensioned off, in other words eliminated from the world in which it has performed its function."
"It is at this point that the most critical environmental implications come into play, for not all products can be disposed of using the same technology, nor are they all hazardous to the same degree or all biodegradable to the same degree."
"That is why the Commission is proposing an initiative which deals with the problem at source: if a product is to be easy to dispose of at the end of its lifecycle, this must be taken into consideration right from the design stage, and this is where the greatest merit of the report lies."
"Here, then, is the proposal to create incentives to encourage initial research on how to keep manufacturers better informed of the technologies and raw materials available to this end."
"The proposal does not overlook a factor which could give rise to opposition from manufacturers: cost."
"The text states in quite practical terms that, in addition to encouraging the provision of aid to producers who will face greater costs if they supply these biodegradable goods, a pricing policy also needs to be established allowing manufacturers to set different prices on the market and, moreover, why not, allowing variable taxation to be introduced as well."
"In other words, those involved in protecting the environment, who are therefore helping us, deserve some support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we manufacture products, but what do we do with a product when its life cycle comes to an end?"
"The Green Paper is about answering this question from an ecological point of view."
"So far, in my opinion, we have been giving inadequate answers to this question, with well-known consequences: substantial detriment to the environment by production and the use to which products are put, with associated detriment to the health of workers and consumers."
"Rather than carry on with this policy, we should get serious about one that is integrated."
"In that way, we shall be able to make financial savings and will not need to eliminate environmental damage."
"For these reasons, too, we need a strategy for the development of more environmentally friendly products and services."
"The report before us, completed by the amendments adopted in Committee, provides a good framework for a product policy on ecological lines."
"The Commission proposal for the discussion process in Committee was of little help, though."
"The statements made in this text were couched in vague terms, there were no evident structures for further action, nor was there any evidence of a coordinated discussion process."
"I do not think that any entrepreneur or consumer is going to be won over to an environmentally friendly product by such a hotchpotch of proposals."
"The Commission must see to it that the statements made in its forthcoming texts are of greater clarity."
"What is important to my group is that the environmental costs as a whole should be reflected in the prices of products."
"Tax incentives should also be guaranteed so that disadvantaged consumers can also buy environmentally friendly products."
"European product standardisation must be involved to a greater extent, and services should also be made subject to environmental criteria."
"Another option for the creation of a market for environmentally friendly products would be, for example, the use of economic guidance instruments."
"We should monitor their use and the effect they have, and it is vitally important that we should ensure that EU environmental legislation is not neutralised."
"In view of the unsatisfactory text produced by the Commission, the rapporteur has done a good job, but further action must not be limited to contributions to discussion."
"We urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products."
"Producers and consumers must be made sensitive to the various aspects of environmental quality."
"This report is a start, but the real work on its content remains to be done."
"Mr President, I must not be especially critical, but try to look ahead to a future White Paper rather than discuss the rather odd draft Green Paper."
"Within the safe food sector, where most of my work is done, a 'farm to fork' principle, which is very effective when attempts are made to legislate and to try to see the connections, has now finally been arrived at following a host of scandals and disasters."
"I should like the White Paper to be based on approximately the same principle so that each product can be traced and seen in its context: finite or renewable raw materials, the supply of energy, what form of energy is used, chemicals, the flow chart for the product, logistics etc."
"This is especially important for very large volumes of products, consisting in actual fact of food, water and household chemicals."
"These account for more than half of the consignments transported on our roads and consume an incredible amount in terms of resources, despite our perhaps not even thinking of them as products."
"I am therefore looking for a strategy in which everything is traceable and in which we can track a product' s history, and for principles that are valid whether we are talking about a car or a packet of sausages for lunch."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for its resolution on the Commission's Green Paper and just remind you that it is a Green Paper, the start of the debate on integrated product policy."
"In particular I would like to thank Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo being such a committed rapporteur on this challenging and difficult issue."
"I would also like to thank you for your speeches."
"I would agree with a lot of what has been said during this short debate."
"In reducing the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle, the objective of IPP is fundamental to addressing our environmental problems."
"For this reason IPP is a key measure within the Sixth Environment Action Programme and the Sustainable Development Strategy also underlines its importance."
"The difficulty we face is that there are so many products on the market today, products that often have long supply chains involving many different actors."
"Because of this it is impossible to develop a ""one size fits all"" instrument."
"Instead we need a variety of instruments and exactly which ones depends on what is most effective at each point in the supply chain."
"They can be both voluntary and mandatory."
"I agree that voluntary measures should be complementary and we should make sure that they are not the only instrument used."
"When thinking about IPP at European level, we should also recognise the experience gained in several Member States - Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Italy, to name but a few- over the last few years."
"There is, therefore, widespread acceptance of the concept and interest in it."
"In 1999 the informal Environment Council asked the Commission to come forward with a Green Paper on the issue."
"I therefore delivered this paper to start the debate on what form the European IPP should take."
"The reactions to it from the 130 stakeholders who submitted comments were generally positive, but what came back was what has been reflected here, namely that it is sometimes seen as being too fluffy and not really an understandable concept."
"But it sounds nice, as they say, and in general the opinions of the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions were favourable as well."
"The Green Paper suggested a strategy and tools for making a European IPP a reality."
"Many such tools already exist - public procurement legislation, European eco-labels and EMAS, to name but a few."
"In other areas we will have to be innovative and think of new instruments."
"The Green Paper sought to canvas the views of stakeholders on the way forward."
"The Commission did this not just because it wanted to develop the best possible policy, but also because IPP needs the active involvement of all stakeholders to succeed."
"Your resolution concludes this stakeholder consultation process and will enable us to develop the White Paper."
"From your resolution and the comments from stakeholders it is clear that the White Paper needs to start with concrete environmental problems."
"This is what we have learnt from this discussion."
"Issues such as climate change, hazardous chemicals and biodiversity affect us all."
"If we take environmental problems rather than instruments as our point of departure, we can better convey the idea that IPP is more than just a collection of tools, something that we perhaps did not do sufficiently in the Green Paper."
"We have to link it to concrete environmental problems to describe how to use these instruments."
"This is also what Mrs Paulsen referred to."
"These tools will still be important."
"We need to continue developing them because we cannot address millions of products individually."
"However, I too am coming to the conclusion that we need to focus our actions on particular products and sectors."
"You rightly make this suggestion in paragraphs 24 and 25 of your resolution."
"We will also need to set out the strategy for implementing IPP and its advantages and the Commission will need to consider carefully the measures within IPP's scope as well as how it relates to other policies."
"It is my intention to ask the Commission to adopt this paper during the second quarter of this year."
"Thank you, Commissioner Wallström."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Europe and Space"
"The next item is the report (A5-0451/2001) by Mr Alyssandrakis on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Commission communication to the Council [COM(2000) 597 - C5-0146/2001 - 2001/2072(COS)] and the European Parliament on Europe and Space: Turning to a new chapter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this European Commission proposal is about developing a space policy not at the level of individual Member States but at the level of the European Union."
"It was drafted together with the European Space Agency and proposes three lines of approach: strengthening the foundation for space activities, enhancing scientific knowledge and reaping the benefits for markets and society."
"The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes these lines of approach and acknowledges the overall benefit of developing space activities."
"In fact, the development of launch systems is prerequisite to any other space activity."
"We can build in this sector on the experience and technical know-how which the Member States have acquired over several decades, especially from the Ariane launch system."
"The second line of approach is a perfectly natural one, in that space is an ideal place for carrying out research which cannot be carried out on earth, such as astronomic research into radiation which cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere, research under conditions of zero gravity etc."
"The third line of approach is very broad and covers everything we call space applications."
"These applications range from satellite telecommunications to navigation and earth observation systems and have become an integral part of our daily life."
"I should like to stress here that, if mankind is to benefit from space activities, then space must not be used as a platform for strategic competition."
"It is highly significant, in my view, that the committee report emphasizes in the very first paragraph that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes."
"I am particularly worried by the amendment proposing to add the phrase ""which purposes may include strategic applications within the context of peaceful operations"" ."
"If we adopt this amendment, we shall be opening the door to all manner of strategic activities in space, provided they are cloaked in the mantle of a ""peaceful operation"" and we have seen plenty of them on earth over recent years."
"In short, this is a Trojan horse that will change the tone of the report and allow all hell to break loose."
"I call on all my fellow Members to keep to the Commission text."
"I also propose that they adopt Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 from Mr Souladakis' s opinion."
"I must stress that taking a stand against the militarisation of space is terribly important, especially following the recent decision by the United States' government to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Agreement and its insistence on developing the so-called anti-missile shield."
"I tabled Amendment No 5 because I wanted to put the implications of this action on the record."
"May I also point out that, in my personal opinion, certain aspects of the proposed GMES programme involve strategic activities."
"The application of space policy is also the subject of this debate."
"The European Space Agency has operated on a transnational basis on our continent for several years now and has played a pivotal role in developing the space activities of European countries."
"It is therefore only natural that there should be close collaboration between the European Union and the European Space Agency and we have already reaped rewards from this collaboration."
"The committee report notes the role of the European Space Agency and proposes that it be integrated into the European Union in the long term, but without losing its independence."
"I must say that I personally am against this."
"What worries me is that, if this happens, the European Space Agency will lose the independence which has helped it emerge as a global player."
"International collaboration is a sine qua non in the space sector and the committee report refers favourably to it, stressing the need for international collaboration to be developed not just with the Russian Federation, the United States, China and Japan, but also with less developed countries for which the European Union could provide access to space."
"Finally, I should like to raise the subject of funding."
"As we all know, access to space has its rewards but does not come cheap."
"Ôhe Sixth Framework Programme for funding research classifies space and aeronautics as a priority sector."
"That may show willing, but it is not enough."
"We do not just want a more general commitment, we need a more general commitment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is important to the future of the European Union's space policy."
"I trust that the direction taken in the final vote will be to the benefit of our nations and mankind as a whole."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has examined the Commission proposal and basically agrees with its approach."
"However, it notes that the CFSP is dealt with as an economic and development issue rather than as a defence and safety issue, with all that implies for Europe."
"This is in all probability due to the fact that the CFSP is still under development."
"In this sense, I suppose that this proposal will mature at the next stage, as far as foreign policy and defence systems are concerned."
"As far as the content is concerned, I have several comments to make."
"First, there is a medley of policies in the Member States, which need to be more or less unified."
"Secondly, on the question of the strategic use of space: the strategic use of space is unavoidable de facto, but it must be used for peaceful purposes such as Petersberg-type tasks."
"In all events, our committee is opposed to the type of strategic mentioned in the famous Star Wars policy."
"It will, nonetheless, need to be used for missile interception installations in space and during wars, which destroy satellites."
"Having said that, I believe that we need to push forward with this policy, on which we agree, our criteria being that these methods must be used for peaceful applications, policies must be unified and any action taken must be integrated into a single European policy because, in the final analysis, Europe must not be dependent for its safety, communications and security on the satellite systems of either the United States of America or Russia."
"In this sense, quite apart from the fact that this initiative is of interest from a development point of view, it will also be of political interest and must therefore be considered crucial to the common foreign defence and security policy of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by thanking Mr Alyssandrakis for the good work he has done with us."
"Ever since Lisbon, we in Europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world, and technology and science are of course part of that, although I am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday, but of advanced technologies such as, for example, telecommunications, earth observation and ecology."
"Europe must - as the past demonstrates - concentrate its strengths in these areas."
"Airbus and Ariane, based in Toulouse, are showpiece projects, demonstrating that Europe, if it concentrates its strengths, is capable of competing on a global scale."
"Industry is becoming ever more concentrated, and what counts here is the creation of European structures linking the European Union, the ESA and the Member States, which will facilitate more effective cooperation across the board."
"Thought should, though, also be given to international cooperation beyond Europe."
"Here, I am thinking not only of the USA, but also of Russia and China."
"Any European research policy should of course be of the sort that is also likely to attract the rising generation in this sphere."
"I am myself from the aerospace industry and have been given to understand that fewer and fewer young people have been studying these subjects in the last few years."
"We should be tackling that ourselves and not looking to immigration as we do in other areas."
"We also need clear objectives in this area, though; hence the urgent request to the Member States to vote clearly in favour of Galileo."
"Industry, too, should break new ground here."
"It is important to the future that not only State bodies should take on responsibility, but that industry should also contribute to the development of services that the citizens can use and that are also capable of being marketed."
"In conclusion, I would like to deal with an important point that has been mentioned, namely the so-called militarisation of space."
"I do not think that Europe should be developing a 'Star Wars' programme, but I find the idea of equating any military use of the infrastructure with SDI highly dubious."
"After all, we do not speak of the militarisation of telecommunications just because the German Army uses the telephone."
"We want a European foreign and security policy, we want a Rapid Reaction Force, we send soldiers to other countries, and these troops must receive the information they need."
"So we should indeed be thinking at a European level about becoming independent in this area and capable of using our own infrastructure in the future, so that we can do what our responsibility for our own soldiers and our political responsibility in this area require of us."
"I therefore ask for support for the amendment that Giles Chichester and I have brought in."
"We really cannot talk here in terms of an SDI; on the contrary, this is a sensible use of the infrastructure in Europe's interests."
"Mr President, I join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Alyssandrakis on his report on the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament on Europe and Space: Turning to a new chapter."
"This is not the first report that Mr Alyssandrakis has drawn up on the subject of space and, I suspect, not the last."
"The Socialist Group will be supporting the report."
"We believe that space has important civil and industrial applications."
"Europe cannot afford to be sidelined."
"Europe cannot afford to allow the US and the other space powers - Russia, China and Japan - to leave us behind."
"We need to develop further the technological basis of space activities, in particular launchers, to move eventually to European independence."
"On the way to European independence we may have to work with those trying to catch up with the US's enormous lead."
"We therefore welcome the statement in the report that space research is one of the priority themes for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and development."
"Europe, unless it gets an unequivocal agreement with the United States that it can have access on all occasions to the GSP system, will have to work with others inside and outside the European Union, in industry and government, to develop its own independent system."
"We can support the amendment from Mr Chichester to the effect that we can include military applications for peacekeeping purposes."
"At the same time we support the rapporteur's own amendment, Amendment No 5, which deplores the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deplores the development of national missile defence, which we believe will trigger a new arms race in East Asia."
"To make our position absolutely clear, we are also willing, if Amendment No 1 is passed, to support the rapporteur's Amendment No 2, to the effect that we believe space should be used to create peace rather than conflict."
"We do not see these as contradictory but rather as establishing a limit beyond which we do not wish to go."
"I hope that in the vote tomorrow we achieve what we intend, as I have set it out this evening."
"I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to focus on just one key issue in the short time that I have, namely the dangers of the militarisation of space."
"Many European citizens are deeply critical of the proposed US national missile defence system, which they rightly see as an offensive system which is certain to start a new and costly international arms race."
"How much more concerned would they be if they realised the aims of some of their own politicians and legislators?"
"I do not mean people here, but there are others who have ambitions to launch their very own, home-grown European Union programme to militarise space."
"That is what some people would like to turn the European space programme into."
"We need to send a very clear message with this report, to make it absolutely clear that any use of space should be solely undertaken for peaceful purposes and in accordance with international law."
"I therefore welcome in particular the emphasis which Mr Alyssandrakis has given to this in his report and appreciate the amendments he has tabled to strengthen these aspects still further."
"It follows that I also very much regret the amendments by the PPE Group, which again introduces that idea of using space for military applications."
"Although I accept that this has been put in the context of what are called peacekeeping operations, I am still concerned that this is the start of a slippery slope."
"I am very happy that Mr Radwan does not want to see an EU Star Wars, but I am very concerned that his intentions could be misinterpreted: that other people could see peacekeeping in a different context from the one that he sees it in."
"We need to remember as well the context of the report released by the European Space Agency in December 2000 in which the so-called Three Wise Men looked into the future of ESA and concluded and I quote: ""Embarking on development of a European defence system, including a space component, will provide a significant part of European public investment."""
"That report went on to say: ""We see it as logical to use the capabilities of ESA also for the development of more security-orientated aspects of European space policy."""
"All this adds up to the very real possibility that the European space policy will adopt a very specific military component and therefore it is timely and urgent to send a message with this report that we want to keep space for peace."
"Mr President, I add my compliments to Mr Alyssandrakis for his report and the work that he brings to this particular field of our committee's activities."
"My first observation is that the use of space for research and for commercial applications is often overlooked in the wider world because it is not as dramatically exciting as projects like the Apollo moon landings, yet it is extremely important, as this report emphasises."
"I welcome the objectives set out in the communication for European policy."
"I confess I particularly like paragraph 10, which calls on the industry to do more about commercial exploitation of space."
"That is an important way ahead."
"We want industry to be very much involved in the exploitation of space."
"It seems to me that this report is something of an appetiser - or hors d'oeuvre - for the Galileo report, which we will be considering next month in our Strasbourg part-session."
"Paragraph 12 in particular refers to Galileo as being part of the European strategy and to its importance for transport."
"We should take careful note of that."
"We have to recognise the difficulties in obtaining funding for space exploitation, space research, space utilisation."
"I particularly welcome also the reference in the report to the need for international cooperation drawing in other powers and partners."
"I come back to the question of using military applications for peacekeeping operations."
"To be realistic, we need funding from defence budgets for space projects in a number of fields."
"We should not be frightened of drawing on that source of funding for applications intended for peacekeeping."
"That is very important to emphasise."
"I regret that Mr Alyssandrakis has taken fright at my reference to military applications."
"He should take more note of the phrase ""peacekeeping operations""."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Galileo Galilei's words, 'and yet it does move' can be applied to European space policy's present situation."
"I have my doubts, though, when I see the downright interminable tug-of-war about the establishment of Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo."
"So I am all the more pleased that there are some first positive signs that European space travel is to be given new momentum, something that is urgently necessary if Europe is not to lose its connection to this important and forward-looking high technology sector."
"Whether the systems we are working with are for communication, navigation, or observation, satellites play a decisive role."
"We should not make the mistake of comfortably relying on the existing systems of other, even friendly, nations."
"We should rather be demonstrating our own capabilities in this field, which is the only way that we will have reliable operational freedom and that European industry will have a chance of a healthy future."
"I speak from my own experience, having on several occasions been Parliament's rapporteur on the European satellite navigation system."
"In Europe, the potential we have in this field is so valuable, that we should not simply leave it unused."
"'Tackle it!' must be our watchword."
"A political signal is indispensable."
"The first stage on this road is the drafting of a coherent strategy for space travel policy, and the Commission has done very good work on this."
"I emphatically support the proposed lines of action."
"Europe must accord space travel more importance in future."
"Let me sum up my priorities for European space travel in a conceptual pairing that may perhaps seem paradoxical: independence and cooperation."
"Independence means our own strength, autonomous structures and jobs geared to the future."
"Cooperation, on the other hand, represents the strengthening of the EU's relationships through compatibility and exchange."
"Space travel should be given new impetus."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Alyssandrakis on this excellent and authoritative report, which urges us to put in place a Community space policy."
"That said, given the progress made on Galileo, I think that we are still a long way short of the target and that we must not give up what we already have for something far less certain."
"In other words, the intergovernmental method is now proving that it is working better than the Community method."
"This is because, throughout the world, space development cannot be achieved unless a number of conditions are in place."
"First of all, we must not be afraid of public support, funded from the public coffers."
"The market can fund not everything...not American rockets, not Russian rockets, not French rockets."
"Secondly, the military funds a large part of civilian resources; let us not beat about the bush."
"If we refuse to accept a dual system, we will have great difficulty in launching the space industry in Europe, given that, as you have seen with Galileo, the pacifism of this House is, at the end of the day, a gift to American militarism."
"I think that we must also have this set out very clearly in our minds."
"The Americans said that they do not want Galileo because it is incompatible on a strategic and military level with GPS."
"Lastly, we must also have a genuine industrial policy."
"However, I do not think that we are fulfilling these conditions as yet."
"This is something that I regret, but we must move in this direction if we eventually want the European Union to be the space power that it should be and that it must be if Europe wants to maintain a high level of technology."
"As a final point, I would like to say that I think if we want to move forward in this area, we must strengthen our cooperation with those who want to move in this direction and leave behind those who do not want to."
"And this is not simply for the sake of Galileo, it is also for the future of a European space policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this report, which indicates the way forward that will enable us to open up a new phase in European space policy."
"I wanted to speak about space today because this is a subject close to my heart and because I am lucky enough to live in Toulouse, where, as Mr Radwan said, everything is connected to aeronautics and space."
"Two of the world' s largest sub-contractors in the space industry are based in Toulouse and much of the work of the European Space Agency in France is carried out in the National Centre for Space Studies."
"We all know that satellites are used for the protection and observation of our environment, for risk prevention and for the defence of our territory and are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives."
"The benefits of a coordinated space policy are therefore important to us and have already enabled progress to be made in cooperation."
"As several Members have already said, we must now step up a gear and put in place a genuine European policy."
"As Mrs Langenhagen said, in an area where it has immense potential, the European Union must acquire the resources that make success possible."
"However, the fact that no decisions have been taken on the future of the Galileo European satellite navigation project is a regrettable example of what we must avoid."
"Considerable investment has already been made and we cannot allow ourselves to take this amount of time before reaching an agreement, because we lose a little more credibility each time this happens."
"But, I know, as all of us in this House know, that you, Commissioner, are making every effort to bring this project to fruition."
"In March, the Transport Council is due to take a decision on the future of Galileo and Parliament must bring to bear its full weight so that this decision can be reached."
"At the Laeken European Council, the representatives of the Member States pledged to make the common security and defence policy more operational."
"As the report points out, if space activities are to be intended only for peaceful purposes, this can include military uses for peace-keeping activities, as requested in the amendment tabled by Mr Chichester and Mr Radwan on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"How can it be feasible for the European Union to develop a common defence policy if it does not make available the technical resources for this domain?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must draw up a realistic and consistent framework for our space policy."
"The protection of the environment, the security of our people and the preservation of peace all depend on this."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on staying in office."
"It is you that we have to thank for your constant reference to religious values in the Convention on Fundamental Rights and for your reclaiming of them."
"The phrase 'European values' is often an empty one."
"It could, though, be a quite different matter with this report in our hands, because this report means that there is a chance of Europe demonstrating, in a very important area, that we do things differently to the others."
"We can make outer space a space for peace."
"Then again, that has a great deal to do with principles."
"Here we have Amendment No 1, which says: '...which can also include a military application for peace-keeping operations.'"
"Space for peacekeeping operations - one might polemically say, yes, but against whom?"
"Against the little men from Mars, who are on their way here, or for the use - as Mr Chichester has hinted - of a military-industrial complex yet to be created in Europe?"
"That would be devastating."
"It would be precisely the dependence on the military-industrial complex that so much characterises the last remaining superpower that we would be inviting in through the back door while still talking of European values."
"That would be Pharisaical!"
"I would very much recommend rejection of Amendment No 1, but the adoption of those following it."
"Particularly when Christian and religious values are at issue, values of which you, Mr President, have always rightly reminded us."
"Mr President, the USA unilaterally withdrew from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty."
"This happened after their own national intelligence service stated that no missile threat from any 'rogue state' even exists, at least not for the next ten years."
"According to the American press, the Republicans in Congress pressured the intelligence organs to change their stance and to create a baseless threat scenario."
"A powerful missile shield is now being created in response to this figment of the imagination."
"Ultimately, nobody is safe from injustice and from the terrorism which draws strength from this."
"September's treacherous terror assaults show us where the true threats to security lie."
"A missile shield will militarise space, since antiballistic missiles operate in space."
"The result of this will be a renewed arms race, but in response to the USA's example we too are making a small decision on principle here: in our opinion Galileo may be used for military purposes in peacekeeping operations."
"The people of this world need common security and justice which applies to everyone."
"This must be the main goal of the Union."
"The hunt for terrorists will never end if we fail to remove the causes of uprisings and civil rights struggles."
"The demilitarisation of space, which was achieved with so much trouble during the Cold War, is ending without any rational reason."
"There will always be those who are ready to carry out absurd acts."
"Is it the case that when the absurd act does not concern individual structures, but the entire world, it becomes more acceptable?"
"When we worry just about our own security, we are sowing the seeds of war."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the request of the Council, the European Commission has produced a communication on the need to undertake the rapid development of a consistent space strategy in conjunction with the European Space Agency."
"Like the rapporteur, Mr Alyssandrakis, I welcome this and I also congratulate him on his excellent work as rapporteur."
"The Commission is proposing to strengthen the foundations of its space activities by developing scientific knowledge."
"The rapporteur stresses the need to develop further the technological basis."
"In my view, all this involves substantial public support, financial support, although support, other than financial, may be required."
"The Sixth Framework Programme on Research, for which I am the general rapporteur, meets this requirement in part, by making space and aeronautics one of its seven priorities and granting it a budget of just over EUR 1 billion."
"In my report, I also proposed measures to train researchers and engineers, both in the field of space and in other areas, in order to resolve problems relating to their mobility, which are exacerbated by the physical distance between sites."
"My last point is to mention the dangers of the militarisation of space."
"There are risks, undoubtedly, but I do not think that we can undertake military activities when our goal is to prevent or to manage conflicts in order to keep or find peace."
"Nevertheless, our priority must be to develop further the use of space for purposes of general interest and public service."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on your re-election."
"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Alyssandrakis and thank him for his clear and constructive report, and also to thank all the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as the members of the various committees who have taken part in this debate and who have been involved in this report."
"I am very pleased to be able to take part in this debate today and to do so on behalf of the Commission, in place of my colleague Philippe Busquin, with whom we work very closely on the issue of space, especially in view of my responsibilities in this area with the Galileo project."
"The report you are debating today is an important milestone in the history of European space policy, whose development has recently been taken on board by the Community institutions."
"It is the political support for the work carried out by the Commission and the European Space Agency within the framework of their joint working group, work which is fully described in the recommendations of the motion for a resolution."
"My colleague, Philippe Busquin, has been working very hard on this project, which I know will go towards fulfilling Europe' s requirements for becoming the most competitive knowledge-based society in the world by 2010."
"My speech will focus on three points."
"The first is the spirit of the European Space Policy, which is part of the framework of a vision of a Europe that takes full advantage of the potential of the knowledge-based economy, especially through the creation of a true European research area, in line with the spirit of the Lisbon conclusions, which should also be the spirit in Barcelona."
"A Europe, furthermore, that actively encourages sustainable development, which, since Gothenburg, has been one of the European Union' s priorities."
"A Europe that is willing to involve its citizens more in the decision-making process, thereby giving a practical example of governance."
"This is exactly where Parliament' s role is crucial, especially in explaining technical issues, such as Space."
"In addition to these general principles we need to mention two specific aspects: firstly, the will to accept the international dimension of space and our responsibilities on the world stage, providing Europe with the means it needs to be truly independent; and secondly, the concern to work on maintaining peace and to ensure the security of all European citizens."
"At this juncture, I would like to point out - in response to some concerns expressed by the rapporteur - the resolute nature of the instrument for peace that is the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) initiative in the area of environmental monitoring and safety."
"The second aspect is the recent progress made in this field, given that over the last year considerable progress has been made in the area of space policy by means of the communication that you are examining today and also the associated Council resolution."
"European Union policy has taken account of the strategic importance of space activity for Europe."
"With regard to the specific progress made, I would like to mention two fundamental stages."
"The first was the creation of a joint Commission and Space Agency task force, which resulted in a second communication. This was presented at the end of 2001 to the European Council, the Space Agency and Parliament."
"The second stage is the joint preparation of a strategy for the implementation of the GMES initiative."
"Within this framework, an action plan has been prepared, firstly at European Union level, then at European Space Agency level, with the approval of an additional section at the Agency Ministers' Council."
"In 2001, however, certain limitations came to light, for example the lack of results obtained from the last Council of Transport Ministers with regard to the Galileo project."
"I deeply regret that these delays have occurred and I would like to once again state very clearly that, in my opinion, there is no economic justification for calling the viability of the project into question, although what remains, ultimately, are doubts with regard to the political will to go ahead with a project as ambitious as the Galileo project."
"I hope that these doubts can be allayed in the next few weeks and that by March the Union will have made a positive decision, once and for all."
"The third aspect concerns the future."
"What, exactly, is there left for us to do?"
"The answer is, a great deal."
"In order for Europe to fulfil its proper role in this regard, it must establish close cooperation with all parties concerned, especially with regard to a more operational form of cooperation between the Commission and the European Space Agency."
"In the short term, this involves negotiating a framework agreement between these two institutions to formalise cooperation between them and to confer the role of organising the implementation of the Union' s space programmes on the Agency."
"An informal 'Space Council' will have to be convened at some stage, that brings together the Research Council and the Council of the European Space Agency."
"In the medium term, it is proposed that the Councils of the Union and the European Space Agency, as well as the European Parliament should decide on space policy, on the basis of the guidelines provided by the Heads of State and Government."
"However, in the longer term and specifically within the framework of the debate that is due to start shortly on the future of the Union, the European Space Agency, and space policy in particular, must also be reflected in the Treaty itself."
"Before drawing my conclusions I would like to make some comments on a number of recommendations outlined in the Alyssandrakis report."
"I would like to focus specifically on the issue of frequencies."
"A European coordination mechanism is being set up in this field in the form of a task force in which national political leaders will participate in the area of regulation."
"Another issue is that of full convergence between the report by the think tank' s task force and Parliament' s point of view, with regard to the need to carefully study the situation of competition on a world scale and to adopt appropriate measures, especially with regard to launch pads."
"We are also very interested in the idea of organising an international conference to explore opportunities for cooperation."
"As Mr Alyssandrakis is well aware, we are already cooperating very closely with Russia."
"Finally, generally speaking, the Sixth Framework Programme should make progress in the direction proposed in various recommendations, because for the first time, the subject of space is one of the priorities of this framework programme, but also because the European Space Agency will, for the first time, be able to participate in the programme as a partner with full rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the report that you are going to adopt represents a substantial and powerful boost for the efforts to implement an authentic European Space Policy."
"The success of such an undertaking requires the mobilisation of all of those involved and strong support from all of you here today."
"I would like to say - along the same lines as some of the other speakers, such as Mr Savary and Mr Caudron - that we cannot block the necessary capacity and presence of the European Union with regard to space technologies on the pretext that certain types of project could have a dual usage."
"It has been clearly stated that the objective of the GMES initiative is peace, and that the initiative is not financed from budgets, nor from funds with military financing and uses."
"In fact, quite the opposite is true, and this holds for the Galileo project too."
"Simply avoiding taking part in the space race for the sake of peace will not prevent space, which is already partially militarised, from becoming more so."
"We must have a firm will to be in space with the criteria of the European Union in mind: to see space used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind as a whole."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Road Transport"
"The next item is the Joint Debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0437/2001) by Mr Hatzidakis on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive [9068/1/2001 - C5-0433/2001 - 2000/0060(COD)] laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic,"
"(A5-0469/2001) by Mr van Dam on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulations (EEC) No 881/92 and (EEC) No 3118/93 for the purposes of establishing a driver attestation (10353/1/2001 - C5-0473/2001 - 2000/0297(COD), and"
"(A5-0430/2001) by Mr Grosch on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council [COM(2001)56 - C5-0037/2001 - 2001/0033(COD)] on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, when I started working on this report, I thought I would be able to wrap it up in no time at all."
"In the end, it was far more complicated than I had imagined, but today we are on our way to an auspicious ending and that is what counts."
"The aim of this proposal for a directive is to harmonise the maximum length of both rigid and articulated buses when undertaking transport throughout the European Union."
"Until now, this matter has not been regulated explicitly; there was only the guarantee that rigid buses of up to 12 metres and articulated buses of up to 18 metres could circulate freely in the European Union."
"At national level, for example, there are 4 different maximum lengths for rigid buses, meaning that some buses are unsuitable for EU-wide use, thereby distorting competition."
"The Member States wish to harmonise these maximum lengths, at least for buses used throughout the European Union, and have asked the Commission to work out a proposal."
"I should like to remind the House that Parliament adopted 3 amendments at first reading."
"In the first amendment, it proposed extending the date until which Member States may authorise buses with dimensions not complying with the requirements of the new directive to circulate on their territory from December 2009, as proposed by the Commission, to 2015, in order to allow a normal economic life for those buses."
"The Council proposed stretching this date even further until December 2020, a modification the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed with fully."
"With the second amendment, the European Parliament proposes the same length of 18.75 metres for articulated buses, as for buses with trailers. The common position also accepted this amendment so of course we have no problem there."
"The last amendment allows rigid buses of up to 13.5 metres to have two axles."
"Buses between 13.5 and 15 metres long must have three axles, in order to avoid exceeding the maximum weight per axle."
"This amendment too was accepted."
"Only the part of this amendment defining ""rigid"" was not accepted, but this is a merely terminological question."
"It should be noted that the common position adopts the Commission's proposal to use the new manoeuvrability criteria which are in the process of being adopted within the Economic Committee for Europe of the United Nations in Geneva."
"Portugal and the United Kingdom, I would remind you, may ban buses from their territory which do not comply with the old, stricter manoeuvrability criteria for up to three years after the directive enters into force."
"Similarly, Member States are allowed to impose local restrictions on the use of extra long buses for safety or other reasons."
"I am referring here to Article 7 of the common position, which the committee discussed at length."
"This should largely meet the concerns expressed in some amendments rejected at second reading in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Consequently, it is clear from all this that there is nothing left for me to do but to propose, as the Committee has done, that Plenary adopt this common position without amendment, since it strikes a reasonable balance between internal market, regulatory, safety, technical and commercial considerations."
"Mr President, the proposed regulation introducing a driver attestation requires all drivers in the employ of transport companies within the European Union to carry a standardised document."
"As a result, it would be a simple matter for inspectorates across the EU to verify whether the relevant driver is employed correctly, that is to say in accordance with current, national social legislation rules."
"At the moment, such inspection is difficult to implement outside national borders due to varying regulations and documents."
"Parliament has backed this initiative at first reading."
"It was noted, however, that this proposal could not be expected to be a universal remedy."
"After all, there are also bilateral, international and ECMT licences, by means of which drivers from outside the European Union can legally work in a certain way in the European Union."
"For a number of businesses, the dividing line between the legal and illegal deployment of these drivers does not seem clear enough."
"Consequently, this proposal only applies to drivers who are employed by EU businesses and who drive lorries from these businesses."
"However, Parliament was of the opinion at first reading that the proposal should be subject to a phased introduction for non-EU drivers and EU drivers on account of the administrative measures which Member States would be required to take."
"With this, Parliament demonstrated that it had an insight into the situation in the sector, where non-EU drivers form the key problem, at least judging from the number of complaints about these practices."
"This is why Parliament has opted for a two-year delay before the regulation enters into force for EU drivers."
"In addition, Parliament was of the opinion that the data to be included in the attestation should also comprise the driver' s licence number and social security number."
"In its common position, the Council has shown widespread endorsement of Parliament' s views."
"It recognises the issues described and deems the attestation at least to be a constructive element in solving existing distortions of competition in international road transport."
"Of Parliament' s amendments, the Council has only directly adopted the amendment on the inclusion of the driver' s licence number and social security number."
"The amendments on a phased introduction for non-EU and EU drivers have not been directly adopted by the Council."
"The Council does accept a phased introduction but does not yet wish to establish the ultimate date on which, based on data currently available, the proposal becomes effective for drivers from the European Union."
"The proposal should not enter into force for EU drivers until it transpires that this would actually add value, based on an assessment of the regulation in force at the time."
"In addition, the Council has given an interpretation of the inspection percentage (20%) of the number of attestations issued."
"As rapporteur, I have to conclude that the positions of the Council and Parliament are not miles apart."
"Both recognise the nub and urgency of the problem: non-EU drivers."
"This is the group, therefore, that should come under this regulation as soon as possible."
"Both the Council and Parliament agree on this."
"As far as EU drivers are concerned, I should like to note that - on the basis of data available - the situation is far less urgent."
"The evaluation established by the Council seems to be a useful tool for bringing more data to light."
"However, I am of the opinion that it is very desirable to settle on an end date for this evaluation."
"This is why I am very impressed with Commissioner de Palacio' s written pledge to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to commission the relevant evaluation within three years."
"I trust that she will orally confirm this assurance during this sitting."
"All in all, I think that Parliament can be satisfied with the text that is now before us."
"I would therefore like to recommend that, together with the Commissioner' s pledge, it be adopted without any amendments ."
"I should like to finish off with a remark about the report by Mr Grosch."
"I endorse the report, but it is vital that the candidates be adequately tested after each training course and that daily practice be included in continuous training."
"If we prescribe that it is on the basis of national standards that each driver must be trained, this will promote so-called 'student tourism' , which is exactly what we want to avoid."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the liberalisation of road transport has brought us in Europe greater choice and better prices."
"Competition has also correspondingly become more intense, which has necessarily also led to the tendency for safety and work conditions to lose out in many businesses."
"The directive now before us on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road is intended to be, in essence, a protective measure and to improve the situation of these drivers."
"Not only technological developments but also more stringent environmental and safety requirements seem to us to make a sufficient case for, on the one hand, improving their training and, on the other, needing to add to this through continuous training on a regular basis."
"In the many discussions we have had with the industry, we have also, however, established that shortages in the labour force must not result in this directive having a restrictive effect."
"A reason why I also wish to thank all the groups, who played a very constructive part in this dialogue, is that the Committee accordingly attempted to introduce proposals for amendments which were not intended to completely change the Directive, but to make it a bit more flexible."
"For one thing, we created a sort of bridge to the driving licence, being aware that, in many Member States, training leading to the award of a driving licence already imposes certain conditions equivalent to the training requirements we are proposing."
"So it seems important to us that the training should be gone through without being duplicated, once for the driving licence and again in professional training."
"The same philosophy applied to the training objectives."
"Our concern was not to lay down every detail, but only the training objectives in general terms and thus to leave them in the Annex, because this makes possible the flexible use of these training objectives and leaves open the possibility of adapting them in the light of future developments."
"Training at present varies from one country to another, and we have accordingly laid it down that countries can revise the details in consultation with the Commission."
"The objective is that training should be equal."
"This Directive is not intended to alter any training already provided by a country."
"Continuous training appears to us to be an important issue as regards further development, and we hope that, here too, a bridge to the driving licence may be created, because we see continuous training for the driving licence as also constituting a significant element at a later stage."
"We have also opted for flexibility in the form of seven hours' continuous training, in other words, one day, rather than for larger units, in order not to impose a burden on businesses."
"We have not, I think, gone over the top with one day, representing 0.05% of an employee's labour input."
"I personally also insist firmly that there should be flexibility about the training centres."
"If we are to speak in terms of mobility in Europe these days, the training centre is not necessarily to be tied to the business or to where the driver lives."
"If this certificate is to be valid right across Europe, it should also be possible to train anywhere in Europe."
"In this, we are also aware of the fact that this may well be an interesting and important Directive, but that, unfortunately, not all the problems have yet been solved."
"Mr van Dam has just mentioned the bilateral authorisations, which are still valid in Europe, leaving room for misuse in this area."
"We know too that certain businesses continue to avail themselves of the possibility - something I rather regret about Mr van Dam's report - that we will limit this standard driver's certificate to the countries that are not members of the EU."
"For there are excesses in these areas within the Fifteen Member States too."
"I do not want to name the firms involved, but some names in this field are well known to us."
"I would like to conclude by saying that all this could form an integrated whole if, tomorrow, we were to gain a standard driver's certificate, a directive on journey times and rest periods, a card to confirm these and then also this Directive on driving licences and the training needed today."
"This could be readily monitored; hence our appeal for improved monitoring, not only to the Commission, but especially also to the Member States."
"Any Directive, no matter how good it is, can only be of value if it is regularly monitored - monitored, moreover, to an equal degree in each and every Member State."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate our three rapporteurs - Mr Hatzidakis, Mr van Dam and Mr Grosch - for the work they have done."
"The level of knowledge of the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism never ceases to amaze me, in regard to technical details such as the number of axles on buses, turning circles of buses, and so on and so forth. I am grateful to them for their work."
"As far as the PSE Group is concerned, in relation to Mr Hatzidakis' report, we are happy with the common position and the same goes for Mr van Dam's report."
"We will be voting accordingly."
"Regarding Mr Grosch's report, I welcome the directive because it recognises that we now have an opportunity to improve road safety."
"Working conditions for drivers have direct economic but also safety implications."
"By proposing a training regime for professional drivers we will be enhancing the status of those drivers."
"It is also important to recognise that in light of enlargement these provisions will have to be incorporated into legislation by the candidate countries."
"I know many Member States include driver education in their basic education system, but for those that do not, this directive will make it possible for all drivers to receive proper training."
"The issue of subsidiarity was raised in committee and indeed is raised again in plenary through a number of amendments."
"My group believes that the compromise position that we reached in committee, with the help of our rapporteur, Mr Grosch, enables the directive to offer mere guidelines and therefore negates the need for subsidiarity."
"My group will therefore be voting against most amendments that advocate this principle and in support of the rapporteur's position."
"We will also vote in favour of Amendment No 43, which proposes an assessment of the effectiveness of this directive and vote against other amendments that try to be too prescriptive."
"We are, in short, agreeing with the rapporteur."
"I thank all the rapporteurs for their work and congratulate them all on producing three well-balanced reports."
"First of all, I should like to thank the three rapporteurs for the volume of work they have carried out."
"I should particularly like to congratulate Mr Van Dam on the important work he has done."
"The St. Gothard tunnel accident made it clear that common European legislation is very necessary and urgently required so that tough action can be taken against illegally employed drivers who do not carry the necessary paperwork."
"However, whether attestations will be sufficient will become evident from the evaluation."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his report."
"This too stresses the need for prescribing uniform requirements for drivers, because this is a typically transnational profession."
"In the final analysis, what matters is safety and fair competition on the roads and, in this light, it is of the utmost importance for each driver to have had adequate training before they use the public roads, and for them to be able to specialise and receive continuous training, and for the requirements to be equivalent in all Member States and accession countries."
"This will also afford the profession more standing, which is very important, and will also make it more appealing."
"For the Liberals, it is essential for what has been learnt also to be tested properly by an independent body."
"However, a certain degree of flexibility and pragmatism will be required."
"The duration of the training, as proposed by the Commission, is unnecessarily long and would have an inhibiting effect."
"Furthermore, a proper exam will provide far more certainty that the driver has actually learnt what he thinks he has learnt."
"However, the flexibility which Mr Bradbourn and others would like to build in is excessive in our view."
"We are unable to back the majority of the amendments because they would, in fact, render the regulation superfluous and the exam ineffective, and we should thus be overshooting our target."
"Mr President, Commissioner and rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity briefly to point out that, in fact, in a very short space of time, we have slowly but surely put together a package consisting of a number of reports. These reports are not only those before us but are also those on the organisation of working hours, whereby the working hours for employed, but also for self-employed, drivers have been reduced from an average of 60 to 48 hours."
"In this package, we have drawn on our concern for safety, the environment and efficiency to still try to get a number of proposals adopted in order to improve the whole environment of freight transport by road, as well as the role which the driver plays in this. Reference has already been made to accidents which happen on a regular basis, also involving people from third countries who do not carry the paperwork."
"With regard to the report by Mr Van Dam, I should like to note that we really have been in a position to implement this in a relatively short space of time, and that is why I should like to support his attempts to prevent another round of amendments so that we can roll up our sleeves at the earliest opportunity, in the knowledge that there will undoubtedly be a number of flaws which will be picked up during the evaluation which will take place within three years - at least, I assume that this promise will be confirmed shortly."
"I also endorse the comments by Mr Brian Simpson that the way in which subsidiarity is being used by Mr Bradbourn in his amendments is not actually the way in which we should be working at the moment."
"As the Group of the Greens, we shall resolutely vote against this approach."
"I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to rapporteur Hatzidakis and, obviously, Mr Grosch."
"Mr Hatzidakis, this was a technical amendment."
"These are the kinds of reports which we passed on to the then chairman with great pleasure, and I wish you every success in your next job in this transport environment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are now discussing three proposals concerning road transport, which are not in themselves the most exciting topics to the general public. Consequently, few political points can be scored."
"But even small steps are necessary in order to ensure flexible transportation."
"I thank those who have drafted the reports for their splendid work and, for example, Mr Grosch for his positive and constructive attitude to his colleagues' proposals for amendments."
"With regard to Mr Hatzidakis's report, it is particularly satisfying that the Council is now permitting the use of old buses until the end of their economic life."
"Anything else would of course be a senseless waste of resources."
"As far as dimensions are concerned, I would like to mention the situation regarding lorries."
"Finland and Sweden allow lorries which are larger than normal."
"We allow lorries six and a half metres longer than elsewhere in the EU."
"These dimensions should definitely also be adopted for use throughout the entire area of the EU."
"If this procedure were followed, the load carried by lorries would be increased from forty tonnes to sixty tonnes. The advantages here are obvious even to the layman."
"Space would be saved on our congested roads, since two Finnish lorries are the equivalent of three lorries from elsewhere in Europe."
"Continental Europe could from time to time take a lesson from Nordic pragmatism."
"The combination of improved traffic flow and the economy of scale would lead to a cleaner environment."
"This is precisely what is announced in the Transport White Paper; merci, madame Palacio Vallelersundi."
"Therefore I ask the Commission to respond in this matter and to consider a proposal along these lines."
"It should be remembered that road transport is far and away the most important mode of transportation in Europe, which in addition to everything else offers door-to-door service."
"The railways, which, sad to say, work poorly, must of course be improved."
"The fact that icebreakers travel more quickly than goods trains is absurd (not that Finnish icebreakers are particularly slow!)."
"The last thing we should do, however, is to throw a spanner in the works for road transport."
"The dynamism of Europe depends on a flourishing economy, and the lifeblood of this is effective road transportation."
"By standardising provisions we can ensure fair conditions for competition, not only between forms of transportation but also between Member States."
"I believe that these proposals are a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, I too wish to thank our colleagues for their fine drafting of the reports concerning road transport."
"These actions will improve traffic safety, and this is an important matter."
"A reasonably balanced common position on the maximum authorised dimensions for vehicles has been achieved, as the rapporteur Mr Hatzidakis stated."
"Extending the transitional period makes it possible to make sensible use of the current stock of buses until the end of their life-span."
"The time made available for this is now truly sufficient."
"Technical development offers the opportunity to use increasingly longer vehicles, while at the same time also taking safety factors into consideration."
"Standardising the maximum lengths of buses will also reduce distortions of competition."
"The adoption of a standardised driver's certificate will promote fair competition in the sector and will also improve traffic safety."
"Applying the Regulation solely to the drivers of third countries, at least in the first phase, is justified."
"This third report on standardising the professional training of drivers for the carriage of goods or passenger vehicles by road may both promote traffic safety and improve the status of drivers."
"At the same time it will also be possible to raise the prestige of the sector and to increase its attraction to young people."
"This, too, is an important matter."
"It is also worth noting that a better mode of driving will also spare the environment."
"The basic training requirement for drivers must not however prevent existing drivers from returning to the sector."
"Account is taken of this in the report."
"Participation in training must be as flexible as possible."
"The training programme must be drafted in such a way that the length of one course section should be at least seven hours."
"Most important, however, is to ensure that the training makes it possible to truly improve the professional competence of drivers, exactly as Mrs Sanders-ten Holte recently emphasised here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, every day we read newspaper reports of major accidents on Europe's roads, caused by lorries with over-fatigued, over-worked and inexperienced drivers."
"Who among us does not shake his head and wonder how such a thing is possible on our roads at the beginning of the 21st century?"
"The quality standard for road transport in the EU can and must be increased - there is no doubt about that."
"The driving profession, with the ever-increasing demands made upon it, must be built up and made more appealing."
"The safety of road transport must also be improved."
"It remains to be seen whether the option that the Commission is proposing here will indeed improve the situation."
"In my view, the directive before us will achieve no decisive added value."
"Training is inherently to be welcomed and is advantageous to the profession, but the driving test means that every driver, even today, has to demonstrate more than just a comprehensive knowledge of the Highway Code."
"'Swept twice keeps cleaner longer' , they say back where I come from, but there is no clear and compelling logic to the way the Directive now - as I see it, unnecessarily - requires double the course content in many areas."
"Here is a crucial example."
"There is in Germany already a real training scheme for professional drivers, which takes three years, so, in comparison, the time required, referred to in the title of the Directive and, incidentally, reduced further by the Council, can only be described as basic vocational training."
"Nothing more can be achieved within a time limit of 140 hours."
"I mentioned added value, yet, when I consider the details of the regulations under consideration, what I perceive at several points is more of a deterioration."
"An eighteen-year-old is now supposed to be allowed to drive a forty-ton lorry with a hazardous load across the Alpine passes - and that after only a few hours' basic training!"
"That cannot be what the originator had in mind."
"We need the profession of driver to be enhanced; that is what the Directive is meant to do."
"There is, though, a need for improvement as regards safety on the roads."
"Perhaps everything would be much better, if we had, at long last, a new tachograph."
"Mr President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a directive on weights in international traffic, which is, of course, not only about weights, but also about dimensions."
"This is a typical tactic, to have a heading announcing, actually very tersely, what is meant to be at issue, and then, in the directive in question, to proceed to expand on it as a matter of course."
"I have already for some time now been following with a critical mind developments on European buses, because this wealth of detail was actually far from necessary at a European level."
"We - and Parliament is at one on this point - are, at the end of the day, fighting for the principle of mutual recognition."
"We should then, if at all possible, cause the principle of mutual recognition to prevail in fact."
"Let there be harmonisation only where it is really, absolutely necessary."
"I wish at this point to commend the directive as an example of how short and precise an overall provision on European buses should be."
"What I would really like is for this directive to abrogate all other directives on European buses, thus enabling countries and nations to have buses of a design appropriate to their needs, as, of course, a village bus in Sicily's hot climate has to look different from a bus in London's rush hour or a bus that has to cover great distances in northern Finland."
"This is where harmonisation is false, costing a lot of money and calling for unnecessary effort."
"This is where the Commission urgently needs to do some thinking about which areas require voluntary self-regulation and which need standards to be laid down."
"We have excellent standards committees, but only where they are absolutely necessary do we need framework directives."
"Mr President, these proposals for the training of heavy goods vehicle drivers are, like much of the legislation adopted by this House, totally unnecessary."
"All we need is the mutual recognition of national qualifications, possibly underpinned by a loose framework directive, to ensure minimum standards, especially with regard to third-country nationals."
"However, what we have is a typical piece of EU legislation: intrusive, prescriptive, vastly expensive."
"It is a Christmas tree on which we have hung our wish list of expensive baubles."
"Environmental issues are important, but they have no bearing on the ability to drive a truck."
"The proposals for training on a healthy diet have already attracted widespread ridicule in the British press."
"Asking the British trucker to give up his sausage and eggs is like inviting the Pope to a disco - it simply makes us look absurd."
"But we are inviting worse than ridicule."
"In the UK alone these proposals are estimated by the industry to cost over EUR 200m a year in a business already under great stress."
"The time commitment for training required of the individual owner-operator is unsustainable and will drive hundreds out of business."
"In this House we constantly pay lip service to the needs of SMEs, yet again and again we ignore their concerns."
"We talk about the problem of unemployment, then we pass directives that destroy jobs."
"These proposals form part of a concerted attack by the Commission on the road haulage industry."
"I should declare an interest: my stepson is a truck driver and he and his colleagues are aghast at these proposals."
"I have studied them in vain for a realistic business impact assessment."
"We are looking at huge costs, huge damage to the industry - especially to small businesses - and huge damage to European competitiveness."
"A further impediment to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives, and all for what?"
"For benefits which at best are vague and speculative."
"I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report."
"Let us stand back for a moment and consider the huge damage we do as we create a torrent of onerous and unnecessary legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing three reports, or to be more precise, three legislative proposals that aim to improve road safety and guarantee better a smoother operation of the internal market."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Hatzidakis on his excellent work as rapporteur on the report on the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and on his work on achieving an agreement at the end of this process."
"I would like to express my satisfaction, because the report' s conclusion manages to find a reasonable balance between the internal market, regulation and safety, without forgetting technical and commercial considerations."
"In fact, this was the intention of the Commission when it proposed the initiative and, I would, therefore, like to thank Parliament for adopting the common position, which the Commission fully supports without amendment given that, in practical terms, it incorporates all the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading and introduces other slight modifications to the Commission' s initial proposal."
"Now that I have thanked Mr Hatzidakis for his work, I would like to also thank Mr Van Dam for the work he has done and tell him here and now that the Commission intends to draw up an evaluation report over three years, as soon as the Regulation enters into force."
"I hope that, with this, Parliament will be able to vote on the basis of the Council common position and bring the matter to a conclusion, which will allow us to embark upon a more focused battle for employment and to regulate the situation of third country nationals employed as drivers by EU transport companies."
"Lastly, I would like to refer to the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road."
"I would like to thank Mr Grosch, who has drawn up the last report on road transport that we are debating today and say that the report and its explanatory statement show that the European Parliament shares the point of view of the European Commission on the importance of this proposal, even though it is a technical proposal."
"The measures proposed allow for a complete package to be introduced in the area of training and assessment of bus and truck drivers to establish minimum requirements."
"Mrs Langenhagen, this is not an obligation to reduce the amount of professional training given in particular countries, it simply seeks to establish minimum requirements that must be met in all countries."
"There is, therefore, no need to alter the three-year requirement currently in force in Germany."
"In fact, the opposite is true, given that this is in excess of the minimum stated in the Directive."
"What is really needed is for all German drivers, not just the minimum number, as is the case today, to take up and complete this training."
"The objectives are to raise the quality of professional drivers and standards in road transport in general and to guarantee positive results in terms of road safety."
"Generally speaking, we can accept the majority of the amendments, making a few alterations here and there, but some of them, on the other hand, we are bound to reject. For example, Amendments Nos 25 to 41, which aim to make the initiative the sole responsibility of the Member States."
"We should not forget that only 5% of Community bus and goods vehicle drivers currently benefit from professional training."
"Just 5%."
"This proposal is, therefore, essential in order to improve this situation, and only Community legislation to make it mandatory can fulfil this objective."
"These amendments, however, would lead to reduced safety standards and a clear distortion of competition."
"In particular, with regard to Amendment No 37, we will incorporate some of Mr Bradbourn' s concerns into the modified Commission proposal, in order to thus leave a wider margin for the principle of subsidiarity, because we feel that on some of the issues he has raised, he is right."
"Even if the Commission is able to accept the principle of parallel training with the aim of obtaining both a driving licence and a certificate of professional competence, we would prefer to avoid any kind of duplication, and this why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 6, 16, 17 and 18."
"We cannot accept No 5 either, because imposing basic training on drivers who already work in this profession but do not have three years previous experience could cause difficulties in the sector, which is currently suffering from serious problems due to a lack of drivers."
"However, in the spirit of compromise we could accept Amendment No 27."
"With regard to Amendment No 10, which relates to the inclusion of training within working hours, the Commission considers that this is an issue that both sides of industry should agree upon, and, therefore, cannot be accepted."
"The Commission has problems with Amendment No 13, which refers to the place of training."
"We feel that there could be a certain degree of flexibility in continuous short-term training, and that it should be able to take place both in the Member State in which a driver is normallyresident and in the country in which he or she is contracted to work, but not in other areas, given that there are similar accepted requirements with regard to driving licences and the driver card."
"Amendment No 19 introduces an international transport option based mainly on the understanding of languages."
"This is not the aim of this proposal and, therefore, cannot be accepted and we reject it."
"The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 2, 22 and 23 either, because they go beyond the scope of the current Directive."
"Finally, we believe that Amendments Nos 42, 44 and 45, which lay down the duration of training in the body of the text rather than in the Annex, cannot be accepted either."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by thanking the three rapporteurs for their work."
"I would also like to thank Parliament, and there are no surprises here, for two of their proposals, specifically the proposal on maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and maximum authorised weights in international traffic, and the proposal establishing a driver attestation and I hope that these will be approved so that we can move ahead as soon as possible with their implementation."
"I hope that in later stages of proceedings we will be able to reach agreement on the training of professional drivers for the carriage of goods or passengers by road, which we also consider to be a vitally important factor in improving road safety and in preventing market distortions, specifically in the transport market within the European Union."
"I hope this happens because, as I have already said, many of the amendments tabled are going to be accepted and some of those that mention the suitability of leaving a wider margin for subsidiarity will be incorporated into the amended proposal that we will be presenting at an appropriate time."
"Thank you, Commissioner de Palacio."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"ACP/EC Partnership Agreement"
"The next item is the recommendation (A5-0412/2001) by Mr Rod on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the proposal for a Council decision [2117/2000 - COM(2000)324 - C5-0417/2000 - 2000/0124(AVC)] concerning the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though I adopted a rather critical tone in the report' s explanatory statement, we must nonetheless adopt a constructive approach and, despite the fact that time is getting on, I would recommend that the European Parliament issue an opinion in accordance with the ratification of the ACP-EU agreement."
"The signing of the Cotonou Agreement was not initially accepted."
"Although the ACP countries had always shown they were willing to continue their cooperation with the European Union, Europe was becoming involved in other matters."
"European interests on the international stage changed and Africa became a marginal continent."
"There are no ACP countries among the 10 leading beneficiaries of European aid."
"A genuine political assessment of Lomé was never carried out but the same foundations have been used for Cotonou."
"However, we have doubts regarding the ability of the Cotonou Agreement to provide a dynamic for sustainable development if we do not have a more balanced international economic order, in which the developing countries will finally have rights."
"The structural causes which have undermined the success of the Lomé Conventions are still present: the burden of debt which is strangling the budgets of the ACP countries and their potential to invest in sustainable development, the continued deterioration of trade terms to the detriment of the ACP countries, in the absence of an international system for trade regulation of primary products, a structural adjustments policy which imposes budgetary restrictions on ACP countries and, lastly, an inconsistent European policy which, like its development policy, not only subsidises agricultural production and exports its surplus to developing countries, thus destabilising the local markets, but also authorises industrial fishing vessels to fish the territorial waters of the ACP countries, which adversely affects the local people' s means of subsistence and compromises the protection of biodiversity."
"Furthermore, do not underestimate the internal working problems of the ACP group, the democratic shortcomings in certain countries and the misuse of funds by corrupt regimes."
"The Cotonou Agreement is not groundbreaking."
"It perpetuates and accentuates the transition towards liberalisation initiated by Lomé IV and continued by the international institutions: that is, the liberalisation of trade, coupled with the withdrawal of the non-reciprocal trade system, as well as Stabex and Sysmin, in favour of the future trade regime which is likely to take the form of Regional Economic Partnership Agreements (REPS) that are compatible with WTO rules."
"But can the ACP countries contend with global competition?"
"By differentiating them from the least developed countries (LDCs), which benefit from the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, is there not a danger that this will undermine the cohesion of the ACP group?"
"There is economic liberalisation as well, within the framework of the general agreement on the commercialisation of services."
"Privatisation of this economic sector is a very dangerous process in the ACP countries where the basic public services such as education, health and justice are already fragile, even non-existent."
"Equally, the reference to the TRIPS agreements is a danger for the people of the South who are at risk of being denied access to their own natural resources."
"Biodiversity is under threat."
"Furthermore, in the Cotonou Agreement, the environment is relegated to the background and the sole aim is to limit the environmental impact of development policies, which runs counter to a sustainable development strategy."
"However, the Cotonou Agreement contains some interesting aspects that we must put to good use."
"Acknowledging civil society as an actor in the partnership is a major step forward."
"Its representatives must take part in the dialogue on development strategies and policies at an early stage, be involved in the implementation of programmes and directly benefit from the funds."
"We must define civil society and ensure that it is not exploited by any party."
"The civil society in each ACP country must therefore be organised at national as well as at regional level, in order to actively participate in its country' s development."
"This process has been launched with the ACP Civil Society Forum."
"The European Union must support this process, as it did under the Belgian Presidency."
"The role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is thus strengthened in that it must monitor the participation of civil society as well as, and in particular, the implementation of democratic processes."
"But it has no binding instrument to do this."
"Political dialogue is another essential element."
"It must also be reciprocal and effectively implemented."
"The 'Everything but Arms' initiative was undertaken without consulting the ACP countries and penalties are still random."
"Lastly, since the European Commission wishes to make considerable investments in several key sectors, the National Indicative Programmes should give priority to strengthening public services and administrative and institutional capacities."
"In reality, everything depends on how the Cotonou Agreement is applied."
"For example, the new Cotonou Agreement provides for flexible aid planning, in other words, according to how each country performs."
"But who will define the performance criteria?"
"Will we assess the ability of each country to re-gain some balance in macro-economic affairs or the impact of aid on eradicating poverty?"
"It does not seem likely that the new distribution of competences between the Commission services will provide greater consistency in the development policy."
"To what extent will the Directorate-General for Trade be able to encourage a more favourable trade model in the ACP countries, whilst also protecting European trade interests?"
"Lastly, the fact that the Directorate-General for Development is gradually being stripped of its prerogatives in this area does not bode well."
"As far as we, the Members of the European Parliament, are concerned - and this will be my final point, Mr President - after tomorrow' s vote, our task is finished in theory."
"Since the European Development Fund has no budget, we are no longer responsible for monitoring and achieving the objectives of the ACP-EU cooperation."
"This is unacceptable and we must work together to implement this agreement so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health and educational requirements."
"Mr President, it is now one and a half years since we were able to congratulate the Commission on the Cotonou Agreement, and it is really somewhat disgraceful that there are still only three EU countries that have ratified the agreement."
"I realise that there are probably some that are on the way to doing so in the course of the spring, but it is still not too satisfactory."
"At least it is good that our approval is being put in place tomorrow, even if I agree with the rapporteur that it is only the beginning. However, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"A lot has undeniably happened in the world since the agreement was signed in June 2000, but that does not of course make it any the less important."
"I think it can be said that the fact that foreign policy is bound up with development policy has, since then, been heavily underlined, and I am also pleased that I am today speaking on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for this shows the connection between foreign policy and development policy."
"In a speech in December 2001 in Berlin with the title, 'From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe' , Commissioner Nielson made these words his own."
"Which form of policy comes first may be immaterial."
"However, 11 September made this connection and, in particular, the importance of foreign policy, abundantly clear."
"11 September showed what can happen if we do not ensure development in all parts of the world."
"It is now our task to pursue such development."
"The same applies to our continuing work in Kosovo."
"In connection with Zimbabwe too, the link between foreign policy and development policy is clear, as too is the fact that, in spite of everything, the EU has succeeded in obtaining an agreement, which means that we can operate in Zimbabwe in the hope of achieving good results."
"I agree with the Commissioner, whose speech contained the concluding remarks - which I would certainly echo - to the effect that the C in CFP '...stands for common, not convenient and colonial' ."
"I agree that we therefore still have work to do, as we also have here in Parliament."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work he has put into this document and for the information that is in it."
"However, I am disappointed that he is so pessimistic, both looking back to the past and forward to the future."
"Of course I support some of his criticisms: too much paperwork, a lack of decision-making, slow delivery times and a lack of capacity in developing countries."
"This has given rise to frustration, but Commissioner Nielson is tackling these problems with some vigour."
"I am much more optimistic than the rapporteur."
"I believe the Cotonou Accord is the right path."
"Lomé had its faults."
"But it was a unique concept and much good work was done."
"The new Partnership Agreement is based on the right principles, enhancing the old Lomé Convention."
"The theme of poverty alleviation must be right."
"The only question is how best to implement it."
"There is much discussion on project finance versus budget support."
"Should we be using multilateral aid or bilateral aid?"
"I strongly support multilateral aid backed up by bilateral aid where it can complement a project."
"I do not believe that project aid has failed."
"The problem has been the under-capacity of countries to continue projects once they were completed by the European Union."
"I am equally not yet convinced that budget support can be controlled tightly enough in many developing countries and fear that it will open the door to corruption."
"I believe it is the new factors in the Cotonou Accord that will have the most influence: the political dimension, the emphasis on good governance, conflict prevention and resolution, the interaction with civil society, the regional approach to strengthen trade and the Parliamentary element of the Joint Assembly."
"All these are elements that should strengthen the partnership."
"All this has changed my role as co-president in the last year."
"I certainly have played a more political role in the past year, discussing, for instance, conflict resolution and good governance with President Taylor in Liberia, or having discussions on the Zimbabwe situation with the Presidents of Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique, and hearing and seeing the effects on their countries."
"All this depends on an effective Commission, with properly funded and staffed delegations."
"Most of the ones I have seen are extremely badly serviced at the moment for lack of funds and the petty paperwork they have to handle."
"This is Parliament's fault."
"We must urge all countries to ratify the agreement, as Mrs Dybkjær has said, to allow the ninth EDF to come into force."
"This partnership has to work."
"If we really wish to see an end to economic migration and terrorism in the world, we must provide a standard of living in developing countries which persuades people to stay and work there."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if I might anticipate the result, the Group of the Party of European Socialists can support the Cotonou Agreement with conviction, even though nothing is so good that it cannot be improved still further."
"The tightly allocated speaking time unfortunately does not permit a comprehensive appreciation of the Agreement, and I am therefore obliged to limit myself to a few aspects of it."
"The Cotonou Agreement represents the unbroken continuation of European cooperation with the developing states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which began with the Yaoundé Agreement and has since 1975 been expanded by a total of four Lomé Agreements."
"The parties to Lomé I were just 46 ACP countries and nine Member States of the then European Community."
"The Cotonou Agreement now joins together 77 ACP States and 15 countries of the EU."
"Even more important, though, than the geographical expansion is the broader basis with regard to content."
"The collapse of the blocs and the associated political upheavals across the world, including in the ACP States, meant that the political dimension became more significant, as did trade policy."
"The treaty comprises such important matters as the safeguarding of human rights and the application of the principles of democracy and the rule of law, responsible governance and the strengthening of civil society, failure to observe which may be met with sanctions."
"The political dialogue established by the Cotonou Agreement and the obligation, equally embedded in the Agreement, to work for the consolidation of peace and the prevention and settlement of conflict, along with the declared aim of combating poverty, are important instruments of ACP cooperation, although unfortunately not a guarantee of its success."
"To demonstrate this, it is enough to refer to Sudan, the Horn of Africa, the Congo, Zimbabwe, Islamic fundamentalism and HIV/AIDS."
"Parliament's monitoring of ACP cooperation is an example to the world."
"The Cotonou Agreement has given it a new value, enhancing both its parliamentary character and its role as an open forum for discussion and a monitoring institution."
"This, too, is part of the new quality of the Cotonou Agreement, and it, too, makes it easy for us, as a Group, to support this Agreement."
"Will the Cotonou Agreement yield more results than its Lomé predecessors?"
"The new cooperation agreement with the ACP countries has drawn on the experience gathered to date, and bears witness to new insights in the field of trade, good governance, aid and the role of civil organisations."
"There is naturally room for criticism but, in my view, Mr Rod is taking things too far in his comprehensive report."
"In his analysis, Europe is the devil personified while the ACP countries have been elevated to the status of saints."
"The disastrous, violent conflicts are caused by poverty, and poverty is caused by the rich West."
"Unfortunately, things are not as simple as that."
"It is unfair to claim that Cotonou will only lead to unbridled liberalism."
"However, the agreement does stress with good reason the importance of the participation of players other than the local government, such as NGOs and the private sector."
"Not only donors have to draw lessons, but also the developing countries themselves."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that Cotonou reminds the ACP countries of their own responsibilities."
"It is right that aid should be provided according to the achievements of the receiving countries."
"Success in the longer term does not only depend on us but also, and above all, on the partners' own continuous efforts."
"Would Commissioner Nielsen agree with me on this?"
"Administrative capacity is crucial if results are to be achieved."
"At least as important is preventing the abuse of power and human rights violations."
"I therefore consider the planned, broad dialogue to be at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement."
"It is vital that the EU and the ACP partners should not stop at good intentions."
"Europe must drastically reform its own development, trade and agricultural policy and the ACP countries must put all their efforts into democratisation, political stability and conflict prevention so as to allow their countries to develop socially and to make them fully-fledged trading partners."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Rod and congratulate him on his excellent work on this matter and stress that, broadly speaking, I agree with the ideas he puts forward in his explanatory statement and with the conclusions he proposed and which we approved in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I shall, therefore, limit myself to a few brief observations."
"I wish to say, first of all, that, to my mind, the greatest success of this new Convention lies in the very fact that its moment has actually arrived, given the long and difficult obstacles that we have had to overcome."
"These difficulties and obstacles began with the recommendation to end our partnerships with the ACP countries and culminated in the untimely and rather inconvenient problem of migration, already in the final stage of negotiations."
"The final outcome of these negotiations, in addition to the establishment of a new Convention for a period of twenty years, is therefore, to my mind, to be considered one of the more positive aspects."
"There are also other, more substantial reasons for the Convention, however."
"For example, a greater call for the participation of civil society, especially if this is given a broad meaning and if it is not at variance with the cooperation and support deserved by the central administrations of the ACP States, which suffer, as a rule, from considerable structural weakness."
"This also applies to the regionalisation that has been planned, if this is undertaken carefully, if it is not imposed and if it does not represent an undesirable fragmentation of the ACP countries."
"It should be pointed out, however, that there are also aspects of this new Convention that make us rather apprehensive."
"Firstly, the systematic call for the imposition of unilateral conditions and objectives which, apart from having the potential to destroy a partnership that we want to be of equals, could also undermine the choices made by the ACP countries themselves on their own development policies."
"Secondly, the rapid move towards enshrining the liberalising rationale of the WTO which, as we know, has been particularly damaging to the least-developed countries."
"These are aspects which we cannot sweep under the carpet and which, like the clear change of direction towards the East of the European Union - I would remind you that none of the ACP countries is yet on the list of the ten countries that benefit most from European cooperation - may compromise a partnership that we would like to be beneficial, mutually advantageous and capable of ending the cycle of underdevelopment and the enormous poverty that affects those countries."
"Mr President, we are not doing much more than going over old ground."
"It is nearly two years ago that the negotiations about the Cotonou Agreement were completed."
"Despite this, I hope that the Council will take the report by Mr Rod seriously."
"I would compliment the rapporteur on the sharp analysis in his report."
"The fact that a number of inconsistencies have survived in the Cotonou Agreement and the unwillingness to reduce underdevelopment if this means abandoning self-interest put the rapporteur in a sombre mood regarding the outcome of the development project."
"I share his concerns on this."
"I can only partly subscribe to the shift towards integration in the world trade system instead of a change of that system to benefit the poorest."
"Admittedly, aid without trade is not very effective, but trade is no panacea for underdevelopment."
"I should like to finish off with a word on the future regional trade agreements."
"From the WTO' s perspective, there is little choice other than continuing with Lomé in the same vein."
"However, I should like to draw your attention to another perspective, namely that of development."
"I am not so certain that the regional economic partnership agreements will benefit all our partners."
"Specifically, the least developed countries will not find them very useful."
"Furthermore, conflicts of interest may arise between the various countries in their more or less artificially divided regions."
"This is diametrically opposed to the EU' s conflict prevention policy which is high on the agenda."
"Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, ladies and gentlemen, the new agreement on cooperation and development, the Cotonou Agreement, constitutes a significantly improved framework for cooperation with the ACP States."
"It is an agreement that we emphatically support, one in which the significant improvements in terms of content and policy originated in proposals by Parliament."
"We do not, therefore, share either the rapporteur's highly critical assessment or his reasons for it."
"Indeed, we take the view that it is something of a caricature."
"Let me, in response to the rapporteur's analysis, list three points in favour."
"Firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary assembly represents genuine progress, in that, after an appropriate preparatory period, ACP States will be represented only by freely elected parliamentarians, rather than by ambassadors, as is still to some extent the case."
"This principle must not only be incorporated into the new rules of procedure of our Joint Assembly, but also put into practice."
"We will vote against the admittance of any ACP ambassador if, for example, he displaces freely elected African delegates."
"The second is the regional approach to cooperation, also originating in proposals by this Parliament, which puts an end to economic parochialism in Africa."
"Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements."
"We insist that our regional parliamentary cooperation should begin on the ground this very year, for example subsequent to our Southern African meeting in Cape Town in March or our meeting with ECOWAS in the course of the year."
"Thirdly, we support the reinforcement of the clause on democracy and human rights, which we believe must be speedily implemented."
"Let me mention only Nigeria, Togo and Zimbabwe as examples of why this is so."
"We hope that this will bring about genuine parliamentary partnership with our fellow parliamentarians in Africa and elsewhere in the ACP countries."
"Mr President, our friend Mr Rod' s recommendation in favour of Parliament' s ratification of the Cotonou Agreement is accompanied by an exhaustive analysis of the agreement, its significance and new developments, made from a critical point of view that we share for the same reasons as the rapporteur himself: because of the gaps in the Treaty and the shortcomings that have already become apparent during its short provisional life."
"This does not prevent us, however, from supporting it and encouraging its ratification."
"This agreement was drawn up in a world significantly different to that of the first Lomé Convention. Under current global conditions, economic instruments are no longer sufficient in themselves to steer globalisation towards the goals of justice."
"We must also have instruments of political cooperation."
"For this reason, even with all the shortcomings, this agreement should be welcomed so that we can get the best out of it."
"The role of the European Parliament in this agreement cannot be limited to controlling the European Development Fund."
"I think that we can achieve a great deal with this agreement."
"At the moment, we can publicise its positive aspects and attempt to have it ratified by our national parliaments."
"It is scandalous that a year and a half after it was signed, only three of the fifteen Member States appear to have ratified it."
"Another important action that we can encourage is the consolidation and effective operation of the national parliaments in ACP countries."
"Mr Rod highlights the participation of civil society as something new in the agreement and recognises the ever-important role of the State but, within States themselves, efficient parliaments are the best guarantee of preventing poverty, fighting corruption and of making our cooperation more effective, which is the underlying objective of the Cotonou Agreement."
"We support our partners' parliaments and also the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which will be able to carry out the function of democratic control conferred on it by the agreement."
"Mr Rod asks us the million-dollar question: does our cooperation in the context of the Cotonou agreement aid the development of our ACP partners or does it simply seek to impose the liberal model on these countries?"
"And does the liberal model actually guarantee fair development in these countries?"
"I think that, on its own, it does not work."
"For this reason, we should make an effort to ensure that this Cotonou agreement is apart from being merely a framework for trade relations, an instrument for decent and equitable political and economic relations with the ACP States and to ensure that our cooperation with them is one of the pillars of a supportive and democratic world order that we need and which we are committed to, at least, as far as my group is concerned."
"Mr President, I welcome the report by Mr Rod and I agree with him that the renewal of the framework agreement governing cooperation between the EU and ACP States is best considered against the backdrop of the challenges posed by globalisation, economic liberalisation and the European Commission's reform of external assistance."
"Indeed, over 18 months after the signing at Cotonou, we can now begin to assess the agreement by looking at the actual progress made in bringing it to life."
"First, despite its strengths, in one particular aspect at least the previous Lomé agreement fell short, that is in the fight against poverty."
"I very much welcome the promotion of poverty eradication as one of the core aims of the new partnership agreement, but we must ensure that this is also reflected in the Commission's programming through its country strategy papers."
"I regret to say that the strategy papers reviewed so far show the transport sector receiving 35% and macroeconomic support 25% of all programmable resources."
"In the Committee on Development and Cooperation we have on countless occasions stressed the need to plough resources into basic health and basic education if we are serious about poverty reduction."
"It is right to stress this point again tonight."
"The second crucial change from Lomé concerns civil society participation."
"What sort of results can we expect after hearing reports that civil society has not yet been involved in a genuine and meaningful way?"
"I am disappointed to see that out of a possible 15%, only 2% of resources have been allocated to capacity building in the country strategy papers drawn up so far."
"Was this because civil society organisations were not consulted or because civil society has such a low absorption rate?"
"The Cotonou agreement stipulates that civil society participation should come from the bottom up, yet without the capacity this is impossible."
"Finally, in pointing out some of the practical challenges that lie ahead, I would not and do not want to denigrate the huge achievement of the negotiation and signing of the agreement in the first place."
"The EU-ACP partnership remains a model for North-South cooperation in our world and one which we celebrate properly in our vote for ratification in the European Parliament this week."
"Mr President, allow me first to congratulate Members of Parliament on having taken this important step in the process of approval of the Cotonou Agreement."
"You all know how important it is to complete the ratification process in order to be able to implement the agreement fully, including its financial component."
"You also know how important the ACP-EC relationship is in the framework of the Community' s development policy."
"One very important aspect is that the text of the Cotonou Agreement is a negotiated text."
"This is also indirectly reflected in the comments from many in this debate about the fact that having the agreement is quite an achievement."
"The way we obtained it was through real negotiations."
"This is what Mr Howitt pointed out in presenting this as a model for a more global relationship between north and south."
"There are many deficiencies in it and much of the criticism comes from the fact that it is still very ambitious and it is difficult to implement."
"This has to do with the expectations we have as to what our partner countries actually put into the programming process."
"This is not for us alone to decide, which is partly my response to Mr Howitt's comments."
"I shall now make some brief comments on the report as such."
"I find the report' s approach towards the trade dimension of Cotonou interesting, although I cannot agree with all of it."
"Certainly, the report' s evaluation of the economic and trade regime under Cotonou is based on a political view of development and North-South relations."
"For example, we do not agree with the report that the Cotonou Agreement is in favour of ""development only through market laws""."
"In our view, the Cotonou Agreement provides a comprehensive framework, integrating trade as one instrument among others to promote sustainable development."
"The core element of future trade relations will be the Economic Partnership Agreements which aim to create favourable conditions to enhance both the volume and the benefits of trade."
"It is true, negotiations of regional economic partnership agreements will aim at the progressive and flexible liberalisation of trade flows and at the integration of ACP countries into the world economy."
"But this will be in line with their level of development and will take into account the socio-economic impact of trade measures."
"REPAs will be based on regional integration, strengthening and deepening the existing regional integration initiatives."
"This is also why I do not share the view expressed by Mr Belder that these initiatives could be some sort of risk, in relation to conflict prevention."
"We clearly have the expectation that this regional cooperation will be part of conflict prevention and strengthen it."
"This is what experience tells us."
"REPAs will also be linked to comprehensive economic and social measures which can be financed through the EDF."
"This is not sufficiently reflected in the report."
"Some statements in the report could, in our view, be more precise."
"For example, the reference to EU beef exports to Western Africa is highly critical of substituting local beef by subsidised EU beef."
"However, this argument is based on EU exports from 1981 to 1991."
"We are now in 2002 and the Community' s export policy to developing countries has changed in recent years."
"In particular, since the early 1990s we have considerably reduced the export refunds for beef exports to Western Africa, precisely to avoid any substitution of local beef by subsidised EU beef."
"As a consequence, there has been a progressive decrease of EU beef exports to ECOWAS countries from a level of 54 000 tonnes in 1991 to only 1600 tonnes in 2000."
"This is a classical case."
"We have had a number of them in the debate about coherence."
"Most of these cases are historical cases and they have all been solved. But there are other very real, meaningful important problems to discuss within the framework of the debate on coherence, so I would strongly advise everybody in this debate to put the finger on the real problems instead of providing only archaeological material."
"There is also a certain confusion in the report when it comes to trade relations with LDCs."
"It is stated that LDCs would automatically opt for the Everything but Arms regime, whereas non-LDCs had the choice between Economic Partnership Agreements and the normal GSP regime."
"This is not the case."
"On the contrary, it is important to stress that LDCs will be part of the regional economic partnership agreements process."
"REPAs will tackle all barriers to trade, including issues such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures or technical barriers to trade and will build on the existing regional integration initiatives."
"Both are highly relevant for LDCs."
"Finally, let me emphasise that REPAs need to be integrated into the development strategies of the ACP and the EC."
"It will therefore be essential that negotiations on the REPAs and implementation on the one hand, development policies on the other, are mutually supportive and that appropriate EU support measures are included in regular EDF financing."
"REPAs will set a trade policy framework which will need to be fully coherent with development policies."
"It is true that the objectives of the Cotonou trade agenda are ambitious but doing nothing and continuing with our past approach would incur major risks and would probably not reverse the economic marginalisation of ACP countries."
"When we look at what has happened so far on the basis of the instruments of the past, this is quite obvious."
"The Cotonou Agreement provides the instruments to help ACP countries to integrate in the world economy and to reduce poverty."
"We have to use them in the best possible way."
"It would be a misunderstanding to think that our agreement here and our instruments can do the trick."
"There are very good basic reasons why these poor countries are not well integrated into the world economy."
"There are real problems there."
"The report is written as if it were a realistic assumption that as part of the engineering and the negotiations underlying the Cotonou Agreement we could easily have confronted and changed many of the underlying global issues."
"I hope I am not shocking anyone by saying that it is not as easy as that."
"It never was an option to offer the ACP countries a framework of economic development that was not based on the fact that the market economy is here to stay."
"But this is not the same as saying that the market is the only method."
"The Commission disagrees with that statement."
"In fact the whole endeavour of our ACP-EU cooperation, as well as the rest of our global development cooperation effort, is proof of the fact that we are trying to do something that could never have been done if development was left to the market as such."
"This is why we do it."
"Let me end on a more conciliatory note by quoting from the conclusion of the report, which I strongly support."
"""In effect the existence of a new ACP-EU cooperation agreement is a victory in itself."
"Furthermore, it contains innovative aspects that will have to be interpreted and used constructively."
"As the European Parliament has no powers to amend this text, it is essential to work to get the most out of it, so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health, educational requirements, etc."""
"This is the kind of language I can identify with."
"We welcome this conclusion."
"I want to conclude by expressing deep satisfaction on behalf of the Commission that the European Parliament has now concluded its part of this process and we hope to see it concluded in general as soon as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the continuing deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe."
"Last Friday Zimbabwean ministers had a meeting with EU representatives and they have been asked to write a letter or a report by tomorrow on improvements in the situation in Zimbabwe."
"In fact, over the last week things have continued to deteriorate."
"It is very important that the international community should show that it really means business by bringing Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe to task."
"We need to be preparing smart sanctions now."
"I urge you to ensure that the Council and the Commission take a uniformly tough line on Zimbabwe before it is too late."
"Presidential elections will be held there on 9 March and time is running out."
"Thank you very much, Mr Van Orden, we take note of your words and we shall communicate them to the Presidency."
"Mr MacCormick has the floor for another point of order."
"Mr President, I should like to take up a point Mrs McKenna raised yesterday concerning electronic voting and the secret ballot."
"It is unhappily the case that the secret ballot arrangement by electronic voting is imperfect at the moment."
"It is imperfect because, even when one uses the device mentioned by Mrs Jackson yesterday of a paper to cover the screen, it is easy for one's colleagues behind and beside to see how one voted."
"When a secret ballot is important, Members should be protected from peer-group pressure."
"I would therefore like you to refer to the Bureau the question of whether the electronic voting system can be improved in order to really function as a secret ballot and protect Members from those pressures from which they ought to be protected."
"Thank you Mr MacCormick, it is not necessary to communicate this request to the Bureau, since it already began to study this issue yesterday."
"There are other possibilities."
"It is not that your consideration is irrelevant and we perfectly understand your political interest, but on the basis of our experience yesterday, which was the first under this system, the services are examining how to resolve this issue."
"I, as the person responsible - for the moment, since the allocation of posts in the Bureau has still not been decided and I still have my former responsibilities in relation to buildings -, received a proposal yesterday afternoon which related to this."
"I therefore imagine that the Bureau will be able to resolve this issue soon, with the help of the Quaestors."
"Mr Sumberg has the floor for a point of order."
"I would ask you not to spend too long on points of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"May I ask you to ask the President of this Parliament to note that a vote took place here yesterday for a full inquiry into foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom."
"The vote for that was carried because the British Labour Government refused my constituents an inquiry into that terrible disease."
"In this Parliament yesterday the British Socialists ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Sumberg, please, this is not a point of order."
"I know that you have the right to try to take advantage the opportunities granted you in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, but it was not a point of order."
"Thank you."
"Future of the common fisheries policy"
"The next item is the report (A5-0470/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission White Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy [COM(2001) 135 - C5-0261/2001 - 2001/2115(COS)]"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to inform you that Mr Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for the issues dealt with in the three reports on this morning' s agenda, is ill."
"He was in Strasbourg yesterday, and he is still in Strasbourg at the moment, but he will not be able to take part in these debates."
"I must therefore ask you to forgive the Commission' s absence."
"I believe that we cannot paralyse debates, but that we should go ahead."
"The Commission will be represented here by the top officials responsible but not by the Commissioner, who will not be able to participate."
"On the other hand, the Council, which is not present either, has not apologised for its absence."
"I believe that we must move ahead with our agenda."
"On behalf of the House, I would like to wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, has the floor."
"Mr President, I would like to point out, in support of what you have said, firstly, that Mr Fischler had informed me that he was unwell and was therefore not able to be here with us today."
"I must say that Mr Fischler has always attended other debates."
"Since he is unwell, a case of force majeure, we must of course simply reiterate the President' s wishes for his speedy recovery."
"I think we must go ahead with this debate since we have already spent a lot of time preparing the reports scheduled for today, essentially the Miguélez report."
"These are very important issues and we have managed to have them debated during this January part-session, which was difficult since there were institutional aspects to be resolved."
"And furthermore, we are holding the debate on a Thursday, which is not usual for fisheries, and the reports will be voted on on a Thursday morning."
"Therefore, as chairman of the committee, I would request that we go ahead with the debate despite the fact that the Commissioner is not present and that we send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery."
"Mr President, before the fisheries debate in which I too will be taking part, I would draw your attention to the fact that this afternoon' s agenda features the Stauner report on the Community action programme Leonardo da Vinci."
"I understand that further research is being carried out, as a result of which it would probably not be wise to vote on it at 5 p.m. today."
"I would ask you to consider, together with rapporteur Stauner, whether this topic is ready for a vote today."
"I have a feeling that it is not."
"Mr Meijer, the question of procedure which you raise is certainly feasible."
"The vote is scheduled for this afternoon, if the debate is closed."
"If we have finished with the report which you have referred to, by Mrs Stauner, in accordance with the agenda, the vote is scheduled for 5.00 p.m."
"I would be grateful if we did not hold up this debate any longer."
"Furthermore, Commissioner Vitorino has informed us that he is on his way to Strasbourg, but it will be difficult for him to get here before the vote."
"But if necessary, Mr Varela, Commissioner Vitorino could express the opinion of the Commission, which it has sent us in writing, before the vote, if you think it is essential."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are going to vote on today is clearly not the Miguélez report."
"For obvious reasons: the Committee on Fisheries, by accepting the majority of the amendments to my report, and myself, by reaching a compromise on certain points with some of the Members presenting amendments, have made significant modifications to the initial text."
"This text is, therefore, a synthesis of the various positions held in this Parliament in relation to the reform of the CFP, and when it comes to evaluating it there will be certain people who consider that the glass is half full and others that the glass is half empty."
"In any event, I believe that the report contains a sufficient number of positive elements in comparison with the current CFP for me, as rapporteur, to request that this House vote in favour of it."
"I must say that in the Committee on Fisheries there has been more agreement on the shortcomings of the current CFP than on identifying concrete proposals for its reform."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it contains sufficient positive elements to lay the foundations for a future CFP."
"The greatest difficulty has been in reconciling the various interests: those of the companies, in order to allow them to be economically viable, those of the preservation of resources and social and economic measures which are able to defend an activity largely based in the least developed regions, outermost regions and Objective 1 regions."
"The European Commission should be able to show sufficient political intelligence to reconcile these three aspects, above all because the failure of any one of them would lead to the failure of the other two."
"We are concerned about the existing contradiction between the highly critical analysis carried out by the Commission of the current CFP, which is shared by the European Parliament, and the subsequent proposals for reform, presented in the Green Paper, which are hardly innovative."
"The Green Paper opts for little change, or 'more of the same' , which pleases nobody."
"The report I am presenting is clear when it comes to defining the fundamental objective of the common fisheries policy: balancing the viability of a strategic European Union economic sector - which contributes to our food supply and is vital for employment and the economic and social cohesion of the outermost regions of the Union - with the maintenance of sustainable marine eco-systems."
"With regard to the conservation and management of resources, the Committee on Fisheries asks for TACs to be set by means of rational and transparent measures, incorporating scientific opinions and data from the sector' s professionals, especially since they will be set on a multiannual and multi-species basis."
"It asks for an end to the incoherences between the current CFP and the single market, demanding that areas of restricted fishing, either closed seasons, boxes or restricted access, be based on scientific criteria for the protection of resources."
"In fact, as the report indicates, the current CFP entails a derogation from the principle of equal access and, in the absence of a Council decision, this derogation will end on 31 December 2002."
"The CFP is obliged to respect the fundamental principles contained in the Treaty, including, ladies and gentlemen, the principle of equal treatment."
"Relative stability requires a new analysis, as the report states, of the communities which are highly dependent on fishing, which considers the evolution in the Community over the last 25 years."
"This analysis is essential to the review of the CFP."
"The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the extension of the exclusive access zone beyond the current range of 6-12 miles."
"With regard to the fleet, the report makes its point clearly by pointing out that the Multiannual Guidance Programmes (MAGPs) have not produced the desired results, largely as a result of the lack of will of certain Member States to implement them correctly."
"The reduction of the fleet is a socio-economic sacrifice which, in order to be understood and accepted by the fisheries sector, must be carried out in a balanced fashion in all Member States and also receive sufficient Community financial support."
"The Community must continue to contribute to the modernisation of the fleet, by means of structural measures, strengthening the aspects relating to safety and living conditions on board, without this involving any increase in fishing effort."
"It is therefore necessary to continue with the structural aid."
"With regard to inspection and control, we recognise that the operation of monitoring and control mechanisms is unsatisfactory."
"We believe that all the efforts aimed at conserving resources are destined for failure if we do not have a harmonised European system with a high degree of conformity within the sector."
"It is necessary to extend the competences of the Community inspectors and establish a single penalty system."
"With regard to international relations, the Community must deal with them decisively, relating them to the European Union' s foreign policy."
"From the point of view of fisheries, the Union' s international relations must be seen from a primarily commercial point of view, with a view to achieving fishing opportunities for our fleet."
"The fisheries agreements constitute and will continue to constitute an essential element of the new CFP."
"To this end, it is necessary to create a uniform strategy in the reaching of international agreements, in such a way that the professionals are subject to the same conditions in terms of fishing opportunities, the payment of charges, licences and the using of surplus quotas."
"The European Union' s commercial relations and policy on markets must combine the respect for the principle of Community preference with a reduction in tariffs together with the establishment of a list of sensitive products, giving the processing industry access to the supply of raw materials."
"As for the social aspects, they were completely absent from the Green Paper."
"We ask the Commission to fully incorporate these economic and social measures, which are necessary in order to ensure the economic and social cohesion of the regions dependent on fishing."
"The fisheries sector is characterised by tough working conditions and a lack of collective agreements, which makes it necessary to increase social dialogue."
"To end, within the time allotted to me by my group, I would like to express my regret at the elements that have been lost during these long months of parliamentary negotiation, in particular two points: a Community fleet which can operate under a single flag and a single body of Community inspectors."
"I regret that the European Parliament, on this occasion, is not the innovative and pioneering institution which all we Members wish it to be."
"In terms of fisheries we are decades behind in relation to the European project, but just as we now have euros in our pockets and our skies are watched over by Eurocontrol, sooner or later the European flag will fly on our fishing vessels."
"Mr President, I have changed my usual seat in the Chamber."
"Today, I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The Committee on Development has made a number of fundamental comments on the fisheries policy in relation to the development policy."
"First of all, the Committee notes that the European Union is one of the world' s most important fishing entities and we must be aware of this."
"Furthermore, the EU' s market is so vast that over half the fish consumed is either caught by the EU' s fleet outside Community waters or else imported, much of it from developing countries."
"One can therefore understand that the common fisheries policy can have quite a considerable impact on developing countries."
"The Committee on Development believes that the European Union must ensure its common fisheries policy is consistent with its policy on development and cooperation."
"This is obviously essential because it cannot simply shift the problems of the European fisheries sector to other areas."
"And, as we know, these problems are numerous; for example, we have excess fleet capacity, overexploited resources, declining employment and a largely degraded marine environment."
"Therefore, to shift these problems to other areas of the world is not acceptable and is not an intelligent, long-term policy."
"We also believe that the fisheries agreements, which are one of the crucial elements of the common fisheries policy, must not only be based on this first principle, but also upon reliable scientific assessments of the status of fish stocks and on the impact of fishing on target species, in particular."
"As the main rapporteur said, scientific assessments are clearly necessary."
"If we do not have them, which is, unfortunately, often the case in developing countries, we should adopt the precautionary principle so as to avoid the over-exploitation of resources."
"The final point that I would like to make is that we must ensure adequate protection for coastal fishing communities in third countries and thus guarantee their food safety."
". (ES) Mr President, since we had no choice, the Committee on the Environment decided, with one abstention and a large majority in favour, that only the balance of the marine ecosystem - as other Members have said - is going to guarantee employment in fishing in the future, and the fleet ought to be brought into line with the existing resources."
"As the rapporteur said, we must overcome the failure of the current CFP."
"All of us who live in coastal regions know that biological rest periods, prohibited areas, dimensions of nets, TACs, etc. do not improve the situation and that the proposal made in the Green Paper does not go any way towards improving it."
"We in the Committee on the Environment believe that we must take action on sources of pollution, of which there are many - industrial pollution, huge pressure from tourism, which we in our country understand very well - action on special ecosystems such as those which we have in our country, like the estuaries, action on oil refineries and other plants which act in opposition to what we want to see."
"We need social, environmental and economic indicators that guarantee that actions are effective, as well as accompanying social measures and incentives aimed at sustainable fishing practices, such as the small-scale fishing which takes place on our nearest coasts."
"We must respect the cautionary principle, which is well defined in the code of conduct of the FAO and in the United Nations agreement."
"We must increase consumer confidence by acting not only on traditional fishing, but also on aquaculture."
"There must also be information and increased awareness, as well as the participation of the citizens and the sectors involved so that the measures to be adopted in those sectors may be successful, as well as the participation of local and regional authorities."
"And control and monitoring - as the rapporteur said - of the measures adopted, because otherwise there will be inequality between the various countries."
"Mr President, in our view, we must not forget that greater fleet capacity does not guarantee employment."
"Employment has fallen by 19% in the productive sector and by 10% over recent years in the processing sector."
"We must therefore act to eliminate this contradiction."
"Mr President, I, too, wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery and am also in favour of us not deferring this morning's debate."
"The subject is simply too important."
"Getting this report, with its 400 amendments, through the committee was a really tough business."
"The large number of amendments was certainly not attributable to the involvement of Mrs Miguélez Ramos, whom I respect as a colleague and who has done exemplary work in producing a balanced report, and I would like to thank her once again for this."
"Some will mock and ask themselves what all this expense is for, but I cannot emphasise enough what significance this report has for the future of fisheries in Europe."
"A common fisheries policy has been in place for just about twenty years, with all their highs and lows."
"Fisheries swam through many a trough."
"Brussels cannot be made to bear all the responsibility for that, however."
"On the contrary, not every Member State and not everyone in the fishing industry is pulling their weight, and it is for that reason that the CFP has not fully met the high demands made of it."
"This year, we are at a crossroads in the truest sense of the word."
"In which direction do we want Europe's common fisheries policy to go in future?"
"I can assure you that Parliament's recommendations will fall on good soil at the Commission, as this cooperation between the institutions in the interests of Europe's fisheries, and for their benefit, must be carried on, and it will be."
"Now that the Commission knows what this report recommends, it can submit its reform proposals, which we await with eager anticipation, and so I hope there will be a large majority."
"One thing, though, must be clear. This will be a voyage over a rough sea for, as I have said, there are massive challenges ahead."
"Let me briefly highlight a few things that I see as vital to Europe's future fisheries policy."
"Firstly, without fish, there will be no more fishing industry."
"This equation may be simple, but it is true."
"We must give even more attention to the maintenance of healthy stocks than we did previously, because only healthy marine eco-systems guarantee sustainable management with a future ahead of it."
"After all, we all - here in Parliament and out there on the coastline - want a viable fisheries sector, and one that is viable not only for today and possibly tomorrow, but for the decades yet to come."
"Secondly, we know too little about how the marine eco-system is interlinked, and so there must be more intensive research."
"Thirdly, it is a fact that there are insufficient fish in European waters, and so we must also fish outside them, and to this end we need agreements with third states."
"These are expensive and are costing more and more; they will probably be too expensive as soon as tomorrow."
"We have to strike out on new pathways here, even if this will require greater involvement of those who directly profit."
"We owe this to our taxpayers."
"Time is passing too fast, not only the time I have to speak, but the time left to reform the CFP."
"Let us, by the end of this year, find a common and sustainable solution in the interests of our European fisheries."
"Mr President, the review of the common fisheries policy gives us a chance to guide the future of fisheries in the European Union over the next ten years and we have to get this right."
"The CFP has not yet achieved what it set out to achieve, and that is a sustainable fisheries sector."
"Instead we have a situation where our fish stocks have been depleted and our seas polluted, while our technological capacity to fish has increased beyond recognition."
"The cornerstone of the new CFP has to be environmental and economic sustainability."
"One way of achieving this is to recognise the CFP's regional dimension."
"We should increase industry involvement in fisheries management and conservation, allowing for an improvement of dialogue between fishermen and scientists."
"Sustainability means that we have to take the environmental dimension of fisheries management seriously."
"However, this has to be coupled with clearer procedures for responding quickly to conservation emergencies."
"We should retain the principle of relative stability, but also ensure greater effectiveness and consistency in the control and enforcement of EU requirements, while attempting to simplify the burden of control on fishermen."
"As we know there are still weaknesses in inspection and control, and the inspection structure and coordinated approach must be welcomed."
"However, the use of uniform penalty procedures will require careful examination."
"The area of fisheries agreements which Mr Lannoye talked about also needs to be reviewed."
"Development considerations, poverty reduction and environmental impact are key considerations."
"There have been many examples where local fishermen in some of the world's poorest areas can no longer fish."
"When they cannot fish, they do not eat."
"Reform is essential."
"A lot has to be done in a very short time, but there is too much at stake for it to fail."
"I hope that this time next year, when we return for the first part-session in 2003, we will see a newly reformed CFP fit for the future."
"Mr President, it is obvious to everyone that the fishing industry needs fish."
"Without fish there can be no fishing industry."
"One of the biggest problems with the common fisheries policy over the past 20 years has been that several objectives have not been prioritised."
"This has created conflicts."
"The only way to ensure that the fishing industry has any kind of future is to put conservation at the top of the agenda."
"This is a prerequisite for the industry, not an obstacle that has to be overcome."
"Unless conservation is the number one priority, compromises with other objectives of the common fisheries policy, such as economic ones, will always lead to further erosion of stocks."
"We have tabled an amendment which would set as a prime objective the need to ensure that fish stocks and other marine species remain abundant."
"Both the fishing industry and the Committee on Fisheries claim that they agree with the need to conserve stocks and protect the marine environment."
"The recent cuts in quotas for several stocks in the EU last month provide ample illustration of the need to make conservation of stocks the main priority."
"Mr President, I think this is the first time in seven and a half years in this House that I have had to say publicly that my speech is very personal and does not echo the views of my group."
"There are other very legitimate opinions in the Group of the United European Left."
"But I warn you that it has been difficult to reach a position."
"In any event, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Miguélez for her work."
"Initially, she presented a draft report which seemed to me to be perfectly balanced and which I believe should have served as a basis, with the contribution of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries and with the spirit of Mrs Miguélez, for supplementing what she presented to us."
"But 400 amendments were presented, the majority of which I believe were motivated by exclusively national positions, which do not contribute to the consolidation of a common policy, one of the few common policies, but quite the opposite."
"Mrs Miguélez, after these 400 amendments, made a superhuman effort to present some new compromises."
"I withdrew."
"In this respect, I believe that she did good and even admirable work, but I believe that the final result, the 400 amendments, on which I do not believe we were very generous with her compromises in many respects, is not very coherent."
"There are strong contrasts, in some respects we go into many details and in others we hardly deal with the general issues."
"But, in any event, it is very important to me that I say this, and I will do so very frankly: there are amendments which, in my view, represent fundamental modifications to the Treaty, at a time when the implementation of the euro is strengthening the free movement of people."
"It also expresses the will to make progress with the common fisheries policy and strengthen it."
"Furthermore, one has the sensation that sometimes we are asking for nationalisation of controls of Community waters, while at the same time asking for Community controls in third country waters."
"And sometimes one has the feeling - excuse my frankness - that regionalisation is being used to talk about other things."
"I am going to advise my group not to vote against the final result."
"I do not believe that Mrs Miguélez would deserve that and, in any event, I would repeat once again my spirit of cooperation and I thank you once again for your admirable efforts to achieve a balanced result which, in my view, has not been achieved."
"Mr President, I am disappointed that the Commissioner is not here but I fully appreciate that he is ill and wish him well."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for her work in producing this most important report after very extensive consultation."
"The whole purpose of the Green Paper on the common fisheries policy published in March of last year was to stimulate debate on the future of the common fisheries policy."
"It did indeed stimulate debate, particularly in my own country."
"The Commission called for thorough and urgent reform of the common fisheries policy."
"As a Member of Parliament representing a constituency in which many depend on the fishing industry, I share this view."
"The debate and discussions generated by the Green Paper will be incorporated into the Commission's White Paper for consideration by the Council this year."
"I welcome the consultation process and can assure colleagues that in my Member State the authorities took care to carry out a broad and meaningful consultation."
"The marine minister set up a special review group in order to present a coherent response to all concerned."
"This is as it should be."
"Under the common fisheries policy, and indeed under other EU policies, there has been a tendency to make policy decisions without full consideration of the valuable views of those working and living in the sector concerned."
"Proposals and recommendations in response to the Green Paper on fisheries policy were produced by the Irish national strategy review group on the common fisheries policy, which was set up by the marine minister and included stakeholders."
"It is vitally important that they should be included at all times."
"No common fisheries policy or other policy can be successful unless the stakeholders play an important role in it."
"No doubt the discussions this year in Council will be difficult."
"Important decisions have to be made in key areas, particularly the social and economic dimension of the common fisheries policy."
"It is my view, and one that I know is shared by many Members representing coastal regions, that the Green Paper does not address these aspects adequately."
"It takes little account of the importance of the fisheries sector in coastal regions where there is no alternative source of employment, be they in Ireland or elsewhere in the Community."
"There must be integration; with my country in mind, consideration must be given to fisheries policy, regional development policy, rural development policy and Objective 1 areas."
"I welcome the frankness with which the Commission has spelled out the current state of European fisheries and many proposed changes, if implemented, would help to solve some of the current difficulties."
"A number of additional critical changes must be made to further strengthen the common fisheries policy."
"Greater involvement of fishermen and stakeholders in the management process is long overdue."
"Involving fishermen will do a great deal to improve the credibility of any future policy."
"Genuine regionalisation of management and control will greatly benefit the sector."
"I would urge the Commission to underpin the decentralisation process by creating a Europe-wide network of regional advisory committees."
"Unless practical and feasible changes are made to the control system, fisheries policy will not have the confidence of fishermen and will certainly fail."
"My country has benefited greatly from membership of the European Union over the years."
"However, the fishing industry has paid too high a price in having to share its abundant fishing grounds off the west coast of Ireland with greedy neighbours."
"If there is a depletion of stocks it is not Irish fishermen but some greedy neighbours in other Member States who are responsible for it."
"Mr President, in my country secret cabinet papers are released 30 years after the discussions to which they refer took place."
"As a result, over the last two years, previously secret papers on the negotiations leading up to Britain's entry to the then Common Market have been released and we have been able to see documents relating to the establishment of the common fisheries policy."
"It transpires from these documents that, at its inception, there was no legal basis for the CFP."
"Furthermore, ministers knew this; they were prepared to, and did, lie to the British public about this, despite the certain knowledge that the policy would be a disaster for the fishing industry, but fishermen were regarded as being politically expendable."
"They were sacrificed to ensure that the timetable for British entry was kept on track."
"Since then, the expected disaster has materialised in the form of tens of thousands of fishing and fishing-related jobs lost, financial losses approaching £1 bn for every year of the CFP and a fleet in terminal decline."
"The CFP is also a disaster on a technical level."
"In a 1997 report the Parliamentary Research Service noted that the only examples of successful management systems were to be found in the Falkland Islands, Iceland, Namibia and New Zealand, where fisheries fall within a single jurisdiction."
"There is no example of a common fisheries policy ever working effectively, so the CFP is fatally flawed by virtue of the fact that it is a common policy."
"To this Green Paper and the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, therefore, I and my party can respond that the CFP was built on lies and that technically it is a shambles."
"It represents all that is wrong with the European Union and we believe that it, like the EU, should be abolished with immediate effect - reform is not an option."
"Mr President, I naturally wish Mr Fischler a speedy recovery and I would ask the officials present to give him a detailed account of our concerns."
"The new common fisheries policy is currently being prepared, and I would therefore like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to three crucial points."
"First of all, it is imperative that the new common fisheries policy retain the system of TACs and quotas as its basis, as this is the best way of bringing catches into line with the status of fish stocks."
"These quotas must indeed become multiannual, particularly so that, as the Association du Grand Littoral Atlantique (AGLIA) has requested the Commission, we can avoid erratic fluctuations from one year to the next and enable fishermen to have a minimum of foresight, without which no human or economic activity is possible."
"Furthermore, these quotas must in no way become individual or transferable. Should this happen, we would witness an irreversible concentration and the extinction of sea life in most of our coastal regions."
"We continue to stand by our current system of the collective management of quotas by Member States and the professional fisheries organisations."
"Secondly, the new common fisheries policy must stop using the brutal, unfair, costly and inefficient system of compulsory reductions in fleet capacity."
"The Commission is proposing to strengthen the existing mechanisms for fleet replacement."
"We are totally opposed to this."
"The fact that the Commission yesterday approved an excessive construction of trawler factories in Europe does not mean that it must, practically by making the same mistake again, make it impossible to undertake the essential modernisation of our non-industrial fleet, the need for which is, sadly, all too evident, particularly given the numerous tragic accidents that are caused due to the fact that the fleet working along the Atlantic coast is becoming out-dated."
"The fleet must be managed with flexible and reversible instruments."
"In this connection, aid for modernisation, and most importantly, setting up aid for young people must certainly be maintained in the meantime."
"Thirdly, the new common fisheries policy must establish a sustainable management system, integrating the skills, knowledge and expertise of professionals into the decision-making process."
"A number of recent examples, involving anchovies or hake, for instance, show that it is extremely dangerous to rely exclusively on estimates and on models drawn up by biologists to justify decisions that have particularly serious socio-economic consequences."
"In an area where resource assessment is an extremely complex matter, we must have every available source of information at our disposal."
"I hope that these three concerns, which were greatly emphasised during the consultation process, will inspire the draft regulations that the Commissioner is due to present to us shortly."
"In comparison to the Green Paper, we still have a fair way to go and a great deal of effort must be made."
"We call upon the Commissioner to propose to us a new common fisheries policy, which is essentially forward-looking and no longer a pitiful stopgap measure, because we believe that fishing activities in all our maritime States lies at the heart of the development of coastal regions."
"We believe in the future of the fishing industry."
"We would like to have a common fisheries policy that also believes in the future of the fishing industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by congratulating the rapporteur on the report which she has tabled before the House today on the future of the common fisheries policy."
"It was no easy task and I think that Mrs Miguélez has done a brilliant job."
"And if the outcome is not to everyone's liking, then it is we who are to blame, not the rapporteur."
"The House has examined the problems of the common fisheries policy on numerous occasions in the past."
"This Commission communication is the first stage in the Commission's overall strategy to improve the CFP in the run up to reform."
"So at this stage we need to lay down a few basic principles and priorities for the future CFP."
"First, we must ensure that the basic aim of the CFP is to develop the fisheries sector and guide fishing activities towards viable levels from both the economic and environmental point of view."
"Any other policy would be absurd."
"Secondly, we must ensure we have a more integrated policy at European level, a more harmonised CFP."
"The Commission should submit imaginative proposals which help advance European integration."
"We shall only be able to implement the single market in the fisheries sector if we have uniform joint management of resources for the benefit of a Community fleet."
"Mr President, this Green Paper comes at a time when the EU is confronted with dwindling stocks, over-capacity and ineffective and over-centralised management."
"The review is an opportunity not only rectify shortcomings but also to preserve crucial provisions which are worthwhile and necessary for the survival of Europe's fragile fisheries-dependent communities."
"We must preserve the six- and twelve- mile zones at least."
"We must continue with special conservation areas like the Shetland Box and support historic fishing rights through the fundamental principle of relative stability."
"The common goal of conserving stocks for future generations remains the most important objective of the CFP."
"It is imperative that the promotion of sustainable fisheries and the needs of fisheries-dependent communities are kept to the fore."
"The report paves the way for decentralisation and the Commission must set out a comprehensive form of zonal management, delivered through zonal management committees."
"I stress the word ""management""."
"The fishing industry, the processors, the scientists and NGOs must all be actively involved and their expertise utilised to ensure that the new CFP ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, this debate on the future of the common fisheries policy is the culmination of a major undertaking by the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, and by the Committee on Fisheries, which includes a visit to Portugal and a debate in Lisbon, in which I also had the opportunity to participate, with representatives of the various parties involved in this sector of strategic economic importance to the European Union."
"Of the preparatory work, I would also highlight the welcome given to some of the proposals that I tabled on this sector, which is crucial to food supply and essential for employment and for the economic and social cohesion of the Union' s outermost and coastal regions."
"I would highlight, in particular, the position of rejecting any proposal to introduce a system of individual quotas or individual transferable quotas at EU level, which would amount to the privatisation of fishery resources and to the concentration/verticalisation of catches, which would have negative consequences at the socio-economic and environmental level, and I hope that Parliament will not change this decision."
"I would also highlight the rejection of the Commission' s intention substantially to reduce structural aid in the fishing industry, bearing in mind the socio-economic difficulties facing the industry, and the idea that, in the light of past results, structural aid should be redistributed on a more equitable basis."
"I also wish to refer to the approval of the proposal to set up a specific Community programme to support small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing, and to the need to ensure that the principle of Community preference is respected. I must also highlight the need to improve working conditions and the participation of fishermen in management and the need to maintain the existing system of exclusive access to the 6-12 mile coastal zone, which, nevertheless, I would like to see extended to 24 miles and, in the case of the outermost regions, to at least 50 miles."
"These are proposals which, regrettably, have not been adopted, which was also the fate of compensation for the canning industry and of flexibility with regard to annual revision of the multiannual TACs."
"In any event, Mr President, despite the contradictions and some negative aspects, I feel that the report is generally to be welcomed and I wish to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all her commitment to this work."
"Mr President, I will concentrate on the EU' s agreements with the developing countries."
"The report contains a series of sound declarations of intent but, because in reality they have never been put into effect, the current fisheries agreements are neither an effective contribution to stepping up the fight against poverty nor of economic benefit to the developing countries."
"One of the world' s poorest countries, Mauritania, has just entered into a fisheries agreement with the EU."
"Experts have found that, if the resources are administered sensibly, fishing for cuttlefish alone can give Mauritania an income of USD 100 million per year. However, Mauritania cannot afford to develop its own fisheries and will therefore receive much less compensation from the EU which, with its overfishing, is in the process of eliminating the cuttlefish stock."
"Last year alone, moreover, 300 Mauritanian fishermen lost their lives because fishing conditions had become more dangerous."
"The EU takes from the poor and gives to the rich."
"Those are the deplorable facts."
"Mr President, as other Members have already done, I would like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for the truly exemplary way she has handled this extremely important, weighty, complicated, complex task, endeavouring to incorporate Members' views as far as possible."
"That said, many speakers have reiterated that we are satisfied with the finished product."
"We cannot be entirely satisfied, but then that may have been inevitable."
"There are various issues which are as yet unresolved; these are the issues on which we and the Commission will have to work in the coming years, particularly over the next six months."
"We all know which issues remain unresolved."
"For my part, I would like to identify what might be called three criteria which, if applied, could enable us to find viable solutions to the individual issues."
"Firstly, we must not take the line of imposing penalties."
"This approach too was the result of an excessive desire to educate, to make fishermen understand that if there are no fish they will not be able to continue to make a living."
"But that is in the natural order of things; it is common sense."
"The operators know that conserving fish stocks is the best way to preserve their jobs and they are therefore on our side."
"Secondly, we need more imaginative solutions."
"For example, we have been pursuing the exclusive line of trying to reduce the fishing effort for years now and we know that that line does not yield results, so let us now try to find a different solution."
"Thirdly, we need to be aware that we cannot have a common policy which all support if we do not involve the institutions, the operators and the territories."
"That is why we need regionalisation."
"If we apply these three criteria, I believe it will be possible to find a viable solution to all the issues raised on which we are focusing, and that we will be able to produce a balanced proposal which combines a common policy with respect for the diversities and individual characteristics of each of our countries."
"Mr President, we have set ourselves two objectives, namely to guarantee fishing activities along our coasts whilst also preserving the breeding of fish stocks."
"These two objectives are shared by all."
"We had to make a choice, as the rapporteur has, to either change the entire system, at the risk of destabilising everything or to adapt what we could."
"We chose the second proposal of the two, which was also my preferred option."
"Two principles should then be respected: firstly, that of access to waters - to the 6-12 mile coastal band, I believe - this is already provided, and secondly, the principle of relative stability, which was also taken into consideration."
"These two choices are fundamental and I hope that Parliament will ratify these."
"I will mention three of the changes that we must make."
"I am convinced that it is better to place TACs and quotas at the heart of the common fisheries policy, as they offer the greatest guarantees, particularly if they are multiannual."
"The second change is if multiannual guidance programmes (MAGPs) are retained - and they should be - we must assess the consequences they have for the safety of fishermen."
"Last year, in Brittany alone, which is where I live in France, we lost 25 men at sea."
"I imagine that you have a similar situation where you live."
"This is a considerable number, and it is obviously unacceptable."
"I think that we must step up safety at sea and enable our fishermen to continue to build new boats."
"We must not allow fishing fleets to become out-dated because this increases risks at sea."
"My last point concerns penalties."
"A good regulation is one that is applied to all equally."
"Fishermen feel that, even when two identical mistakes are made, the penalties imposed are different."
"I think that the Commission must pay particular care and attention to these three changes."
"Mr President, it is my view that Parliament should reject the Green Paper."
"This position is not reflected, however, in the report now under our consideration, which, despite containing some acceptable and praiseworthy aspects, has not been drawn up with the necessary energy to counteract the positions of the Commission."
"In the Green Paper, the Commission in fact refuses to consider fisheries as a normal economic sector, crucial to the economy of various maritime countries, such as Galicia, which I represent, and as a sector which must carry out its activities within the norms laid down in the Treaties, respecting, above all, the principles of sustainable development."
"The Commission is upholding the privileges enjoyed by certain States by means of the discriminatory principle of relative stability; it does not propose an appropriate policy for fisheries agreements with third countries and even considers ending, in the medium term, structural funds for fleet renewal."
"Mr President, in the past, the sea was regarded as an infinite source of food for man."
"Meanwhile, even those with an economic interest recognise the danger of the oceans being emptied of their fish stocks, not overnight, but gradually, because the young fish are increasingly given less of a chance of reaching adulthood and of procreating."
"The rapporteur shares with many politicians the hope that it will be possible to combine sustained catch levels with a better protection of the natural balance."
"She is right to call for more consistent compliance with agreements, but that is only a short-term solution."
"Despite the fact that demand for fish continues to rise, a reduction in catch levels at sea will become inevitable."
"This is why replacement employment in coastal areas must be sought, as well as the protection of the Third World."
"This is in preference to highlighting the differences between countries with small, traditional ships that sail out all year round and countries with large, state-of-the-art ships which need to remain docked for part of the time."
"The fact that these two groups continue to blame each other for the depletion of stocks will - more than anything - serve as a good excuse for our not taking adequate action, and we shall not therefore solve the problem."
"Mr President, the report on the future of the CFP must make a major contribution to the shape of this policy after 2002."
"I should therefore like to highlight six issues that I consider to be priorities."
"The first is that we safeguard the continuity of fishing for future generations, which will only be achieved by strengthening the policy of protecting resources and we must therefore take serious account of scientists' recommendations, the mesh-size of nets, the protection of juvenile fish and the reduction of discards. The second issue is to ensure that there is a balanced and flexible management of the quotas and of the TACs, thereby enabling quotas to be transferred from Member States that do not use them to those that need them."
"The sound implementation of the multiannual guidance plans, or of the instruments that come to replace them, seems crucial if we are to achieve this objective, and serious penalties must be imposed on those countries that do not comply."
"The third issue concerns the need to strengthen the international fisheries agreements component, and the European Union must negotiate new opportunities for its ship-owners."
"The fourth issue concerns the need to approach the fisheries sector with an awareness of its specific characteristics and this is why the principle of relative stability must be upheld."
"My fifth point is that we must strengthen the social dimension of the CFP, so as to provide fishermen with essential support for their survival."
"Lastly, we must pursue the structural policy of support for the sector with the aim of keeping the Community fleet permanently up-to-date and adapted to new circumstances."
"I should like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for all the commitment she has shown in her work."
"The end result is not ideal, but I hope that it will provide the basis for what is needed."
"I should like to end by conveying my best wishes to the Commissioner, Franz Fischler, and to take the opportunity to share a saying with him: ""a good plate of cod in the Portuguese style and a good glass of red wine will cure the worst bout of flu"" !"
"I would like to emphasise the points that must be considered to enable us genuinely to take the Mediterranean into account in the common fisheries policy."
"We must introduce an integrated policy through genuine cooperation at international level, whilst striving hard not to give in to a lax attitude, which would have a detrimental effect on our work."
"This can be achieved by revising existing legislation, namely Regulation (EC) No 1626/94, and by adapting the regulation on minimum landing sizes, technical measures and fishing gear to each region."
"We must also carry out in-depth research to enable us to develop an accurate idea as to the potential of anchovy, mackerel, blue-finned tunny and other fish; in other words, how much fishing effort can be supported by the various species."
"We can do this by paying greater attention to the members of the Mediterranean-specific industrial tribunals and by stepping up the activities of the Regional Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, which must be given effective jurisdiction and resources so that it can take action, both in terms of deep sea and inshore fishing."
"I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as well as my colleagues, Mrs Langenhagen and Mrs McKenna, for visiting the Mediterranean coast, particularly Sète, Mèze and Port-la-Nouvelle, for supporting these proposals and for coming to find out what the situation is on the ground."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the report and congratulating the rapporteur."
"I think we all recognise the tremendous difficulty involved in coming forward with this report."
"There are probably things in it that not everyone likes."
"However, in the circumstances it is probably the best that could be achieved as we try to reform the CFP."
"We have to ask ourselves what the European Union wants to achieve in reforming of the common fisheries policy."
"The one thing we can say for certain is that the present common fisheries policy is not one of the best-loved policies of the Union, and there is certainly no guarantee that future changes will endear any future policy to the industry, especially given the pressure on fish stocks and the differing views of scientists and fishermen."
"However, the opportunity is there to be seized and we have to ask whether we can get things right this time."
"Can we achieve a proper balance?"
"Are we in a position to respond to the needs of the industry and respond in time?"
"The problems of the industry have built up a great degree of resentment."
"We have heard here today that there are those who would love to scrap the common fisheries policy and hand it back to national and regional governments."
"That will not put any more fish in the sea or solve any more problems."
"Fish are migratory: they do not stay in one place all the time, year after year."
"So while such a move sounds easy - and to some it sounds very good - we have to ask a number of questions."
"Would renationalisation mean any more fish?"
"I do not think so."
"Would it mean more financial support?"
"I would suggest that it might result in even less financial support to the industry, and markets would not improve."
"So we have to find an acceptable position."
"I have to say bluntly to the Commission that if it cannot get the policy right in the next four to five years, then it will be forced to hand it back to national governments."
"We have an opportunity to get it right."
"The Commission has to involve local fishermen, local areas and local people if it really wants to get it right."
"I would certainly support that - but there has to be meaningful consultation."
"Mr President, the common fisheries policy is one of Europe' s sensitive policies."
"It is characterised by the confusion between the general interests of a common policy, which is dedicated to managing a declining resource, whilst rationalising a traditional economic activity, and the objectives for developing extremely remote regions, for which fishing is one of the few sectors of activity that provides medium- and long-term employment."
"The Commission Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy paints a very gloomy picture and I regret that it contains no reference whatsoever to fishing in the territorial waters of extremely remote regions of the European Union."
"The ideas that are proposed, and above all, the solutions advocated, are obviously designed to meet the challenge posed by continental fishing and are poorly adapted to extremely remote regions."
"These regions have fought for respect for their differences, as laid down in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and so that their specific characteristics can, at last, be taken into account in each of the European Union' s policies and, more importantly, in the common fisheries policy."
"The dimension of this sector in extremely remote regions, its characteristics and, above all, its impact on all fishing activities in Europe should, however, make it much easier than anticipated to justify the practical and specific measures for extremely remote regions, particularly in terms of resource and fleet quotas, of support for coastal fishing and aquaculture, as well as public limits on investment, upon which the growth of this activity in these regions depends."
"An adequate level of investment would enable them to develop and to modernise their fleets, to ensure greater coherence in the measures proposed by the European Commission by reconciling, on the one hand, the objectives for providing financial support to the businesses involved in processing and selling fish products and, on the other, the need to ensure that these businesses receive a regular supply of high quality raw materials."
"Lastly, I would like to add that we should be careful when concluding international fishing agreements and ensure that they take into account, where applicable, the proximity with extremely remote regions."
"Fishing licences issued by third countries to Community fishing vessels should be given, first and foremost, to fishing vessels from the extremely remote regions that are nearest and should not be seen as a means of dislodging the European fleet."
"I cannot conclude without congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the remarkable and difficult work that she has done to enable us to reach a consensual and satisfactory document. It is a task that seemed almost insurmountable."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Stocks of cod and hake"
"The next item is the report (A5-0458/2001) by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on rebuilding stocks of cod and hake in community and adjacent waters [COM(2001) 326 - C5-0466/2001 - 2001/2190(COS)]."
"Mr President, my one-minute allocation in the previous debate did not give me enough time to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for the work she did and the manner in which she did that work."
"I would suggest that the subject of this report also illustrates the need for reform of the common fisheries policy."
"In other words, if we had a successful fisheries management system in the European Union, then perhaps we would not need emergency measures to safeguard declining stocks in this fashion."
"But we do."
"These plans seek to restore stocks of cod and hake to sustainable levels."
"But they also have socio-economic implications, not only for those who fish cod and hake, but also for fishermen whose livelihood depends on stocks associated with either of these fisheries."
"This report emphasises, therefore, a number of key concerns: there should be no broad-brush approach; there must be accurate scientific advice, the impact of industrial fisheries must be recognised; there must be adequate funding; and accessible diversification programmes should be available."
"The Commission itself admits that it has not relied solely on scientific advice and that there is a general lack of scientific advice for assessing long-term recovery plans."
"The Commission's own words are telling."
"I remain unconvinced that scientific advice is sound enough to earn the confidence of the fishermen affected by these measures."
"The Commission believes that the major problem of scientific advice is black landings."
"I have no doubt that so-called black fish landings do have a negative impact on statistics."
"But that points to inherent flaws in the current management system."
"Surely discards are a bigger problem, perhaps the major impact?"
"The report therefore stresses the importance of properly funded and precise scientific advice."
"It also calls for the idea of observers to be extended to ensure that scientists observe actively on fishing vessels."
"This should also help to instil confidence in technical measures."
"The Commission states that with regard to the North Sea closures of last spring it was aware that the effort displaced from the area closed to protect cod would create increased pressure on other stocks."
"The Commission does not, however, address the extent to which this impact could have proven disastrous, had it not been for the responsible action of Scottish fishermen, for example, who voluntarily tied up at their own cost."
"I put it to the Commission that the issue of displaced fishing effort was not properly thought through and that potential displacement must be properly assessed in future closures, with the benefits of closure balanced against the detrimental knock-on effects."
"In welcoming the commitment to tie-up schemes by the Commission, I note that it is not only encouraging compensated tie-up, but also removing the current ceilings on financial contributions."
"I am deeply concerned, though, that funding is not applied equitably amongst fishermen affected by such measures."
"If fishermen are willing to take responsible action themselves, when going to sea could risk further stock decimation, there must be some mechanism that allows them to do so without going bankrupt."
"I strongly urge Members to support both the amendments in the vote today."
"The first asks the Commission not to neglect the specific needs of mixed fisheries, whilst the second calls for measures to encourage environmentally-friendly and smaller-scale fisheries."
"Finally, I also call for the deletion of paragraph 7, which not only is an open attack on small-scale fisheries, but also a ringing endorsement of the promotion of large-scale industrial fisheries which, I contend, is unacceptable."
"In conclusion, we have to strike a balance here between the need to advance the recovery of stocks and the need to avoid disproportionate restrictions on the many different fisheries affected and the resultant negative consequences for those whose livelihood depends on the sea."
"To this end I call on the Commission to take on board the recommendations of this report and to ensure that the fishing industry and scientists are fully involved."
"In this respect would it not make sense to bring about the early introduction of zonal management committees and allow them to take forward recovery plans in a proactive rather than a reactive way?"
"I hope that this afternoon Members will support this report and its amendments."
"Mr President, I wish to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on an excellent and timely report."
"In my earlier speech I was unable to take the time to do so."
"I should like to wish the Commissioner well."
"We could perhaps have a cheap go at him this morning for not being here but, if he is not well, we wish him a speedy recovery."
"Unlike Mr Cunha I cannot offer him a remedy for a speedy recovery, but a hot Irish whiskey is not bad for the flu either."
"I should like to say that this report addresses many current concerns in the fisheries sector and certainly rebuilding the stocks of cod and hake is going to be a tremendous challenge."
"We have to face the reality that this is going to be extremely difficult to achieve."
"That is the one thing that we have learned recently."
"But the truth is that it has to be achieved if we want to maintain stocks in our seas."
"We have to do everything the rapporteur has outlined: increase net size, bring in square mesh panels and recognise, above all, that we must face up to the problems created by discards."
"This is something that has not been faced up to."
"We have paid lip service to it but have not been able to resolve the problem."
"Protection of juveniles is equally important and must be one of our priorities."
"We must have improved scientific information: there can be no broad-brush approach, as has been said."
"In my area in the Irish Sea we now face, for the third year running, the closure of the fishing area for six weeks."
"There is greater willingness among fishermen to cooperate with the authorities and the European Union to achieve the recovery of stocks."
"I have to ask the Commission one question: does it really feel in all honesty that it has responded to the fishermen in this area?"
"I have to say that it cannot bring in closures and tie-ups to help recovery without compensation, as this will not work."
"I would say to the Commission that it is not myself, the rapporteur or any Members in this House with an interest in fisheries, but rather the fishermen who are out there working, trying to make a living and trying to survive in very difficult circumstances who need convincing of the need for this."
"The Commission will not obtain their cooperation unless they are given the support they require."
"Mr President, we are debating a new Commission proposal which contains supplementary measures for the recovery of stocks of cod and hake, and which the Socialist Group supports with some reservations, stemming from the scepticism with which the people involved have received it and the lack of agreement amongst the experts."
"In fact, there is no consensus amongst scientists on the effectiveness of these measures, and this means that, while we share the objectives, we nevertheless doubt their effectiveness."
"The opinion of the Scientific Committee, for example, says that a more drawn-out recovery plan which involves less sacrifice for the fleet is a possibility."
"Hake and cod are two highly valued species on the Community market, resources of which have been drastically reduced as a result of over-fishing."
"But not only by over-fishing of these two species, but also of other associated species, which are part of the food chain and which have reduced sources of food for hake and cod, thereby affecting the conservation of those stocks."
"These preservation measures, which are being presented to us today, imply a forced reduction of the fleet' s activity and taking a part of it out of service, and the Community is therefore obliged to maintain an aid policy which is able to alleviate these negative effects."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the House for having this debate during a prime morning session - normally our debates are at midnight!"
"Long may this continue."
"The Commission communication on the rebuilding of cod and hake stocks is a critical issue for those involved in the industry in Scotland."
"I would like to pay particular attention to the issue of cod."
"Scientific advice for many years has been stark."
"It tells us that various stocks are so far outside safe biological limits that major initiatives are now urgently required to stabilise the decline."
"Thus some form of action must be taken as a matter of urgency."
"Firstly, there is the proposal that fishing effort should be reduced by up to 40 to 50%."
"This is ambitious and begs thorough consideration, working alongside all other Member States."
"Elements of fleet reduction are being achieved through decommissioning of vessels."
"In Scotland the Labour-led coalition has committed over GBP 25 million to such a decommissioning scheme."
"In fact, the first boats began decommissioning last week."
"Secondly, additional technical measures have been introduced to improve the selectivity of gear."
"Thirdly, new monitoring measures have been proposed."
"The issue of closed areas and possible real-time closures have also been considered and, in some cases, introduced in order to allow for the regeneration of stocks."
"The need for action on cod recovery is paramount if there is to be a cod fishery at all."
"We need only look at Newfoundland and Canada to see the consequences of overfishing."
"Even today the cod have not returned."
"However, there are other factors at play."
"Global warming and the linked heating of our oceans are also considerations."
"We should never forget the key link between the environmental decisions that we make in this House and the consequences that these have for the sustainability of our seas."
"In conclusion, all stakeholders, the European institutions, Member State governments and the fishing industry must be involved if any of these measures are to be successful."
"An effective stock recovery programme is essential for the future of cod fisheries in Scotland and the UK."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Environmental Protection Requirements and the Common Fisheries Policy"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that defining a strategy to further integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy is an urgent priority. We therefore welcome this Commission communication."
"However, in my opinion, we should see the communication as the starting point for an open dialogue with operators, research scientists, political institutions and consumers."
"The integration of environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy must happen in such a way that it has the sector' s support, without the costs being borne solely and exclusively by the fisheries sector, particularly since this means small fishing businesses, and in view, especially, of the fact that the sector is the victim of forms of pollution of the marine ecosystem caused by external factors such as marine transport and coastal industries."
"Furthermore, I feel that the integration of environmental requirements must have a scientific basis, and we hope to receive specific data which is the product of current research from the Commission soon."
"In the meantime, we must certainly apply the precautionary principle, but, in this case as well, we need to adopt measures which do not jeopardise the income of small fishing businesses and are different from those proposed by the Commission."
"Indeed, where the Commission speaks of the interaction between the fisheries sector and the environment, it does little more than list the harmful effects of fisheries on the environment, overlooking positive environmental measures which could benefit the fisheries sector such as improvement of coastal areas, creation of restocking and nursery zones, protected marine areas, increasing tourist fishing and investment in research."
"Again, in the face of the very real problem of overfishing, in my humble opinion, the Executive is not drawing up alternative proposals to the drastic solution of terminating the fishing activity altogether, the result of which would be to drive the fishermen away from the sector without establishing adequate accompanying or support measures for them."
"Therefore, in the proposal contained in the report adopted by the Parliamentary Committee on Fisheries, we call upon the Executive to improve coordination of research into fisheries and research into marine biology, not to cut structural aid and to pay greater attention to the specific character of the Mediterranean, whose diversified, multi-species fishery warrants appropriate legislation."
"For example, we are not asking for exceptions to be made for the Mediterranean to current bans such as those on the swordfish nets known as spadare; however, we are calling for agreements with third countries banning or limiting this method of fishing, for otherwise, we will merely be penalising our fishermen without resolving the problem of overfishing."
"Lastly, I must call for greater attention to be paid to eco-labelling, as a response, not least, to the dioxins in fisheries products alarm which has knocked consumer confidence."
", draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. (ES) Mr President, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy could have spoken jointly on this report and on the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, since they are closely related."
"The present report discusses the integration of the environment into the common fisheries policy, and a part of the Green Paper also refers to the preservation of the environment in the marine sector."
"In reality, the strategy of integrating the environmental policy into the rest of the Union' s policies is a strategy which has been mentioned in recent European Councils repeatedly - especially in the Gothenburg European Council - but which is applied little in practice, especially in relation to the industrial policy, the fisheries policy and other Union policies."
"In relation to the fisheries sector - as the rapporteur says - it is unacceptable, for example, that a third of catches are destined for destruction for the production of meal and oils, especially if we also bear in mind that those meals and oils are not controlled and may later end up in the food chain, which could lead once again to a lack of food safety which is of so much concern in the European Union."
"We must respect reproduction periods and use nets that do not desolate the marine environment."
"We are witnessing on our coasts the continuous use of nets which desolate and wipe out all life on the seabed."
"Biological diversity must be preserved, as laid down in the sixth environmental action programme - which we discussed this week and which we are going to vote on at noon - preventing pollution of coastal areas."
"Mr President, I live in a country in which we are surrounded by coastal areas that are extremely beautiful and rich, but which are constantly affected by the actions of industry and excessive pressure from tourism."
"This also endangers fishing."
"I believe that we must not only act on the capacity of the fleet so that the resources we have can be replenished, but that we have to act, above all, on the sources of pollution which impede our marine wealth."
"Mr President, Mr Cunha said earlier that the best cure for Commissioner Fischler's flu would be to eat Portuguese cod."
"I thoroughly agree with that, so long as it is washed down with copious quantities of Scotch whisky."
"I welcome the terms of Mr Lavarra's report, but I would like to ask for support from this House for the two amendments by my Danish colleague, Mr Busk. Mr Busk is quite rightly concerned that the rapporteur has taken a rather negative attitude to industrial fishing, which, as we know, is a mainstay of the Danish fishing industry."
"The Committee on Fisheries recently visited Denmark and met key people involved in industrial fisheries."
"Again, yesterday, there was a seminar here in Strasbourg organised by the Intergroup on Sustainable Development, which heard all sides of the debate for and against industrial fishing."
"It is quite clear that there are many and widespread misconceptions regarding this sector and it is important that this House corrects these misconceptions."
"Firstly, it is worth pointing out that the sandeel fishery is a clean fishery: by-catch is relatively unusual and where, on occasion, there have been well-publicised cases of juvenile haddock or other by-catch being landed by Danish industrial trawlers, these cases have been brought to our attention because Denmark has an effective inspection and monitoring regime with very strict discipline and very stringent punishments for offenders."
"Secondly, as indicated by Mr Busk in his amendments, the TAC for sandeel has actually been reduced by the Council this year to 850 000 tonnes, against scientific evidence which stated that we could take over a million tonnes. Only 25% of the sandeel biomass is being fished."
"Compare that to the 75% of the cod biomass that we exploit in the North Sea."
"So if anyone is guilty of overfishing, it is certainly not the sandeel fishery in Denmark."
"They have also invested a lot of money in getting dioxins out of oil, fish oils and fishmeal, which is a product of the sandeel fishery."
"We must support the Danish fishing sector in this case, and that is why I ask this House to support Mr Busk's two amendments."
"Mr President, first of all I want to say thank you to Mr Lavarra for an excellent piece of work in connection with the report."
"I am able to support the conclusions overall, and I would particularly call upon us to create new development opportunities in the European fisheries sector by integrating environmental considerations into the common fisheries policy."
"The forthcoming revision of the common fisheries policy will also ensure much more far-reaching implementation of the common decisions in all the Member States."
"We must dare to talk openly about what fish, as 'raw materials' , mean for the fishing industry in those countries which have extensive fisheries, and we must also put the regional importance of fisheries into the balance alongside the risks involved and application of the precautionary principle."
"Moreover, we must also recognise the major contribution that fishermen make to daily life."
"I will concentrate, then, on a few points I disagree about."
"I want to begin by saying thank you to Mr Stevenson who has talked in very clear terms about the experiences of the Committee on Fisheries' delegation in Denmark and about how, in Denmark, it has been possible completely to remove the mystique from sand eel fishing, as well as to rebut the many assertions to the effect that it is industrial fishing that is destroying the food chain."
"We therefore need to state that there is now no scientific basis for saying that industrial fishing has a negative effect on the marine environment."
"Without a sound scientific basis, it is rash to want to cut back on industrial fishing, something which would have major consequences for jobs in the fisheries sector."
"What we must do, therefore, is to strive to obtain a broader and better scientific basis in this area too."
"Nor can I support item 9, which is factually incorrect in as much as it would be particularly unreasonable not to use fishmeal and fish oil, which are products very rich in protein and which are of very great value."
"What is more, the European fishmeal industry has made very great strides towards developing a technique for eliminating dioxin."
"In other words, it would really be much healthier in the short term if we were to think in terms of using fishmeal to feed fish within aquacultures rather than, if I may say so, in terms of their receiving it through the normal food chain out in the oceans where, right now, the dioxin content is unfortunately higher than we would wish."
"In this context, it is important to note that dioxin does not come naturally from the sea and is not found naturally in fish, but is a form of pollution that comes from the land."
"There are unfortunately too many food scandals, and it is therefore also important for us to point out that the fisheries sector is as a rule the victim and that it has not been possible subsequently to prove that it is this sector that is liable for the scandals or occurrences in question."
"I must also say that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is unable to support item 14, since we are opposed to financial aid for the construction of new vessels."
"As I was very pleased to hear Mr Stevenson also do, I must naturally call for us to support the two amendments I have tabled on behalf of the ELDR Group."
"Mr President, as regards the Miguélez Ramos report the Verts/ALE Group considers that the conservation of fish stocks and the protection of the marine environment are of fundamental importance to the common fisheries policy."
"The alternative will inevitably be overfishing and problems for the industry in the long term."
"Given the importance of conservation this report falls very far short of what is really required."
"Among other things, it seeks to relieve the fishing sector of responsibility for depleted fish stocks by saying that it is the fault of pollution, habitat destruction etc. While these factors play a role, there is no doubt whatsoever that the major cause of depleted fish stocks is the excessive amount of fishing carried out by the fishing fleets of the European Union."
"It is time we stopped this state of denial and faced reality."
"We also object to the calls for alternatives to the decommissioning of fishing vessels, which is the single most important step towards allowing stocks to recover."
"We also need to look at the fact that vessels are being transported to other parts of the world, thereby simply passing the problem on."
"Considering the desperate need to incorporate the concept of environmental protection into fisheries, this report falls far short of what is required."
"The Verts/ALE Group cannot support it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.45 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)"
"Vote"

"Madam President, I voted for the Davies report on the amount of ozone in the air."
"I am imagining myself in the year 2030, Madam President."
"The European Parliament has been moved from Strasbourg to Rome."
"Two elderly Members meet: Mr Fatuzzo and Mr Chris Davies."
"I say: 'Do you remember, Mr Davies, when codecision still existed?'"
"'Of course I do,' replies Mr Davies, 'I had drawn up a report on ozone in the air."
"Just think, if we had still had codecision and that rule now, in 2030, thirty years on, we would have had to produce another report on the new requirements on ozone in air."
"I am pleased to say that the European Parliament has changed its rules and now we decide whatever we want on our own, without the Council.'"
"Only a dream, of course, Madam President!"
"Recommendation for second reading by Mrs Myller (A5-0456/2001)"
"Madam President, we have adopted the Sixth Framework Programme on the Environment and I voted for the motion."
"I must tell you about another dream I have had, Madam President."
"There was a city called Europolis, and you yourself were the mayor of that city, Madam President, and you were very happy."
"Why is that?"
"Because this was an ideal city because of its beautiful environment: clean air, no noise, grass and flowers, much better than the fake flowerbeds we have in Parliament, where the flowers are painted on the ground."
"It was the ultimate environmental city and it was all made possible by these programmes."
"That is why I voted for the motion."
"Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis' report is on the dimensions of road vehicles, including motor coaches."
"As you know, pensioners and elderly people, who enjoy a spot of sightseeing and visiting the beautiful cities of Europe when they are in good health, often travel by coach."
"I overheard some pensioners talking to each other when they were on one of these very buses, and one said to the other: 'How are things?'"
"'Fine!'"
"'But how are you getting on with the euro which has just been introduced?'"
"'Extremely well, because I remembered' - they were two Italian pensioners - 'that, immediately before the last war, we had lira and cents, and so I went back in time."
"However, I am also pleased to have very comfortable buses, and this is thanks to the Hatzidakis report."
"I therefore hope Mr Fatuzzo will support it.'"
"Well then, having listened to all this with great pleasure, I did, of course, vote for the motion."
"- (NL) During the initial discussion concerning the authorisation of long, rigid buses on 3 October 2002, I pointed out that these are suitable for sparsely-populated areas where the roads are wide and dead straight."
"In low-traffic urban areas and on narrow, winding country roads, they can pose risks for passing cyclists and pedestrians alike."
"Moreover, without a compulsory second rear axle, they can destroy roads on soft soil, such as in the peaty areas in the Netherlands."
"It is therefore certainly justifiable for a number of EU Member States only to authorise buses up to 12 metres long. If these countries are forced to authorise buses of 15 metres, they will need to install additional prohibition signs throughout the country."
"Although such buses might then have access to the country, they would still be unable to reach many locations in practice."
"Naturally, such buses are cheaper to produce and run, and use up less fuel per passenger."
"In the final analysis, the issue seems mainly to revolve around saving costs at the expense of safety."
"At the time, this was for me a reason to reject the proposals in the main, and this is still the case today."
"The Council proposal to authorise until 2020, instead of 2009, buses which fail to meet the requirements of the directive does not meet with my approval either."
"Recommendation for second reading by Mr Van Dam (A5-0469/2001)"
"Madam President, as you are aware, this report introduces a driver attestation for driving in the European Union."
"The European Parliament regulation stipulates that articulated lorry drivers must have their social security number - their pension number, that is - written on their driving licence."
"Of course, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I welcome this regulation and voted for it, for it will increase the size of pensions: having to write the social security number of drivers on their licences will force employers to pay their pension contributions, and there will therefore be more workers in Europe with higher pensions."
"- (NL) In every industry which is not tied to one location, some employers try to get people from other states to do the work for low wages."
"This could mean that the financial administration is contracted out to India, that supermarkets have clothes made in the Philippines or that lorries are driven in western Europe using Bulgarian or Lithuanian drivers."
"Free competition provides companies that pursue the lowest possible costs and the highest possible profits with major advantages."
"They take away other companies' market shares, even if this is at the expense of employment, the environment or animal welfare."
"As long as the authorities do not act against this, the worst companies retain the best chances of survival."
"In freight transport, this means that freight companies will use Eastern European drivers outside of their own Member State, and thereby avoid paying tax."
"Both the remuneration and the working conditions are unacceptable."
"We have had to wait for too long for the introduction of a driver' s attestation showing the driving licence number and social security number of the person concerned."
"I accept the fact that this will first apply to lorry drivers from outside the EU, but from 2004 their areas of origin might well form part of the EU."
"An effective control system will require the attestation then also to be introduced for lorry drivers who are based in the EU."
"Zappalà report (A5-0378/2001)"
"Madam President, I have had a sleepless night thanks to Mr Zappalà, for I could not decide whether to vote for or against an important amendment which specifies whether the fulfilment of important environmental and social welfare objectives should be taken into account in contract award procedures, that is, whether, when awarding works contracts, public authorities should give precedence to companies which are more advanced and provide greater protection for citizens and workers in the field of the environment and in the field of social security and pensions."
"After a great deal of effort and agonising over what to do, I did, in the end, vote for the motion, although I hope that forthcoming European directives and regulations will regulate all environmental and social welfare legislation in Europe to a much greater and better degree and to the benefit of the citizens and workers."
"We Swedish Social Democrats, Mr Andersson, Mrs Hulthén, Mr Färm and Mr Karlsson, voted against Amendment No 63 because we think it important to have framework agreements for intellectual services too."
"The designation, 'intellectual services' should be specified."
"In Sweden, framework agreements concerning, for example, architectural, medical, auditing, banking and consultancy services are quite usual."
"If this amendment were to be implemented, it would have very awkward consequences in Sweden."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of Amendment No 16, which we consider to be a well balanced amendment."
"It is desirable that public contracts should not be awarded to economic operators who have belonged to criminal organisations or have been guilty of acts involving corruption or fraud. We nonetheless believe it important that the recitals show that it is the Member States that are to determine which conditions are to be fulfilled and what penalty is to have been imposed for the judgement to involve exclusion."
"We also voted in favour of Amendments Nos 48, 79-83, and 86-90, but would nonetheless point out that we really do not think that an enumeration of these different crimes belongs in a directive such as this, because such a list can never be complete."
"I abstained during the final vote on the two reports by Mr Zappalà."
"First of all, I would like to point out that I share Mr Watson' s view regarding the need to reform the European Parliament' s working practices."
"It is quite simply impossible to vote, with full knowledge of the facts, on hundreds of amendments in one hour of voting time."
"In fact, this is only a parody of democracy."
"As far as public procurement is concerned, Parliament' s amendments, even though I appreciate the reasons behind them, make the work of the contracting authorities unnecessarily complicated."
"Public tendering was devised to ensure optimum use of public monies."
"Yet, in trying to meet all kinds of political objectives through an award procedure that seeks to seek out the lowest bidder, Europe will end up with excessive bureaucracy, both for companies and for the public authorities."
"We cannot subscribe to the approach adopted by the rapporteur or to that of the Commission."
"On the pretext of simplifying and updating existing Community legislation on awarding public contracts (the directives of February 1998), both approaches seek to create a single European market using liberal criteria."
"We cannot accept a situation where the lowest price is favoured in the award of public contracts and where social, territorial and environmental criteria are relegated to the background."
"This approach is in thrall to liberal dogma and does not meet the expectations of users, or those of employees, since its principal effect is to harm quality, security and employment."
"The issue of threshold values proposed by the Commission, above which a public contract will be open to Community regulation, seems rather risible."
"To increase these by 50% does not propose an alternative; it simply temporarily defers the moment when private trusts can get their hands on the EUR 1 000 billion generated each year by public procurement in the European Union as a whole (or 14% GNP)."
"We must take a different approach, where the public services are provided by public companies and monitored by the citizens."
"That is why we voted against the Zappalà report."
"- (NL) Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur and the Commissioner on the result achieved with this important report."
"By combining and simplifying various directives in this field, more than 10% of gross European product is covered, and a more transparent and simple directive is to be welcomed with open arms."
"However, I am disappointed with the surfeit of amendments, and it will become necessary in future to use a different system because, due to the multitude of detailed amendments, it will be impossible for fellow MEPs who do not have an intimate knowledge of the content of the report to know what they will be voting on."
"The European procurement policy aims to give the economy a shot in the arm and to involve small and medium-size companies more in the contracts to be awarded by authorities."
"This is a noble-minded enterprise, to which I, as a Liberal, give my unqualified support."
"I am satisfied with the outcome of the vote on the possibility of exclusion on the grounds of social and environmental criteria."
"The functioning of companies within the standards prescribed by the client should under no circumstances form the basis for exclusion."
"Needless to say, everyone should adhere to the law, provided this is generally applicable."
"I am pleased that the social and environmental criteria which can be prescribed now only pertain to products and/or services delivered and thus not to the conduct of the supplying companies."
"Although finally, for reasons of my own, I have voted against increasing the thresholds, I am in agreement with the 50% increase out of practical considerations."
"Needless to say, the amounts which were agreed as thresholds in the WTO Agreement remain applicable, but not for contracts which fall outside the scope of that agreement."
"The contracts which can be awarded beneath the thresholds will naturally also benefit the SMEs - the regional companies, that is - and this is, in a sense, what adopting a social policy within the regions means."
"Having spent two years on the above-mentioned directive, the result is something to be proud of, although, needless to say, it is difficult to please everyone on every score."
"- (NL) Public procurement has for a long time been considered a universal remedy."
"On the one hand, it constitutes an alternative to nepotism, the giving away of contracts by authorities to entrepreneurs who are on friendly terms with politicians or high officials."
"On the other hand, it is intended to bring an end to the manufacture and provision of services by companies that are owned by the authorities themselves, and to grant private companies access to new markets."
"I can accept the first intention, but not the second."
"The latter would make authorities dependent on companies."
"In the Netherlands, it has recently transpired that building firms make agreements with each other about the price which an authority has to pay when building contracts are awarded."
"In that way, companies determine between themselves who is next in line for the subsequent contract."
"This creates a monopoly, in fact."
"Even if this is punishable, it appears in practice extremely difficult to prevent such a course of events."
"What I welcome in the rapporteur' s proposals is the fact that in the case of relatively small contracts, authorities are relieved of the European procurement obligations that are expensive and opaque to them, that employment for disadvantaged groups can be safeguarded, that environmental criteria will play a greater role and that people convicted of financial malpractice will be excluded from procurement."
"I endorse these improvements, but not procurement in general."
"I have voted in favour of the committee' s proposals for increased threshold values to force public contracts, especially for goods and services, to be awarded at European level."
"In their new manifesto, Sweden' s Christian Democrats wish to strengthen the autonomy of local authorities and anchor this in the constitution."
"We believe that more confidence should be placed in local politicians."
"Increased threshold values would give the elected representatives closest to the people more opportunity to decide for themselves whether or not procurement at European level is the most suitable alternative."
"The major political obstacle standing in the way of the adoption of this report is the application threshold values of European standards, which are of absolutely crucial economic importance for public works companies, the environment, public finances and infrastructure quality."
"The crux of the matter, politically speaking, is simple: above what amount, in millions of euro, must a public contract be subjected to Community procedures?"
"There are two conflicting theories, therefore:"
"Those in support of increased threshold values have pointed out that this would avoid administrative costs and cumbersome bureaucratic processes for contracts which will not, in any case, attract international competition."
"They would therefore not enable more cross-border procurement to be carried out in the area of public contracts. At the same time, however, the local authorities must bear the extremely high costs of the tendering process."
"On the other hand, I am in support of maintaining the threshold values at their current level, as proposed by the Commission."
"The aim is to create a genuine single European market in this sector."
"Furthermore, the increases requested would strip the directive of its impact to the point where it no longer has a raison d' être."
"I believe that this increase would risk a radical reduction in the number of contracts which would essentially be open to Community competition."
"The majority of contracts would be granted in accordance with national or regional procedures."
"This is why I abstained from the vote in plenary."
"Zappalà report (A5-0379/2001)"
"Madam President, it is a pity Mr Zappalà has just chosen this precise moment to leave the Chamber, but I am sure someone will tell him that I voted for this document on public works contracts in the water, energy and transport services sectors."
"However, I do hope that the next report on this subject will also stipulate that pensioners and elderly people - who have to use a lot of water and consume a lot of energy and often use public transport - should also receive water and the energy supply in their houses for heating and cooking free of charge, and that they should not have to pay for public transport services either, for pensioners and elderly people have certainly worked hard in their lives and they fully deserve and have the right to expect some thanks from society."
"The second Zappalà report on awarding contracts in the water, energy and transport sectors pursues the same objectives as the first Zappalà report on awarding contracts."
"On the pretext of simplifying and updating existing Community legislation, the rapporteur hopes to create a genuine, liberalised single European market in the water, energy and transport sectors."
"The criterion favoured is that of price over social and territorial cohesion, equality and employment."
"The battle raging over threshold values, like that of taking into greater consideration social and environmental aspects, is, of course, important."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the amendments that aimed to do this."
"But we reject the underlying logic of the rapporteur and the Commission, namely that of liberalising these sectors, as it presents a risk for users and employees."
"On the contrary, whereas some governments are contemplating a review of their policy of liberalising and privatising their public services, the approach of the rapporteur and the Commission seems archaic and dogmatic."
"That is why we voted against the report."
"Grosch report (A5-0430/2001)"
"Madam President, this report approves a directive stipulating that both goods and passenger vehicle drivers must have passed a special test in addition to their driving test."
"As I said just now, where they are still able to do so, a great many pensioners travel by bus or coach out of necessity or to go sightseeing."
"I have to say that it is extremely important that public transport drivers pass these tests, and it is therefore important for this type of test to be introduced so that the pensioners and elderly people who travel by bus can do so in the greatest comfort and always say: 'What a good driver we have had today!'"
"We abstained from voting on this report."
"The only reason we did not vote against is because the introduction of 'uniform driver certification' for professional drivers carrying goods or passengers working in Europe, whether nationals of the European Union or a third country, could help to improve road safety."
"However, the report is still rather vague about the details on how to obtain certification, as well as on who bears the cost of training leave."
"Furthermore, there is no mention of the salary increases that it will bring about."
"And this is not surprising, as the rapporteur acknowledges the fact that he does not stipulate any measure that runs counter to the interests of employers."
"Whilst acknowledging the urgent nature of road safety, this report exonerates employers from their responsibilities in this area."
"Although it states that working conditions for drivers are unacceptable, it endorses their meagre salaries."
"The report blames the 'current economic climate' ."
"As if this 'climate' came out of nowhere!"
"As if, above all, we did not know that the only ones to benefit are road transport employers and the parent companies!"
"But, the rapporteur does not feel the need to question them, nor ascribe to them the insecurity to which they subject all road users by imposing disgraceful working conditions on professional drivers."
"- (DE) My group agrees with this report for the following reasons:"
"1."
"In recent years, drivers have faced ever-increasing demands as part of their job."
"This makes it, in our view, a matter of urgency that all the Member States should put in place obligatory basic vocational training culminating in the award of a certificate of professional competence."
"2."
"We expect that improved quality of training will result in a significant improvement in safety in road traffic."
"3."
"This Directive, in conjunction with the Directives or guidelines on tachographs, the regulations on work time and the social security conditions applicable to drivers, represents another building block for the social protection of professional drivers."
"4."
"The transport sector plays a major role in the context of EU enlargement."
"The more harmonised provisions have already been transposed into the acceding countries' legal systems, the fewer problems of adaptation there will be with regard to technical standardisation, social security standards, provisions on the protection of the environment and road safety regulations in the future."
"5."
"We share the view that the subsidiarity principle means that, although there must be targets as regards what training must incorporate, the actual form and method of training must be left to the national authorities."
"There are of course regulations that we view in a critical light, such as, for example, the low number of total training hours stipulated and their division into teaching blocks."
"In the final analysis, the decisive factor for us is that, in future, the job will require not only a driving licence, but also specialised knowledge of the areas of service provision, health protection, safety and logistics."
"- (NL) For many years, drivers formed part of a profession that could be practised with little training."
"If drivers had enjoyed extensive education, this was not deemed relevant to this job."
"This made their profession appealing to many who found it difficult to stay in education and who were pleased to be able to earn their own income at a young age and in a relatively independent capacity."
"For this reason, many people who have the required driver' s licence for lorries and buses may not be happy if stricter requirements are about to be prescribed for their profession."
"They are exempt from basic training, which prevents them from becoming unemployed and are only obliged to undergo further training every five years."
"The number of hours of training now to be prescribed - a minimum 210 hours and a maximum of 630 hours - is lower than is already required in some Member States."
"These Member States now need to accept that drivers from abroad who are less well trained will now start to work in their countries."
"Consequently, the contribution to road traffic safety, economical use of fuel, good relations with the public, command of languages and better working conditions will therefore be very limited."
"I therefore regard this proposal as a first step which, in time, will need to be followed by others."
"Rod report (A5-0412/2001)"
"Madam President, we have approved the agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States."
"I voted for the motion, particularly because page 11 of the document, lines 11-15, reads: 'The fishing agreements between the European Community and some ACP countries limit local fishermen' s activities in territorial waters and endanger stocks for local people and their means of subsistence.'"
"The rapporteur, Mr Rod, has reiterated what I have always stated in my explanations of vote."
"What are we doing, fishing in the territorial waters of these States when they need to be able to work to make a living?"
"It is therefore appropriate that we should endeavour to change this way of fishing of the States of the European Union."
". (ES) I have voted in favour of the Rod report because I support the signing of the Cotonou Agreement."
"This is for various reasons."
"Firstly, because through this agreement the EU is reaffirming its commitment to the ACP countries, and therefore its will to contribute to the sustainable economic and social development of those countries."
"Secondly, because it makes the eradication of poverty by means of gradual integration into the world economy the main objective of the agreement."
"And thirdly, because the political dimension it includes could make a major contribution to removing the obstacles which have largely prevented ACP-EU cooperation from bearing the fruits we expected."
"In fact, without democracy and peace, it is not possible to promote economic development or to guarantee that the benefits of that development reach the whole population to an equal degree."
"Hence the importance of the political dialogue, good government and the prevention of conflicts that the agreement seeks to achieve."
"I therefore do not agree with many of the criticisms contained in the explanatory statement accompanying the Rod report."
"It is true that everything in this world can be improved, but Cotonou represents a step forward in the EU' s development cooperation policy."
"It is a step which many others must follow, particularly in relation to Parliament' s control of EDF funds."
"This agreement, however, takes us in the right direction."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly was established from the desire to bring the European Union closer to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, with the aim of enhancing the economic, social, institutional and cultural development of the ACP countries."
"On 23 June 2000, a new agreement was signed at Cotonou in Benin."
"It is intended to last 20 years and to reinvigorate the cooperation policy between the European Union and the ACP countries: this is now urgently needed."
"The new agreement, which is due to enter into force this year, goes beyond the strict framework of trade and public aid - which is certainly needed but is not sufficient - it adds a more political dimension by introducing 'good governance' ."
"But be careful, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be mistaken."
"It is misleading to think that we could transpose into developing countries a State model similar to the one that we constructed in developed democracies."
"It is equally misleading to think that the end of poverty decrees that development gains ground, rather than being brought in from outside."
"First and foremost, development is and must be endogenous, because determining export priorities involves making a very dangerous choice - it highlights differences and tensions by encouraging the emergence of a caste of entrepreneurs who are focused on their profit alone, to the detriment of the people."
"It is therefore hoped that this new agreement will take a responsible approach and that the former colonial powers, which include many Member States, finally break free from their guilty practices and will resolutely commit to a new partnership with the ACP countries."
"This would be a partnership that places the emphasis on appreciating the specific assets of each country and not on transposing a European model that cannot be adapted to Africa or some Asian countries."
"Being from the island of Réunion, I am, without doubt, the MEP who lives closest to the African continent. I can assure you that we must pursue our efforts so that this continent, which has for too long been mistreated, finally emerges from under-development."
"Therefore, I willingly voted in favour of these new agreements."
"- (DE) My group supports the recommendation on the ACP/EC Partnership Agreement."
"We welcome the fact that the EU's relations with the ACP States have, in the meantime, achieved a high level."
"New areas of cooperation have been opened up by means of direct commercial exchanges under the Cotonou Agreement."
"This makes it all the more disconcerting that only two of the Fifteen EU States have ratified this Agreement."
"There is no doubt that the Agreement represents an improvement on its predecessors, because it takes the interests of the ACP States into account to a greater degree, yet we are not dealing here with real parity and equal treatment."
"It is dishonest of the EU, on the one hand, to demand of the ACP States efforts to develop a self-supporting economy, whilst at the same time using export subsidies to stifle early attempts at doing so."
"Nor, politically, are the ACP States granted the power of co-decision that is their due."
"The poorest countries, which need the most support and for which thoroughly worked-out approaches to cooperation and development policy are a necessity, have few if any opportunities to take part in the parliamentary assemblies of the EU and of the ACP States."
"I see it as particularly regrettable that the EU still has a split - not to say distorted - relationship with Cuba, a Caribbean state in relation to which it lets itself be guided more by American interests than by its own."
"The Belgian Presidency was keen to break the ice in relations with Cuba and to open up channels for dialogue."
"In doing this, it worked on the basis of three important considerations:"
"1."
"The EU and its Member States must pay closer attention to the situation in Cuba and take note of the facts in an unprejudiced way;"
"2."
"Both sides must acknowledge the political, parliamentary and socio-economic differences and mutually accept them in a particular way;"
"3."
"We must not go down the road of making excessive demands of each other."
"Certain demands are being made of Cuba that are not being met in a number of EU States."
"When Mr Aznar presented the programme for the Spanish Presidency, I regretted the lack of any clear commitment to continue dialogue towards the objective of concluding a partnership agreement between the EU and Cuba, if at all possible before this year is out."
"I am concerned that the modest progress we have achieved may be brought to nought."
"Mr Dalmas, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Cuba, with whom representatives of my group had talks in December last year, clearly expressed his country's hopes for a continued and more intensive dialogue with the EU, and its willingness to engage in it."
"Political experience tells us that it is hard to put a broken thread of conversation together again."
"Cuba should not be excluded from the ACP process, but constructively involved in its further development through dialogue."
"We must welcome the work done by Mr Rod, who puts forward both a constructive and critical approach to the Lomé process."
"It is critical in that the report ruthlessly analyses the shortcomings, the delays and the occasional inconsistencies of a very flawed system."
"However, Mr Rod always bears in mind that the very fact that the Lomé Convention exists and persists is, in itself, a success and a necessity."
"Lomé sanctions the commitment of the European nations to the nations of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and reaffirms how special the bonds between them are."
"To better their common interests, it seeks to use their historic ties that our various countries have fostered over the course of many centuries."
"The Lomé system is an instrument of development, based on trade preferences, which is permanently weakened by the WTO process."
"That is why it is important to reiterate that, whatever commitments have been made by the European Union under the WTO, they do not override the legal commitments undertaken by the European States towards their developing partners."
"The Rod report reiterates this in a very timely manner."
"That is why the MEPs belonging to the Mouvement pour la France will support the rapporteur' s recommendation to issue the opinion that is in line with this new partnership agreement."
"García-Orcoyen Tormo report (A5-0419/2001)"
"Madam President, we are trying to ensure that products on the market are safe for the environment and for the Community' s consumers."
"What a good aim, what fine proposals, what an important Commission report!"
"How could we not support it?"
"However, Madam President, should we not first - and I want to say this openly - look after the health of the workers who make these products and only then, when that is done, concern ourselves with the health of the citizens who consume them?"
"If they are dangerous when they are consumed, just think how dangerous they must be while they are being made in a closed environment on the factory floor!"
"I therefore call for a report to be adopted soon which deals with the health of those who make products as well."
"The development of a market for more ecological products is, of course, an admirable environmental policy objective."
"In this respect, I can only support the European Commission' s approach set out in its Green Paper on integrated product policy."
"However, we cannot imagine an environmental policy that is totally detached from all economic and social considerations."
"In this sense, I welcome the development of the 'European eco-label' that assesses every product against a list of environmental liabilities in accordance with strict criteria, which are yet to be defined."
"In my view, it is wiser to favour incentive measures over penalties."
"But whatever instrument is chosen, I think it is essential to ensure no penalties are imposed on small- and medium-sized companies and craft industries that practice traditional production methods."
"To assist those adapting to these structures, we must consider financial support and tax incentives."
"Practising price correctness by including environmental costs when calculating the real cost of products is also an interesting proposal, on the condition that this measure does not have the effect of excluding the most deprived consumers or, at least, consumers who are the most vulnerable from a social point of view."
"With these reservations, I voted in favour of the report by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo."
"Alyssandrakis report (A5-0451/2001)"
". (EL) It is not often we see a rapporteur vote against his own report."
"In this case, the spirit of the report adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has been altered to such a degree that my political principles left me no other choice."
"It is, I think, highly significant that the majority position adopted in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy was that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes."
"It would have been even more significant had Plenary maintained the essence of that position."
"However, the amendment adopted by Plenary, adding that these purposes may include military applications in the context of peaceful operations, totally negates this initially pacifist stand."
"In doing so, the European Parliament has opened the door to all manner of strategic activities in space, provided they are cloaked in the mantle of a ""peaceful operation"", and the group of the European People's Party, which proposed the amendment, and the group of the Party of European Socialists, which backed it, are primarily to blame."
"We have seen on several occasions and we are seeing more and more frequently just what the strong countries in the European Union understand by peaceful operations."
"We saw it in Yugoslavia and the Balkans, we see it in Afghanistan, we expect to see it in all four corners of the world."
"Aggression, however it is dressed up, lies at the heart of imperialism."
"Now they are clearly thinking about using space to facilitate their criminal policy against the people, to collect information and to spy, so that they can plan their Common Defence and Security Policy operations better and conduct a witch-hunt against terrorism and no doubt elsewhere too."
"Some people are flirting with the idea of collaborating with the USA on an anti-missile shield and some people perhaps think that space is the perfect place to position weapons."
"The fact that the European Parliament has chosen to adopt a pro-military resolution rather than a pacifist resolution comes as no surprise, nor is it the first time."
"We expect nothing less from an institution created by the bourgeoisie for its own protection."
"But nor does the outcome of the vote mean that the matter is closed for the grass-roots movement."
"Resistance to imperialist policies, be they in the form of financial enslavement or in the form of military intervention, is growing all over the world."
"We have no doubt as to what the final outcome of the grass-roots fight will be: it will be a different world, a peaceful, humane society for mankind."
"As has been mentioned several times, this report aims to help the markets and industry 'reap the benefits' of new developments in the European space policy."
"This is why it calls for the 'public funding of infrastructure' in this area and casts no doubt whatsoever on the policy of subsidising private profits with public funding, which is a permanent feature of the European institutions as well as the European States."
"We reject this policy and what it implies, both for the space industry and for other areas, as it only serves the interests of capitalists to the detriment of the interests of the working population."
"We therefore voted against this report."
"- (NL) Fifty years ago, space travel was seen as an important step forward."
"Not only for the readers of books on supposedly human life forms on other planets, but mainly for the competitive battle between the two most powerful countries on the planet."
"Meanwhile, all that remains from this space travel is a museum in Moscow full of space rockets and man-made moons, as well as some film footage of Americans who walked on the moon in 1969."
"Trips to the moon have been a thing of the past for a long time, and further space discoveries can also be made from Earth, thanks to ever improved telescopes."
"The only major space project which Europe has in the pipeline is a satellite system for traffic navigation which is set to compete with an American system that is already operating worldwide."
"I already explained during the vote on the Langenhagen report on 3 October 2001 that I consider this costly project to be a bit of an unnecessary luxury."
"I fully appreciate that my colleague, Mr Alyssandrakis, finds such projects, which fit in with his scientific expertise in this field, interesting."
"I, however, consider it to be, above all, an expensive showpiece, from which the majority of people in Europe and our environment will not benefit."
"At most, it will be of military interest, certainly if the anti-militaristic considerations in the report are voted out."
"That is why I reject the proposal."
"The Alyssandrakis report has the value of acknowledging and underlining the remarkable efficiency of the European Space Agency, an intergovernmental body and major world player in the area of space research and space applications."
"The ESA sharply refutes those who, on ideological grounds, claim that intergovernmental cooperation can only lead to inefficiency and deadlocks."
"On the contrary, the ESA foreshadows the Europe of the future, one that will unite and draw together wills and skills varying from one domain to another."
"Our main task is therefore to preserve at all costs the partnership dynamic that has been launched between a number of States, which are aware of the crucial importance of the space industry for Europe' s independence."
"The ESA is fortunate in that it escapes the cumbersome bureaucracy of paralysing procedures."
"Let us take good care, therefore, to keep the ESA out of the Community loop, which in no way prevents us contemplating various methods of cooperating and working together."
"Let us, above all, try to avoid turning the ESA into a European institution."
"It would not make any sense to do this either, because some members of the Agency, large members at that, are not members of the European Union."
"Our second task, as the rapporteur points out, is to retain the high level of technological capability that we have gained by granting 'substantial and sustained public support for space development in the various forms we see in our competitors: dual programmes and massive research aid' ."
"The absurd deadlock over Galileo, which means that we remain dependent on external systems in the fundamental area of satellite navigation, shows, on the contrary, to what desperate impasses the Community method can lead."
"The ability of a few, more flexible, links in the chain to cause deadlock is enough to paralyse a project that is crucial to European independence."
"Miguélez Ramos report (A5-0470/2001)"
"Madam President, I have had a dream which concerns the Ramos report on fisheries."
"I saw a lake in a storm: a lake in Palestine at the time of Jesus."
"Indeed, I could see the figure of Jesus fishing in a boat together with Saint Peter, but Saint Peter' s face looked like Mr Varela' s."
"He was fishing but he had not caught any fish."
"Surprised, he asked Jesus, 'What is going on?"
"Aren' t there any fish?'"
"'Of course there are,' was the reply, 'this is 2001, you know, not the first century A.D.!"
"The thing is, nowadays, we have to have equality between men and women."
"Therefore, only if there is a woman fishing will there be large catches of fish once more."
"Therefore, Mr Fatuzzo, you who can see me in your dream, remember that, since this is a report by a woman, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, this is the right direction to take to achieve successful fisheries in the European Union."
"Vote for the motion, therefore, and you will see how many fish Europe catches!'"
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the report she has presented, which makes a positive contribution to the debate on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I should like, however, to emphasise two points on which the rapporteur adopts a different approach to the one I have advocated and which I feel are of vital importance to this discussion."
"In her report, the rapporteur calls for a redefinition of zones which are highly dependent on fishing, implementing the principle of relative stability and distributing available resources according to the actual degree of dependence on fishing."
"I consider, however, that keeping control of this distribution is essential, as is establishing mechanisms to correct the distribution whenever justified."
"We cannot forget that there are areas, such as the outermost regions, that are highly dependent, socially and economically, on fishing activities and for which, on the basis of Article 299 of the Treaty, the system of limiting access within 50 miles must be maintained."
"Both the Commission and the rapporteur have declined to address a situation which is having an increasingly significant impact on overall catches, namely leisure fishing."
"This activity has still not been regulated and, consequently, is not covered by the rules governing fishing."
". Every effort has been made to coincide with the proposed PSE line as far as possible, given that the original report faced great difficulties in committee and that conflicting national interests are at stake."
"Where the EPLP vote differs from the PSE line, the reasons for doing so are related to maintaining consistency with the UK government negotiating position on the future of the CFP."
"The EPLP vote differs from the PSE line on the following points: recital B, Amendments Nos 6, 24, 17 and 16, paragraphs 20, 12, 26 (original text), 45-47, 60, 64, 67, 68, 72, 73, 82, 84 and 91, Amendment No 5, paragraph 2 (part 2), Amendment No 3, and paragraphs 119 and 120."
"Hudghton report (A5-0458/2001)"
"As I have said on several occasions, Madam President, Fatuzzo rhymes with 'merluzzo' , which is the Italian word for cod! How, then, could I not speak on the subject of cod and hake?"
"Here, we are trying to save the cod and hake species from extinction, for marine pollution is reducing their numbers significantly year by year."
"Therefore, if I may make a suggestion, Madam President, after announcing that I voted for the motion and stressing that what this document says is right, could we not manage - at least where fish are concerned, seeing as it is difficult to do this with men - to clone cod and hake?"
"In this way, we really would be able to resolve the problem of restocking our waters; we would have loads of cod and loads of hake and we could all enjoy this excellent fisheries product!"
"The plan presented by the Commission unfairly penalises fishermen for whom cod is still a by-catch."
"The Commission is accusing the fishing industry of being to blame for causing stocks of the two species in question to decline, but it has, obviously, not taken proper account of the impact of industrial sand-eel fishing on the cod population."
"The sand-eel represents food to cod and it is the declining stocks of sand-eels that are causing the imbalance in the cod population."
"As far as hake is concerned, the situation no longer appears to be as 'disastrous' as the Commission believed six months ago, and this is confirmed by the TAC that has been retained for 2002."
"The TAC is slightly higher than the level we were given in 2001."
"This is a timely reminder of the modesty attributed to biologists, whose opinions are the only ones governing the current CFP."
"The ICES estimates seem to be needlessly alarmist in nature, especially as far as hake is concerned, the population of which, it seems, has begun to recover."
"The proposed measures are therefore not the right ones."
"Moreover, the Commission itself acknowledges that it is going beyond the scientific recommendations."
"Furthermore, there is, at a point when the Commission is making statements of intent regarding good governance in the Green Paper, a complete lack of consultation with the profession."
"What a difference there is between what is in theory said, and what in fact is done!"
"Lavarra report (A5-0457/2001)"
"Madam President, as usual, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by my final explanation of vote to say 'Bon apétit' to those Members - who, as you see, are many - who have had the patience to remain in the Chamber to hear why I voted for Mr Lavarra' s report on fisheries."
"Why should we not say 'Bon apétit' and have some exquisite, delicious fish for lunch?"
"The purpose of this report too - and these are the last reports on fish, which is why I have such a desire to have a delicious plate of fried fish on the table before me - is to exploit the fishing activity to obtain the greatest quantity of fish possible, in other words to catch the greatest possible number of fish."
"Mr Lavarra' s report maintains that this is possible if the fish live in a clean environment."
"I know that a large number of fish are getting together to form the 'Fish Green Party' , for fish have the right to live in a clean environment, just as we do."
"These fish will be so happy to be many and to end up frying in the pan to tickle the taste buds of the Members of the European Parliament, even if with some delay caused by Mr Fatuzzo."
"Bon apétit!"
". (EL) The report contains a mixture of undisputed findings and hypotheses and draws conclusions which, at the very least, force us to question the rapporteur's intentions."
"For example, its findings on the pollution of marine ecosystems - and hence of fish - by dioxins which can pass into the food chain are correct, as are its findings on the dangers of using genetically-modified fish from third countries."
"But apart from that, no accurate data are given to support its conclusions on the overexploitation of resources and the dangers to fish stocks."
"Unfortunately, the report fails to name and shame big business in the fishing and fish processing sector as the main cause of these problems."
"Big business is to blame for polluting the seas with sewage, dioxins and other contaminants; it has no compunction about using any methods in the production process which maximise its already obscene profits and is totally indifferent to the environmental implications."
"For the same reason, big business is now busy producing and releasing genetically modified organisms, fish etc. into the environment."
"It is big business in the fisheries sector, which runs huge fishing fleets of powerful, high-capacity vessels and huge processing factories to turn the fish into pet food etc., which is to blame for any overexploitation of resources and for polluting the seas."
"And while both the Commission proposal and the report fail to highlight the tragic consequences of this action and fail to hold it accountable, the report basically calls for fishing activities to be frozen by introducing ""biological rest areas"" and measures to develop aquaculture, which even the report itself questions at another point."
"If this policy takes hold, it will kill off entire regions of the ÅU which depend on fishing and will damage the interests of the small and medium-sized fishing enterprises which have no part in industrial pollution or the overfishing of resources."
"At the same time, the report uses incentives to replace the fishing fleet and incentives to strengthen aquaculture to reward industry, simply asking that it change direction."
"It is for these reasons that we are unable to vote in favour of the report."
"However, because certain issues and findings in the report are correct, we shall not vote against it."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I would like to draw to the House's attention the action of Levi Strauss, the jeans manufacturer, which is today closing two of its Scottish plants."
"650 Scots, mostly women, face the prospect tonight of losing their jobs and their livelihoods."
"Local politicians and trade unions are calling for meetings with the company."
"The lack of information and consultation by this company is quite a disgrace, showing more clearly the importance of proper information and consultation legislation prior to such a decision being announced."
"I would ask this House to show solidarity in supporting the workforce in Dundee and Bellshill and the families who have been affected by this decision today."
"I ask the President of Parliament to write to Levi Strauss to ask why it is shedding so many European jobs and why it has not properly consulted its workforce."
"Mutual recognition of financial penalties"
"The next item is the report (A5-0444/2001) by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative of the United Kingdom, the French Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden for the adoption of the Council Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition of financial penalties [11178/2001 - C5-0443/2001 - 2001/0825(CNS)]."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to express my satisfaction - as you have just done - with the initiative of the United Kingdom, France and Sweden, which we are considering today."
"The European Union and the existence of a European area of freedom, security and justice involve, in turn, the creation of an area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be guaranteed within the territory of the States of the Union, as laid down in Article 14 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"There can be no obstacles to the application of the law in the European Union."
"The Tampere Summit called for the principle of mutual recognition to become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters in the European Union."
"Trust between Member States in terms of their judicial decisions and their correct application is the least we must demand."
"Similarly, the Member States must make a greater effort in order to achieve a minimum degree of harmonisation of national criminal legislations."
"Until now, the application of financial penalties was regulated by means of two European agreements: the Hague Convention of 1970 and the Convention on the implementation of foreign criminal sentences of 1991."
"I would like to stress that the former, despite having entered into force, had only been ratified by five Member States; and the latter, the 1991 Convention, has not even entered into force."
"This is undoubtedly a clear demonstration of the need for initiatives of this type with a view to accelerating and making a genuine contributing to the construction of the European area of justice which we agreed on in Tampere."
"While various legal acts already exist in the civil field, in the criminal field - which is much more sensitive - there has been much more hesitation."
"To date, only decisions on arrests and the guaranteeing of evidence are based on the principle of mutual recognition."
"We still have a long road to travel and greater political will is required on the part of the Council in order to be able to fulfil the mandate of the Tampere Summit through the work prepared by the Commission, which often comes up against obstacles and little cooperation from the Council."
"This initiative represents a significant advance in terms of eliminating these obstacles."
"Mutual recognition is undoubtedly a key element for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Similarly, I welcome the legal instrument chosen: the framework decision, which will no doubt prevent the complexity and long duration of ratification procedures."
"I would also like to highlight the fact that, as in the conventions I have mentioned, it is based on the principle of dual criminality, and its absence is, therefore, one of the grounds for non-enforcement."
"The initiative proposes that a certificate by the competent authority should guarantee the legality of the judgement and hence replace examination of the substance of the case."
"The difficult problem of how to divide up the proceeds between the two States concerned is resolved in Article 10 by allotting compensation payments and orders to pay court costs to the Issuing State and all other monies to the Executing State."
"I therefore welcome the initiative and largely concur with it."
"I consider that a legal area as called for in Tampere requires the unbureaucratic transmission and enforcement of judgements in criminal cases and that this initiative is a first step towards a comprehensive application of the principle of mutual recognition."
"I particularly endorse the provisions relating to the law to be applied, alternative custodial penalties and the amnesty, pardon or commutation of financial penalties."
"I also support the scope for the Executing State to reduce the financial penalty as laid down in Article 5."
"However, I have considered it coherent to insert a threshold which, as in the agreement implementing the Schengen Convention, should be EUR 40, and I would like to emphasise that conversion of the amount of the penalties would be the exception as the currency in the Issuing and the Executing State would normally be the euro."
"I would like to stress that I personally consider EUR 40 to be a small and insufficient amount, but I have proposed this amount for the sake of coherence with the agreement implementing Schengen, which set that amount."
"I would like to insist on both issues, and ask the Council - which is not present today by the way - to take account of the sensitivity and proposals of this House and, in particular, of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and I therefore believe that the initiative must include the following in the framework decision:"
"A European legal area must be based on the principle of mutual recognition."
"Therefore, the mere harmonisation of legal instruments is not sufficient."
"The European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights sums up, for the first time in the Union' s history, in a single text, all of the civil, political, economic and social rights of the European citizens, and those of all the people who live in the Union' s territory."
"From now on, all of the Union' s legal instruments must be measured in relation to it."
"Thirdly, the documents to be transmitted must be translated into all official languages of the Executing State."
"If the person liable to pay the fine or even go to prison knows only one of the official languages of the executing country he would not be able to read these documents affecting him, which would be an infringement of his rights."
"Finally, it is necessary that, in those cases in which the competent authority of the Executing State is not known, the contact points of the European judicial network should be used rather than designating additional central contact points."
"Therefore, the majority of the amendments have been tabled with the sole objective of improving the original proposal and contributing to compliance with the Tampere mandate, as well as adding one more element to the construction of a genuine area of justice, freedom and security."
"Madam President, it is a joy to see you occupying the President' s chair."
"Allow me to start my contribution in this full Chamber by explaining that my group considers it to be a positive development that a lack of boundaries does not lead to impunity."
"It will not be possible for a non-EU citizen to abuse his status in order to break laws or, for example, traffic rules."
"We will soon be agreed on this."
"The problem my group has is that the implications of this initiative of a few Member States, and the subsequent report, are not restricted to administrative penalties."
"Much more is at stake, including decisions through which those convicted may acquire criminal records."
"Serious allegations may even be involved since, in some countries, thanks to the day penalty system, custodial sentences can be exchanged for financial penalties."
"In those cases, therefore, what is at issue is the recognition of decisions in the field of criminal law."
"Amendment No 1 of the report rightly contains the following comment, and I quote: ""This requires a knowledge of the legal systems of other Member States and mutual trust in the operation of the legal system."" and this is true."
"But how does one promote this trust, how does one examine whether legal systems are fair, and how does one guarantee citizens a minimum level of protection across Europe, for example in connection with the enquiry which precedes the sentence?"
"Well, this brings me back to what I have been saying all along about drafting minimum standards in the field of penal and criminal procedures law."
"This is important now, and it will be no less important when enlargement is a reality."
"My group wholeheartedly supports these administrative penalties and the principle of criminal penalties, but not until we have formally established the basis for trust by means of the minimum standards."
"This is why my group proposes restricting this decision to these administrative penalties."
"Madam President, criminal law is closely related to the national identity of the Member States."
"National history and culture have given different tinges to criminal law systems."
"This is precisely the reason why we can see huge differences between the criminal law systems in the European Union."
"The open European area and growing international crime have shown that cooperation in this field is necessary in order to ensure that the Union remains an area of security and justice."
"After all, the European Council of Tampere subscribed to the principle of mutual recognition within the European Union in criminal matters with good reason."
"The present proposal forms a first step in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition."
"I welcome the initiative by the United Kingdom, France and Sweden to make a start on mutual recognition in criminal matters in this reasonably straightforward area."
"The proposal is quite simply designed."
"Theoretically, the principle of dual criminality applies, that is to say in both the Issuing and Executing States."
"The lack of this is a reason for the Executing State not to implement the sanction."
"Precisely because of the proposal' s simplicity, it might actually be far more effective than the international treaties have been so far."
"Many in this Parliament would prefer a proposal to harmonise criminal legislation."
"They believe that harmonisation at European level would lead to more confidence in the criminal legislation of other Member States and in the application thereof."
"I doubt whether that is true."
"Confidence cannot be enforced from above by harmonising legislation."
"It is precisely in those cases where diversity can continue to exist, and is even considered to provide added value, that mutual trust can grow."
"And practical experience is often the best way of achieving this trust, or not, as the case may be."
"This is why this mutual recognition is the ideal tool for cooperating in this sensitive area."
"And it is true that mutual cooperation in the field of criminal law will take time in other areas due to the need for mutual recognition."
"But if it takes its time, this also means that trust has apparently not reached the required level."
"Wanting to force this trust by imposing harmonisation may well have the opposite effect."
"In the main, the amendments of the Cerdeira Monterero report are practical improvements."
"I particularly support the rapporteur' s proposal that use be made of the contact points of the European judicial network and no new contact points set up."
"After all, this would unnecessarily complicate European judicial cooperation."
"I do not support Amendment No 3, where the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is added as a frame of reference for decisions by the Union."
"The Charter has, rather, the status of a political declaration and not that of a judicial frame of reference."
"The ECHR on the other hand, that has been signed by all the EU' s Member States, present and future, is legally enforceable."
"The suggestion made to the effect that the texts are on the same footing is incorrect."
"Madam President, we welcome this initiative as another small step along the road towards fulfilling the Tampere mandate to make the principle of mutual recognition the cornerstone of judicial cooperation."
"It is right that within a developing area of freedom, security and justice Member States ought to begin laying the foundations for establishing trust in each other's legal systems."
"We need an EU legislative initiative to facilitate efficient cross-border cooperation and improve upon previous international legal instruments, which are often cumbersome and bureaucratic."
"Indeed, the 1991 Convention on the enforcement of criminal sentences - which otherwise would be relevant here - is not yet in force some ten years after it was signed."
"It is right for the EU to base cooperation on the concept of executing the decision of the issuing State, rather than that of deciding whether or not to grant cooperation in response to a request."
"The other international convention - the 1970 Convention - contains 13 grounds on which a request can be refused, so we can understand why the system does not work at the moment."
"However, many of us in this House are concerned not to allow the principle of mutual recognition to undermine the rights of the individual and in this field generally it is essential that the legal safeguards outlined not only in the European Convention on Human Rights but also, I would say to Mr Blokland, in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - which ought to be legally enforceable - should be observed."
"My group would certainly agree with Mrs Cerdeira Morterero that we should use the existing system of contact points in the European Judicial Network, as it is pointless to keep reinventing the wheel with different systems of contact points for various initiatives."
"However, we have a core problem here: people who care about civil liberties - and here I include myself - are put on the spot about agreeing to measures of mutual recognition without having a comprehensive programme to raise the standard of observance of individual rights."
"My group believes that we need a comprehensive approach to this, and we are very much looking forward to the Commission White Paper on this subject."
"I have been reproached for agreeing to the European arrest warrant, while very strongly supporting individual rights."
"It is a challenge to all of us - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - to put in place those safeguards, because it is difficult to keep on agreeing until we have them."
"But my group believes that, with the Eurosceptics of the Right objecting to any cooperation in this field, we have to say that those of us who are not on the Right, who care about civil liberties, should agree to these measures but then put pressure on the Commission and the Council to have these citizens' safeguards."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too wish to offer my particular congratulations to Mrs Cederschiöld on her election as Vice-President of this Parliament."
"The Commission welcomes the initiative we are debating today of the United Kingdom, the Republic of France and the Kingdom of Sweden which seeks to guarantee the mutual recognition of financial penalties."
"It is worth pointing out that this issue was addressed in the Commission communication on the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, which we issued and debated here in the European Parliament in July 2000."
"The need for this specific instrument was identified in the programme of measures designed to apply the principle of the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters adopted by the Council and the Commission in November 2000."
"I wish to thank Mrs Morterero, in particular, for her excellent report."
"As she quite rightly stated, there is no international instrument currently in place in all of our Member States for the application of financial penalties in criminal matters."
"There are only the two instruments to which the honourable Member referred, but one of them has never come into force and the other has only been ratified by five Member States."
"This means that what we are discussing today is the first European Union instrument in this field, which, I think, we also want to be ambitious."
"This instrument will implement the principle of mutual recognition through the application of cross-border financial penalties, thereby ensuring that there will be no safe havens in the Union for those who attempt to escape the application of financial penalties set by the competent authorities of the Member States."
"This instrument will strengthen the progress made in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition by means of the Council' s approval of the Commission proposal on the European arrest order."
"As Baroness Ludford has already said, the Commission is working on an initiative intended to identify the basic principles and criteria for the legal protection of European citizens' fundamental rights in criminal matters."
"It is also worth pointing out, however, that we are not, in this field, working with a blank piece of paper: we are working within a legal framework which exists and which is - if I may say so - consolidated."
"All the Member States have signed up to and joined the European Convention on Human Rights, all the Member States have legal systems of criminal prosecution that are subject to the supervision of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and all the Member States have jointly proclaimed, in political though not legal terms, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"These are legal and political instruments that enable us to establish a frame of reference within which we can implement the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters."
"The Commission broadly agrees with the approach adopted in all of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur."
"We understand the basis of the proposal on setting a minimum threshold of EUR 40 for the principle to be implemented because, in some cases, unless there is a minimum charge of EUR 40, the costs of transfer and implementation would not justify the execution of the judgment."
"I fully understand the criterion of EUR 40, which has been imported, shall we say, from the Schengen Agreement."
"I simply wish to point out that the wording should be sufficiently careful as not to give the idea that we are allowing the mere fact that a border has been crossed to be a way of escaping criminal liability, even if this is, in financial terms, quite limited."
"Finally, I should like, once again, to thank Mrs Morterero for the positive and innovative spirit of her report and express my hopes that this will be adopted by the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"Training and recruitment of seafarers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0450/2001) by Mrs Kauppi on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication on the training and recruitment of seafarers [COM(2001) 188 - C5-0468/2001 - 2001/2188(COS)]."
"Madam President, I also wish to congratulate you on your new task which you have begun today."
"From a Finnish point of view, I am really pleased to see Scandinavian colours in the presidency."
"Madam President, Europeans have been seafarers since the earliest decades of history."
"Not only European integration but the growing together of Europe has its first roots in the sea voyages of antiquity which took merchants and explorers from the east coast of the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and to the British Isles."
"But globalisation, our globe that is growing ever closer, began with sea travels that made contacts between people on different continents possible."
"The maritime sector has throughout the course of European history played a crucial role in the political, economic, social and scientific development of our nations."
"Seafaring and ship building remain crucial fields of activity in today's European Union."
"The merchant shipping sector is, for example, of strategic importance to the economic well-being of the European Union."
"The last two decades have unfortunately seen a sharp decline in the number of EU seafarers."
"This is caused mainly by two factors."
"First, EU shipowners have a lower demand for EU seafarers because of financial considerations."
"Third-country nationals who might not be as highly educated and trained as their EU colleagues are employed instead."
"Secondly, the supply of well-qualified EU seafarers is declining since fewer and fewer young Europeans choose maritime careers."
"A number of the causes that underlie the unwillingness of young Europeans to choose maritime careers can clearly be identified."
"Community and international law on living and working conditions is inadequately applied on EU merchant vessels."
"Modern technologies are not used enough to improve living and working conditions on board."
"National authorities and the social partners will have to step up their efforts and see to it that existing legislation is fully applied."
"Maritime training in the EU needs to be developed further."
"A high-quality system of maritime education and training is vital to the future of EU seafaring."
"I encourage, therefore, the building of networks between the academic institutions for seafarers' education and training."
"Cooperation between training institutions and companies in this sector should be increased."
"For example, the sharing of facilities and specialisation may allow institutions to purchase capital equipment and to launch courses for the new target groups."
"The Community offers financial support for training and human resource development, so these should be used to their full extent."
"I urge Member States and social partners to exploit fully all possibilities of funding, such as the European Social Fund, Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes."
"The existing Community funds should be used to supplement existing funding from national and regional budgets for maritime education and training."
"The Commission communication is an excellent resumé of the current situation."
"We in Parliament thus ask the Commission to enlarge its valuable analyses further."
"Employment and training of seafarers depends closely on the market conditions of the maritime transport sector."
"I therefore urge the Commission also to provide an analysis of the underlying economic variables relating to maritime transport, in particular with regard to the competitive position of the EU fleet."
"The industry, in discussion with MET institutes and the social partners, should intensify its efforts to develop career paths, training and job content that take account of opportunities available in the wider maritime sector, following time employed at sea."
"I will summarise by saying that the shortfall of EU seafarers in general, of well-trained personnel, is likely to have negative consequences as far as safe navigation, number of accidents and marine pollution are concerned."
"These accidents are mostly caused by human error."
"There is a clear need to safeguard the employment of EU seafarers on board and on shore, to preserve the maritime know-how in the Community, to develop maritime skills and to improve the safety of maritime transport."
"This requires high-standard training possibilities as well as adequate employment and career prospects."
"The responsibility for the necessary action is shared between the industry, the social partners and the Member States' authorities."
"But you clearly know that the Commission has a big role to play in this area."
"Madam President, I too would like to express my best wishes for your term of office."
"It is with great pleasure that I speak on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who sent me to this beautiful city of Strasbourg to attempt to remind people of their existence."
"Mr Kauppi' s document, whose content, proposals and analysis of the difficult situation of seafarers I fully support, takes me back in time to when I was the age Mrs Kauppi is now."
"I was not a member of a parliament, I sailed in the ships which take American tourists from New York to the Bahamas and vice versa."
"Being a seafarer myself, I met a number of people who worked on the ships."
"At that time, seafarers were fortunate individuals with extremely high wages; jobs as crewmembers of both passenger and cargo ships and even oil tankers were sought after."
"However, now, 35 years on, I have met friends who used to sail with me again and they tell me that everything is different now, for the ships that sail the seas of Europe are now manned by Indonesian and Colombian seafarers and seafarers from all the world' s poor States, and their wages are a maximum of EUR 100/150 per month, that is less than 10% of the wages of European seafarers."
"I therefore feel we must work to ensure that, whatever the flag flying on the ships sailing the European seas, the crewmembers have agreements laying down the same wages as those of workers on dry land."
"Seafarers must not be exploited on European ships just because they come from poor regions of the world."
"Madam President, despite being a woman of the South and not being a seafarer, which is a shame, because this sector still remains largely closed to women, I do not wish to miss this opportunity also to congratulate you on your new position."
"I should also like to begin by congratulating both the Commission and the rapporteur, who highlights some of the aspects of strategic importance to maintaining the high professional standards that it is considered will meet the needs that the Union is going to have if it wishes to maintain, and put into practice, a mechanism on which it legislated recently, intended to ensure maritime safety. This mechanism requires a new professional approach in ports, new competences in the field of inspections and, above all, new requirements for the seafarers working in the Union' s exclusive economic zone."
"It is true that all of these matters fall within the competence of Member States, but we have already seen that, in the field of safety, if there is no strategy there will be no effectiveness."
"We also know that 80% of accidents are attributed to crewmembers."
"This is an unacceptable factor, which has its roots in the fact that our ship-owners, and our entire maritime transport system, are dependent on a single factor that is decisive in human activity, for reasons of competitiveness and of the very survival of the industry, but which must be regulated within the Community and also in the international institutions, whether it be the IMO or the ILO."
"And yet, on this matter, the Member States have had no development strategy in place."
"Employment has fallen in this sector by 40% and salaries have also decreased. This has led to these professions, especially those of experienced officers, who are essential for navigating the specific coastal characteristics of the Union and for meeting the needs that I have mentioned, being taken over by citizens of third countries who do not even share the same language or the same ability to communicate."
"This is why, Madam President, we repeat that the Commission must regulate and harmonise not only training courses but also pay and living conditions on board and the safety of crewmembers, and it must also act together with other economic blocs that have unilaterally expanded the market, leaving it uncontrolled, or which have established protectionist practices, as the United States has done."
"We feel that the Commission is genuinely able to ensure - and is on the way to doing so - that the Member States continue to supply high-quality seafarers, in order not only to do justice to our past but also to our future."
"Madam President, I congratulate Mrs Kauppi on this report."
"I have to admit that representing London I do not have too many fishermen in my constituency and I am delighted to be able to put forward a few comments on behalf of Mrs Scallon who, unfortunately, cannot be here today as she has a pressing engagement."
"She has followed this dossier very carefully because of the large fishing industry in her constituency in Ireland."
"I should like to pass on her and my thanks to the Commission for focusing on this important issue."
"When speaking to stakeholders in this industry, Mrs Scallon found that they were very concerned about the concept of flagging out, which was one of the root causes of the sharp decline in EU seafarers and the increase in the use of third-country ratings and junior officers."
"EU crew members suffer a severe competitive disadvantage; with their working conditions of working one week on, one week off with full pay on passenger ferries, they find it very difficult to compete with non-EU crew members working nine months on, and one month off without pay."
"As a result, there are few training places available for EU junior officers and ratings and, sadly, redundancy is being offered to many in this industry in the EU."
"In line with many of the points highlighted in the report, Mrs Scallon heard that there was concern regarding the lower standard of EU training and the possible danger to public safety that might be caused by language difficulties with multilingual crews, where no translation was available."
"Both Mrs Scallon and I would definitely like to see more training places available if we are to stop this decline."
"Experienced seafarers are also ideal for other temporary, onshore work off-season in areas such as recruitment, training, freight forwarding, insurance and arbitration."
"As part of the suggested awareness campaign, we should also look at the possibility of funding the promotion of seafaring at secondary-school level."
"Mrs Scallon closed by remarking that it was sad that even in the fishing villages of her own country, seafaring, rowing and sailing were not subjects which played a great part in the curriculum."
"That is something that we both regret."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5 p.m."
"Leonardo da Vinci programme (1995-1999)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0449/2001) by Mrs Stauner on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission's final report on the implementation of the first phase of the Community action programme Leonardo da Vinci (1995-1999) [COM(2000) 863 - 2001/2069(INI)]."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too congratulate you, Madam President, on your new position."
"I am glad that we are able to welcome another woman to the podium."
"I was looking forward to speaking on my report on the implementation of the first phase of the Community action programme Leonardo da Vinci, but I received this morning a piece of news which obliges me to go about this differently."
"According to this information, the veracity of which I have no reason to doubt, the Commission has since 31 August 2001 been in possession of a report which, and I quote, indicates 'possible irregularities and possible professional wrongdoing within the Commission' in the implementation of the first phase of Leonardo."
"According to this report, both OLAF, the anti-fraud office, and also the Commission are apparently either carrying out an investigation or have reopened the investigation that was carried out in 1999-2000."
"A representative of the Commission confirmed to me by telephone a couple of hours ago the existence of such a report on that subject."
"I could not contact OLAF's director and so have been unable to verify what that authority has been doing."
"As, then, there are obviously significant items of information indicating deficiencies in this programme over and above those already brought to light, my report has, one might say, ceased to have a procedural basis."
"On behalf of the PPE group, to which I belong, I therefore ask that today's debate and vote be cancelled and that the report be referred back to the competent committee, so that I can gather appropriate information and present a report containing all documents and items of information that there actually are on the subject."
"I would, though, like to ask the Commissioner present to enlighten this House as to why the Commission, despite my having had a meeting with a Commission representative only yesterday, did not inform me or the honourable Members of this House about this report."
"I beg to observe that the withholding of reports and items of information as significant as this does not honour the principle of trustful cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, and that I personally am very disappointed by this course of action."
"(The matter was referred back to the committee responsible)"
"Madam President, I asked for the Commissioner to speak before we took a decision because Mrs Stauner raised an important question and we did not hear the Commissioner's reply."
"What is going on?"
"Did this happen or not?"
"And for us then to decide."
"I fail to understand how we can take a decision without the Commissioner's reply."
"Besides, I saw for myself that the Commissioner asked to speak."
"I realise that, but I have to comply with Rule 144 of Parliament' s Rules of Procedure."
"We must therefore proceed in this way."
"I would like to say the following in support of Mr Koukiadis. I thought that somewhere in the Rules of Procedure - I was unable to look it up in this short space of time - it is stipulated that the Commission can be asked to comment on any point that is presented."
"I think it good that this should happen in this case, and I have the impression that the Commission is also willing to comment."
"I thought that it was a general rule in this House that if the Commission wishes to speak out on something, it actually does so."
"This is only a rare event because issues like these hardly ever get into the news so suddenly but, in this case, I think we ought to create a precedent and that the Commission, if it so wishes, should be able to make a statement in a case like this, especially because its own role is at issue and, otherwise, widespread confusion could be created in the press."
"Madam President, I should like to insist emphatically that this statement be made and I do not think that it should take very long."
"In principle, I share Mr Pronk' s view."
"Unfortunately, the Rules of Procedure do not allow that possibility, but we may well address this matter as part of the ongoing review of the Rules of Procedure."
"In fact, I seem to remember that a general option of this kind is to be introduced, and that would no doubt be appropriate."
"Because we have now referred the matter back to the committee, I must formally follow the rules."
"We can probably allow the Commissioner to take the floor in order to present his points of view, in spite of the fact that we have already made a decision."
"However, we cannot of course change a decision that has already been made."
"Madam President, I asked to speak but I did not want to break the Rules of the House."
"When you called for one speaker in favour of and one speaker against the decision to postpone the report by Mrs Stauner, I did not like to speak because I am not supposed to take a position on that."
"Nevertheless, I should like to stress that the Commission has informed the House a number of times that both our Directorate-General for Administration and OLAF are currently examining a lengthy report into several allegations by a Commission official of possible irregularities within the Commission in relation to a variety of issues."
"As I have said, the examination of the report by OLAF and the DG for Administration is ongoing."
"They have not yet reached a conclusion as to whether the report contains new elements in relation to Leonardo that would require further investigation."
"I have been told by my colleagues who are directly responsible for these matters that they will reach their conclusions shortly."
"Madam President, I do not want there to be any misunderstandings about this."
"Commissioner, I am obliged to you for your statement."
"I was certainly not aware that you had entrusted this Commission official with the task of producing a conclusive report by 31 August, but I then learned of this, not from the Commission, but from other sources."
"Do you, though, not think it a matter of trustful cooperation or proper administrative procedure that you should at least inform the rapporteur when a report completing the evaluation of a particular stage of an action programme is coming out?"
"It is at Leonardo that new accusations are levelled in this report."
"I practically have to assume that you wanted to have your innocence certified by Parliament, and then, when perhaps in about another six months' time, it came out that yet more scandalous things had been going on, it would be easy for you to say: 'Oh please, Parliament sanctioned what we did!'"
"Please stick to the rules of fair play."
"If there is to be a general report, I will not be able tell whether there is perhaps something about Leonardo I in it."
"Because the matter has been referred back to the committee, the debate will not now take place."
"Basle II"
"The next item is an oral question (B5-0001/2002) put by Mr Karas, Mr Radwan and Mrs Villiers to the Commission on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on Basle II - own funds for credit institutions."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by saying that I am very glad that it is under your presidency that I have been called to speak, as I rejoice to see you in Parliament's new bureau."
"The reason why the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has addressed this question to the Commission is that we want, after the Villiers report, prior to the presentation of the third consultative document and before the Commission complete the draft Directive, to give a clear signal to the public and to the enterprises affected that we speak for the affected parties in the Directive's drafting process and that we want to be more involved in the discussion process, both as regards the monitoring of the Basle Committee and also the preparation of the Directive."
"The basic conception of Basle II, of closer alignment of the capital base of banks to the actual risks, is in our view something to be welcomed."
"What is of the essence, though, is what form it should take in practice, as it is only through a conversion appropriate to our economic structure that the financial sector including an essential pillar of the economy and its enterprises, above all the small and medium-sized ones, can actually be strengthened."
"The previous proposals by the Basle Committee on banking supervision are, in our present view, still unsatisfactory, and we believe that they should, in many instances, undergo thorough revision."
"Our question today is prompted by our economic structure."
"Eighteen million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe create 75% of European jobs and pay 80% of the taxes."
"These enterprises' capital costs are therefore crucial to their competitiveness and to the maintenance of the small and medium-scale economic structure."
"We believe, Commissioner, that the Commission - and I would also like to know what you intend doing about this - should be an intermediary between the six Member States of the European Union that are not members of the Basle Committee and the nine that are, and that we really must do everything we can to ensure that the Nine really do represent the Fifteen."
"It is only if this happens that I can regard it as at all feasible to incorporate the Basle result unchanged into the draft Directive, as Commissioner Bolkestein has said in his statement."
"If this does not happen, all the various opinions will find their way into discussion of the Directive, leaving Parliament, the Commission and the Council far less room to manoeuvre."
"It is for this reason that we, that is Mr Radwan, Mrs Villiers and I, have put a number of questions to you, which we urgently want to have answered when the Directive is drafted."
"They relate to the consequential costs for small and medium-sized enterprises and to the issue of flexibility in the Directive's application to small and medium-sized enterprises and to banks; they also relate to the date on which the Directive will enter into force and to the Commission's role as co-ordinator between the nine represented on the Basle Committee and the six not represented on it."
"The question takes up the cause of the medium-scale economic structures in Europe and is intended to give voice to the questions that small and medium-sized banks and enterprises want to ask."
"We look forward to you giving definite answers to them."
"Madam President, on behalf of my colleague I would like to start by saying that the review of capital adequacy is an extremely significant project forming part of the Commission's financial services action plan."
"The aim is, as mentioned, to modernise the existing capital requirements for banks and investment firms."
"This will lead to significant benefits within the European financial services markets in terms of increased efficiency and enhanced competition, while at the same time improving financial stability through prudential requirements that are both more comprehensive and more sensitive to the risks faced by these institutions."
"The European review is taking place in parallel with the review by the Basle Committee on banking supervision of capital requirements for internationally active banks."
"Before going on to specific questions, let me mention that excellent progress has been made but the review is still ongoing."
"My response to your questions should therefore be read in that light."
"As regards the internal ratings-based approach and smaller banks, the framework likely to be proposed will be based on an evolutionary and flexible approach."
"Different approaches will be used by institutions depending upon the level of sophistication they wish to adopt - their risk management practices and so on. The significance of the IRB approach has already been identified in Parliament's resolution of 17 November 2000 on the evaluation of the own funds directive."
"The IRB approach should be designed prudently but in such a way as not to unduly exclude smaller and less complex institutions."
"The Commission has pursued the above from the beginning, both in preparing its proposal and in participating in the Basle process."
"To accommodate the needs of smaller and less complex institutions, the second Commission consultative document of February 2001 diverged on specific issues from the Basle consultative document."
"Particular focus was put on the Basle minimum standards, which were modified to make them more appropriate to the European Union context."
"For example, the Commission's consultation paper proposed requiring institutions to apply the IRB approach to all material exposure classes."
"This will give institutions the possibility to exempt from the IRB approach portfolios that are immaterial."
"This means applying a partial use approach."
"The Commission believes that such flexibility strikes an appropriate balance in the European Union context."
"Another aspect included in the Commission's second consultative document was the proposal to allow banks to use pooled data in estimating the probability of default of borrowers."
"This will allow smaller institutions to overcome the possibility that their individual amounts of data will be too small to be statistically meaningful and to rely, where appropriate, on an internal rating system developed by a banking association."
"On the potential effect of the new regime on the cost of lending to SMEs, both the Commission and the Basle Committee have strongly emphasised the importance of ensuring that the capital adequacy regime leads to appropriate treatment of credit to SMEs."
"During 2001 significant progress was made on this aspect and the Commission is committed to a successful outcome in this significant issue."
"A modified risk-weight curve for corporate exposures has been developed, which is likely to reduce the capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the proposals in the second consultative document."
"Recognition is likely to be given in the IRB approach to a wider range of collateral."
"I will say more about this in a moment."
"Work has continued on the development of risk-weight proposals in respect of retail lending."
"In the IRB approaches these are lower than for lending to corporates."
"Retail lending is likely to be defined in such a way that small business loans that are treated as retail loans by a bank and that meet the other relevant criteria will fall within the retail risks weight."
"That will benefit the regulatory capital charges of relevant small-business loans, while maintaining appropriate levels of prudential soundness."
"The question of recognition of a wider range of collateral in the IRB approach has received a good deal of attention during 2001."
"This is of particular importance in the context of lending to SMEs."
"The emerging thinking is to recognise a broader range of collateral than was previously proposed."
"The likelihood is that the approach will be not to name specific types of physical collateral that will be acceptable, but to set eligibility criteria that seek to ensure a certain sustainable value of the collateral in the event of borrower default."
"It is envisaged that appropriate recognition will also be given in the IRB approach to situations where loans are secured against receivables and that the risk mitigation aspects of financial leases will be appropriately recognised."
"Consideration is also being given to recognising the practice whereby life insurance policies are placed with the lending institution as security for a loan."
"I now turn to the fifth question on implementation of the new Basle Accord, concerning the question of uniformity and flexibility and the date of implementation."
"On the question of uniformity of application and flexibility, it is important to state once again that the new framework will be based on an evolutionary approach."
"It is designed to be used differently by institutions of different sizes and complexity."
"A key focus of the Commission's efforts lies in ensuring that the specific features of the European Union context, including the wider range of institutions to which the regime will apply, are fully reflected in this new regime."
"For reasons of competitive neutrality, the European Union legislative framework for banks and investment firms is based on the principle of equality of treatment between competing institutions, at least as regards certain business and market segments."
"For this reason, a capital adequacy regime that is profoundly innovative, should not be introduced for only one category of institution."
"For reasons of international competitive equity, it is very important that European Union institutions move to the new framework within the same timescale as institutions of other jurisdictions, including, for example, the United States."
"The target date for implementation is 2005."
"The Commission intends to adopt the proposal for a directive shortly after final agreement is reached in Basle."
"This, together with the full and thorough consultative process that is taking place in order to produce a very high-quality proposal, will enable the Commission to contribute to the fullest extent to a process which will allow legislation to be adopted in good time to achieve the accord implementation date."
"The importance of rapid implementation of the new framework was recognised in the resolution of this Parliament of November 2000 on the evaluation of the own funds Directive."
"On the sixth question, I would say that the Commission is aware of the concerns of some commentators, including some Member States, that the treatment of the maturity dimension proposed in the second consultative document could create competitive disadvantages for banks which typically grant long-term loans."
"This matter is still being considered in Basle."
"On the seventh question, regarding limit retail loans, the Commission believes that the borderline between corporate loans and retail loans should be such as to allow certain kinds of lending to SMEs to be treated as retail in nature."
"The question of where exactly the cut-off point between a retail loan and a non-retail loan should be, is subject to ongoing consideration."
"The definition currently proposed in the IRB framework includes a use test, whereby such a loan can be treated as retail in nature if is treated in the institution's risk-management systems and assessments in the same manner as other retail loans and meets the other relevant criteria, including those in relation to value."
"The Commission regards this approach as useful and effective."
"The Commission recognises the special risk characteristics associated with home loans."
"It also recognises that European residential mortgage markets have different features from other mortgage markets in the world and that they are of particular importance to the European Union banking system."
"Work is continuing to develop an appropriate treatment for loans of this type."
"Finally, on the eighth question - regarding coordination between the nine EU Member States that are members of the Basle Committee and the other European Union Member States - the European Union perspective is indeed strongly represented in the Basle Committee."
"Spain joined the Basle Committee last year, which brings the total number of EU countries on the committee to 9 out of 13."
"The Commission sits as an observer on the committee, as does the European Central Bank."
"This has allowed the views of the European Union as a whole to be conveyed, as reflected in the recent development of the Basle proposals, in the review of the capital requirements applicable to lending to SMEs, and in the wider recognition of collateral."
"The work of the Banking Advisory Committee is very important in this regard."
"The BAC is an advisory committee to the Commission, bringing together banking supervisors and regulators."
"The authorities responsible for the prudential supervision of investment firms have been invited to participate in discussions of the capital review."
"A dedicated working structure has been established to assist in developing concrete proposals that should address EU concerns, in particular as regards the application of the capital framework to a wide range of institutions, including smaller banks and investment firms."
"To conclude, let me say that the Commission considers that very good progress has been made."
"Of course further important work remains to be done before the third consultative document is published later in the year."
"The Commission looks forward to finalising this work and adopting a legislative proposal so that the new regime can be introduced in a timely manner."
"Finally, the Commission regards it as important to the process that Parliament be kept informed of the Commission's developing thinking in relation to the potential proposal for a new capital adequacy regime."
"Commissioner Bolkestein has just this week written to the chairman of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee to suggest that it might be useful to arrange a meeting where members of the committee could be apprised by Commission experts in greater detail as to the emerging thinking in relation to the capital adequacy review."
"I thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and informative presentation."
"I very much welcome what you said about the flexibility and evolutionary approach with regard to the internal ratings-based approach."
"It is vital that this risk-sensitive framework should be potentially applicable to a wide range of credit institutions, both large and small."
"I also welcome what you said about pooled data, which is essential to ensuring that smaller institutions can take advantage of a new risk-sensitive framework by pooling data with similar, smaller institutions."
"I further welcome what you said about the modified risk weight curve and retail lending and collateral."
"All these issues are going to be vitally important in ensuring that the new framework is adaptable to the diversity of large and small credit institutions and investment firms in the European Union."
"I welcome a risk-sensitive framework."
"There is no need for a more sophisticated and risk-sensitive framework to be more bureaucratic and costly."
"At all costs we want to ensure a fair balance for SMEs."
"There is no need for a risk-sensitive framework to make SME borrowing more expensive."
"I am confident that if the Commission and Parliament do their work properly we can devise a solution and a new accord which are risk-sensitive, protect savers, encourage systemic stability and ensure that small businesses can continue to have access to loan finance."
"In many cases I hope that this may even bring down the cost of lending for small businesses."
"It is vital that we get this right."
"I look forward to the further exchange of views that has been proposed."
"There is a great deal more work to be done, but I am encouraged by what I have heard so far in response to the question tabled by myself, Mr Karas and Mr Radwan."
"Madam President, in deference to your international linguistic approach, Commissioner, I will refrain from speaking in my national language and use the lingua franca of our epoch - English."
"I pay tribute to your valiant rendering, not only of the English language - in which you have no problem - but also of the specialised terminology of the financial markets, which probably caused you more throatache than the language itself."
"You paid tribute to the modernising efforts of the financial services programme."
"Indeed it is a remarkable programme, which has to succeed if we are going to have a unified and integrated capital market in Europe - a great competitive advantage for an economy."
"However, the word ""modernise"" can be such a terrible weasel word at the same time."
"Many things can be cloaked in modernism."
"In this particular case there is an upside, insofar as the integration of capital markets is helped; at the same time, however, the increasing leverage of financial institutions, inter alia, has already given rise to various risks will do so in the future."
"There have to be ways of strengthening control of those risk-management models which banks will use in order to assume control."
"Such models are very costly and hard to control."
"When I say ""control"" I do not mean control in the old-fashioned bureaucratic sense."
"New methods have to be invented for checking on these models so that they perform in a way that helps the banks perhaps to leverage more while at the same time keeping them in check."
"If they are not kept in check the risks could be very substantially increased."
"The other risk in this area is that we create a risk-management divide where big banks and big financial institutions will have all the means at their disposal to engage in modern risk management."
"Meanwhile, small banks will become more and more marginalised in this respect and be increasingly burdened with costs which the bigger institutions have managed to shrug off."
"If indeed a way out is to be sought through partial application to small banks, this may exacerbate the lack of transparency in the whole area."
"The recent Enron debacle offers a sobering lesson in what a lack of transparency could provoke."
"Therefore our advice would be to temper a little the enthusiasm for surrendering control to the markets, while building up the official control side a bit more and applying it in a modern way using modern methods."
"Such methods might, in the short term, limit profitability, but if they are to spare us a couple of Enron-type disasters in the long run, they will more than compensate for any reduction in short term profit."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank you, Commissioner, for your exhaustive reply."
"I share your view that substantial progress has been made in the Basle II discussion process so far."
"Mr Karas, and Mrs Villiers as well, have referred to a number of fundamental problems, especially with regard to the various financing structures in Europe, and we still have a whole range of problems to resolve."
"You were right to address the problem of internal and external ratings, where we have made progress, but, as you yourself have said, the crediting of securities and the time long-term credits take to be assessed as being of a significantly higher risk are all yet to be discussed in Basle."
"What emerged from Mrs Villiers' and Mr Karas' question today was important for me to learn, and so I ask you to add to it."
"There are two points still outstanding."
"One of them is, as before, how the Commission exerts influence in Basle - if it sees these problems in the same way that we do; I got that from their answer."
"You have, admittedly, mentioned the Member States - including Spain, the new one - but, at the end of the day, it is we who are the legislators."
"What matters is that it be made clear there how we envisage transposition."
"I would like to have a more definite statement from you on that."
"The second thing that interests me is this. We all hope that, in Basle, all the problems that preoccupy us in the parliamentary process here will be solved."
"After all, we cannot all take part. What happens, though, if they are not solved?"
"What view, then, for example, does the Commission take of something that has fundamental importance for Austria and Germany, namely, how we assess the value of long-term credits, if this problem is not resolved?"
"That is the question that arises in my mind, and there is still the statement by your colleague Commissioner Bolkestein, who is present here, that a 1:1 transposition is imperative."
"A statement like that leaves us relatively little room for movement in Basle."
"What ideas are there circulating within the Commission about the introduction of a degree of flexibility here?"
"At the same time, I would like to add that I would be very interested to know how you envisage the process of transposition."
"When Basle II is adopted - and you have yourself said that you are aiming for 2005 - it should all happen very fast."
"What we have heard from the Commission to date is that there will be a framework directive and then appendices to - as it is so elegantly phrased - deal with the technical details, and which will sort out the questions of a system of supervision as well."
"It will be a very rapid process."
"I would greatly welcome it if this working party linking Parliament and the Commission could start very soon, in order to get those within Parliament who are interested - and we three from the group of the European People's Party/European Democrats are very much so - involved in the process in good time and thereby avoid various problems with timescales."
"Madam President, I will be brief because I spoke for too long in my first speech."
"I would like to underline that I spoke on behalf of Commissioner Bolkestein who is responsible for these issues."
"I should like to make three points."
"The first is the influence of the European Union in the Basle Committee."
"I mentioned the global framework."
"Nine out of 13 members of the Basle Committee are members of the European Union."
"The Commission and the European Central Bank are involved in its debates."
"We have the opportunity to convey the European Union's points of view in the debates and in the Basle Committee framework."
"Thanks to the coordination of our positions, we influenced the debates in the Basle Committee, in the areas of review of the capital requirements applicable to lending to SMEs and the wider issue of recognition of collateral."
"Those are two examples where our proposals did play a major role in the debates on the Basle Committee."
"Secondly, creating compatibility between flexibility and transparency is a key issue for the credibility of the overall system."
"It will be necessary to establish not only the relationship between the minimum capital requirements of the institution and the risks that such an institution takes on board, but also to guarantee that there will be transparency in the criteria that are used by the supervisory bodies of the Member States."
"That is why the financial services action plan is seeking a certain degree of convergence of the supervision in order to guarantee that flexibility in the application of the system will not detract from the necessary transparency and the outside control of the way each system acts."
"Finally, let me ask you to save your more detailed and technical questions for my colleague, Mr Bolkestein."
"I am sure he will be willing to give you full and comprehensive answers."
"I do not dare to go any further than this because let me remind you that the last Renaissance man was Leibnitz and he died some years ago!"
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"I also wish to thank you for all your good wishes on the occasion of the first Swedish Presidency."
"Vote"
"I voted for the motion, Mr President."
"I agree that we should proceed with the mutual recognition of financial penalties since we do not seem to be able to achieve an agreement to establish a single European penal code or a single European code of criminal procedure."
"However, I would not want this makeshift solution to become a definitive one."
"I feel that Europe must gradually approximate Member States' legislation and only accept mutual recognition where a genuine agreement cannot be achieved."
"I therefore hope that, next time, we will be voting not on the mutual recognition of financial penalties but on a code of procedure for uniform financial penalties throughout Europe."
"Kauppi report (A5-0450/2001)"
"I am, of course, Mr President, very honoured by the Members' consideration, for whenever I start to speak, increasing numbers of Members come from the corridors into the Chamber, as you can see is happening at the moment."
"With regard to this document, I would like to say that sailors and seafarers' chief complaint about their job is that it is not stable and that when they arrive in port - as we all know, after a day ashore they cannot wait to get back on board - they have to wait months and months, sometimes years there."
"In my opinion, there ought to be an agreement for seafarers which stipulates eight or nine or six months on board every year and guarantees this rhythm of work throughout seafarers' working lives."
". (EL) The report acknowledges the dramatic fall in the number of seafarers in the ÅU and the shortage of properly trained men and officers."
"You only have to remember that the number of seafarers in the European Union has fallen from 320 000 in 1978 to 120 000 today to agree that the seafaring manpower of the Member States of the European Union has been totally decimated."
"The report ascribes this state of affairs to secondary causes and avoids tackling the root cause of the problem."
"The cause of this decimation is the European Union's very own maritime policy, which is predicated on the good old competitiveness of the shipping companies' fleets and benefits the shipping industry, with painful consequences for seafarers' families."
"For the sake of this competitiveness, the European Union's common maritime policy has recognised flags of convenience since as early as the mid 1980s, resulting in sweeping changes at the expense of seafarers and obscene profits for big business."
"The shipping industry uses current legislation and the EU's proposals to exploit seafaring labour from third countries and seafarers from within the European Union by paying lower wages and offering lower social benefits, thereby undermining the fundamental rights of workers (collective agreements, 7-hour day, contracts of employment, time off during the year etc.)."
"Falling standards in training and further training, which have wiped out the fund of know-how which used to exist, are the result of the EU's own policy, which has pushed for diplomas to be changed to certificates of ability to exercise the profession of seafarer and for professional diplomas to be abolished."
"The report makes no reference whatsoever to these serious problems; it merely regurgitates the usual wish-lists or, worse, proposes applying the good old sub-standard, fragmented training programmes, which are tailored to the needs of the shipping market, and networking educational institutions and companies."
"Objectively-speaking, this sort of assessment and proposals such as these ally public concerns about the huge social problem of unemployment, accidents at sea (crimes at sea, to use the words of seafarers) and ecological disasters, while concealing the liability of shipowners and their political puppets."
"In our opinion, if seafarers step up their fight at national and international level, if seafarers join forces with seafarers from third countries and overturn these policies under the banner of ""an equal day's pay for an equal day's work"", if seafarers are recruited subject to vested insurance rights, collective agreements and compulsory national insurance and if state education and training for seafarers is brought up to standard (for example by upgrading state-run naval schools), this will go a long way towards resolving the problems of the training and recruitment of seafarers."
"This sort of policy would guarantee that the needs of contemporary seafarers' families are met, as well as guaranteeing safety at sea and environmental protection."
"It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece intend to vote against the report."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 17 January 2002."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to add my name to the attendance register."
"Not only did I vote, I even took the floor during that session; yet I am not included on the list."
"I hope that this can be rectified."
"Yes, indeed, Mr Pronk."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Announcement by the President"
"I should like to inform the House that I received, shortly after my arrival in office, advice from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, inviting the President to submit to the European Court of Justice for review the question of the legal base with regard to the European Company Statute."
"The deadline for implementing that request was today."
"I consulted widely, both inside and outside the House on this issue and had the opportunity to hear opinions of the Conference of Presidents."
"I have made a decision, while respecting the weight of the argument - which is a substantial legal argument - not to make a reference to the European Court of Justice."
"Essentially I have made this decision, prior to the forthcoming convention and having regard to the Laeken Declaration which expressly mentions Articles 95 and 308 - the articles in dispute in this case - so we can make an act of political faith between ourselves and the other institutions as we prepare for that convention."
"I have since spoken to the President of the European Commission and to the President of the Council, Mr Aznar López."
"I am assured in both cases that they understand the political act of faith which has been made."
"I believe that they will want, in the coming weeks, to try to find between our institutions a way to recognise the substance of these issues, which is about our role as a Parliament in representing citizens of the Union and their concerns in the law-making process."
"I hope that in the end this act of political faith in the primacy of politics will be repaid, understood and not misunderstood."
"It is important - this side of the Barcelona Summit, with an issue that has been with us for three decades and perhaps has no parallel in the issues before us - to appreciate that it was not an easy decision to arrive at."
"I hope, in the end - both for those in the House who were inclined to agree with my view last week and for the many who were inclined at that time to disagree - that they will appreciate that the judgment is one made in good faith."
"I believe we can build on it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most of you will be aware that I have taken a different line from our President."
"However, I respect this decision, and if you have succeeded in bringing forth from this result an attitude of goodwill that will later actually be reflected in amendments to the Treaties or in some other acknowledgement of our rights, that would be a success that would not have been possible without the joint action of the Legal Affairs Committee and our President."
"Mr President, I totally agree with your decision."
"I believe that what we are dealing with here is an act of political faith, in view of the fact that we are attempting to defend the existence of the European Company Statute, without prejudice to the fundamental issues arising from the legal base."
"Mr President, as you know, my position was quite the opposite and I am still convinced that it is a mistake not to refer the matter to the Court of Justice."
"I simply wanted to say this in plenary as well, because if we accept that the Council can pass an act under the co-decision procedure, taking away the power of co-decision from Parliament, we are playing into the Council' s hands."
"Unfortunately, I do not think that the Council will look upon this in a positive light, but rather as something that it can do again."
"I just wanted to say, therefore, that I think it is a mistake not to refer the matter to the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate you on your decision not to make a reference to the European Court of Justice, as the creation of the European Company was one of the objectives for this parliamentary session, and is one of the five decisions for which the economy has been waiting."
"For thirty years, this decision has been awaited; for thirty years, negotiations have been in progress."
"To go to the Court of Justice now would mean this business being dragged out for another five or six years; for I am convinced that no firm would avail itself of this important new form under such uncertain conditions."
"So I believe it wise in this case to refrain from making a reference to the European Court of Justice."
"Mr President, on a point of order: it will hardly surprise the House if, on behalf of my Group, I support the position you have taken."
"But I would nonetheless urge you in your intervention at the European Council in Barcelona to make the point very strongly that we as a House are not happy with the procedure that has been taken and that we hope in the future to see a much more constructive and collaborative approach to us from the other institutions."
"Mr President, as you know, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports your decision."
"From a legal point of view, whether or not we have lost influence in the co-decision procedure is debatable."
"My group - as Mr Medina Ortega has already stated - thinks not and that also, from a political point of view, the decision we have taken is the right one."
"As we approach the Barcelona Summit, I would ask you to not only defend our position with regard to the implications of this decision for the European business world, but also, given its importance, from the point of view of consolidating economic democracy and workers' rights."
"Mr President, I had not actually intended to speak, but I do of course have something to say whenever the others have something to say."
"I would like first to say a few words of thanks to you for the way you dealt with this issue."
"As Mr Lehne said, a majority of our group was in favour of legal proceedings, but there were other opinions, such as that of the esteemed Mr Karl von Wogau."
"I liked, however, the way you dealt with the issue politically, telephoning the President-in-Office of the Council, the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, and, of course, keeping in touch with the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi."
"We, of course, have confidence in the Spanish Prime Minister; not only in that role do we trust that he will keep his word and that words will be matched by deeds, but also in his role as President-in-Office of the Council."
"I also have something to say to the Commission. So, Commissioner, please tell the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, that, tomorrow, when we deal with Mr von Wogau's report, with financial services and with everything we associate with 'Lamfalussy' , we expect the Commission to take up a position in defence of Parliament's rights vis-à-vis the Council of Ministers."
"That is what we expect tomorrow."
"If such a statement is not forthcoming, it will have serious consequences for our relations with the Commission, and so, Mr President, your action will no doubt help the President with his statement tomorrow."
"Again, let me extend my express thanks to you for the way you have handled this matter politically."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, as former Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and as it was under my chairmanship that this very issue was debated, I asked if I could be the last to speak on this subject."
"I would like to make it quite clear that, from the very outset, the Committee on Legal Affairs considered this matter to be a legal issue of enormous political significance, since it dealt with Parliament' s prerogatives and the inter-institutional balance."
"Having said this, from the very beginning, the Committee on Legal Affairs was extremely aware that the priority in this case was not to hinder the entry into force of this directive, which had been under discussion for thirty years and, in fact, the decision made by this Committee specifically requests that, in the event of a decision being taken to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the outcome of this would be upheld, even if our decision were overruled."
"In saying this, Mr President, I am expressing my respect and understanding for the fact that the decision that has been taken at this time - which appears to reflect the majority opinion in this House - responds to the concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I would even go further than the comments made by some of my fellow Members."
"In this case, if the European Parliament does not refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, it will be showing a greater degree of political responsibility."
"Because although it is not giving up the defence of its prerogatives, it understands that there is an immediate greater value in postponing the referral of this matter to the Court."
"I believe that the European Council declarations will strengthen our position, and not only the Barcelona Council but also the Intergovernmental Conference, and it is to be hoped that we can put an end to the imbalance in legal bases which has arisen as a result of this situation."
"I thank all those colleagues who have made brief contributions to what is, in effect, a mini-debate on the matter, including those colleagues who disagree with the choice that was made."
"For as long as I have the privilege to lead the House I will always do my very best as regards my own judgment - and with consultation - to represent our interests and the interests of our citizens."
"We talked a great deal in the course of the weeks before we elected a president about making our House more political."
"I hope that this act of political faith will say that we bring primacy of politics to what we do for the next stretch."
"We will see whether that can create a supportive and creative environment between ourselves and the other institutional players in our work for Europe at the forthcoming convention."
"Procedural remarks"
"Mr President, on a point of order: I would like to request the assistance of my colleagues in Parliament, and indeed of the Commission, following the disaster that struck Dublin in particular last week when it was inundated with serious floods, rendering homeless many frightened people, some elderly."
"The scenes in Dublin were more reminiscent of other countries, where there are greater extremes of climate."
"When I returned from Parliament I found my neighbours - I shall declare an interest, I live in that part of the city - were bobbing around in boats, carrying their pets."
"That is something I never expected to see in my country."
"I know some of your constituents, Mr President, suffered the same experience."
"I would like to express my admiration for those who responded to the tragedy but also, if possible, to request some help with re-housing many of those who lost their homes in this tragedy."
"Mr President, I just want to say how much I appreciate the fact that this matter has been raised."
"It affects both Mrs Banotti's constituency and my own, and I want to be associated with her remarks."
"She lives in that area, which my son represents in the City Council."
"I have to say that the response, not only from the government, but also from the people, was heroic."
"On this question I will communicate with the relevant Irish authorities and will raise the matter with the European Commission."
"Mr President, the President of the United States and other senior officials recently announced that they intend to continue and extend their attacks on other countries on the pretext of combating terrorism or preventing these countries from developing weapons of mass destruction."
"Mr Bush talks of an axis of evil between Iran, Iraq and North Korea and has said that he is keeping open all his options for making the USA and its allies safe."
"Other senior officials have spoken along the same lines, causing a great deal of concern..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Korakas, on the issue of substance which you raise we have a debate tomorrow afternoon with Mr Solana."
"It seems to me that the perfectly intelligent point you wish to make should be made during that debate."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the European Parliament to oppose this policy and to put a stop, at long last, to situations which put us in danger of another world war."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the seriousness of the situation around Calais following the second refusal by French courts last Friday to close the Sangatte refugee transit centre."
"In particular, I want to highlight the damage being done to the British rail freight industry by the policy of the French authorities effectively to close the tunnel to freight trains for 18 hours a day."
"Eight thousand British jobs are being put at risk as a result of this state of affairs, including in my own area of the east of England."
"Apart from the other very serious implications, the situation makes a mockery of the idea of the free movement of goods across the European Union."
"I hope the Commission will institute urgent proceedings against the French authorities in order to rectify this situation."
"On Thursday there will be a joint debate which will include a reference to this matter."
"Those colleagues who are interested should take note of that debate."
"Mr President, I am speaking in my capacity as MEP for northern France, following Mr Van Orden, whose comments regarding the Sangatte Centre rather surprised me."
"What surprised me, first and foremost, is that he is questioning a court ruling."
"I did not think that it was customary in the United Kingdom for a political assembly to criticise a decision taken by the courts."
"What also surprised me is that he is not concerned about the reasons why so many refugees try to enter Great Britain."
"Lastly, I would like to point out to him, as I know the centre well having visited it many times, that the intention is to humanely manage a situation which, in itself, is not humane and which has arisen due to a lack of harmonised rules on non-European citizens entering and circulating within the European Union."
"Rather than criticising a decision of a court or a country, I would hope that we will all do what is necessary so that common rules can, at long last, be established in the European Union."
"Let me remind colleagues again that, whatever their point of view on this matter, it is on the agenda for Thursday and that is the appropriate place to debate it."
"Mr President, the nineteenth Winter Olympics start in Salt Lake City in the USA on Friday 8 February."
"As you know, the aim of the Olympic Games is to promote world peace, friendship, understanding, solidarity, dialogue and the peaceful coexistence of nations and cultures through the common endeavour of athletes from all over the world."
"This is the spirit in which the Olympic truce, the fundamental principle behind the Olympic Games, was born in the eighth century."
"Weapons were laid down and all hostilities ceased while the Games were on."
"As the idea of this truce, of global conciliation, echoes ideas and values repeatedly proclaimed in this Chamber, I should like to ask you to write to the President of the Olympic Committee, Mr Rogge, and to the Secretary-General of the UN, Mr Kofi Annan, confirming that the European Parliament supports the idea of a truce and calling on everyone involved in armed conflict to lay down their weapons and use the coming weeks, while the Olympic Games are under way, to resolve their differences peaceably."
"We shall communicate that as you request."
"Mr President, I should like to know whether you share my concern at the mawkish exhibition held in Parliament's building in Brussels last week entitled ""We on death row""."
"This exhibition set out to glamorise convicted felons who have committed heinous crimes."
"Surely our constituents would prefer us to save our sympathy for the victims of these crimes and for the families of the victims who are condemned to a life sentence of grief?"
"Colleagues may also like to recall that public opinion in a number of Member States is still resolutely supportive of the death penalty."
"Can we please avoid such distasteful displays in the future, or at least see that the interests of victims and their families are given due respect?"
"Mr Helmer, I should like to point out to you that the Treaty of Amsterdam includes among its terms a prohibition on the use of the death penalty."
"This applies not only in Member States ..."
"... but also is a requirement for entry for candidate states."
"At the risk of creating further offence to you, I have to admit that I attended the opening of the exhibition and was proud to do so."
"Mr President, as Quaestor in charge of exhibitions, I sometimes have to refuse exhibitions but, given the proud history of this Parliament in relation to the death sentence, I was proud to authorise that exhibition."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to consider writing a letter to the President of Nigeria offering the condolences of the Members of this House on the horrendous explosions that took place in Lagos."
"Over 1 000 people were killed and there are now over 4 000 orphans there."
"I am sure everyone in this House would wish them to know our feelings."
"Mr Corrie, I shall be pleased to do so."
"Drug trafficking"
"Mr President, I shall try to make myself understood, despite the noise."
"The present report deals with a Commission proposal with a view to the adoption of a Council framework decision."
"It aims to help create an area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for by the Treaties, particularly since Amsterdam, and for which, subsequently too, a programme had been expressly scheduled during summit meetings."
"However, the proposal in question is not terribly far-reaching."
"More specifically, it is about the common fight against cross-border crime, particularly in terms of making arrangements regarding minimum maximum penalties to be included in the legislation of the Member States."
"In fact, the entire document has been written in such a way as to maximise its chances of being adopted by the Council, which means that it merely codifies the lowest common denominator emerging from what is to be included in the legislation of the Member States."
"As such, it has, in fact, become a fairly modest document which we in the Committee thought required some more reinforcement in places. The reinforcement should be sufficiently constructive to ensure that the improvements remain within the realms of what is possible."
"We have therefore not held an explicit debate on drugs policy."
"Neither in the framework decision, nor in the proposal did we want to include a decision on whether certain drugs should be legalised or not, and neither did we want to draw a distinction between certain soft and hard drugs."
"These issues are all far too ambitious."
"Our goal is, in fact, far more modest."
"I therefore hope that, during the vote, we will reject the amendments which do implicitly deal with these issues, so that we can present to the Council a viable proposal which is in line with the opinions that are, democratically speaking, held by the majority of the European population."
"We have tried - and we have, in my opinion, reached consensus about this in the Committee - to tighten up the proposal in terms of penalties, for example by not seeking to replace custodial sentences by alternative penalties where serious offenders are concerned."
"For them, spending twenty-four hours helping out in an old people' s home does not really constitute a suitable, alternative punitive measure."
"Furthermore, we have already suggested that the Commission and the Council should perhaps consider the options of civil law penalties which particularly affect offenders in terms of what is most dear to them, namely their possessions."
"Thirdly, we agree that we would prefer not to develop a shadow bureaucracy under the authority of the Council' s Secretary-General."
"If the Treaty of Amsterdam already mentions a transfer of elements from the third pillar to the first pillar, this must be implemented, and we should refrain from leaping forward to an entirely different policy by instituting a shadow bureaucracy under the Secretary-General."
"Even within the Dutch political spectrum, I am not one of the extremists, but rather a moderate, on this score."
"I am therefore of the opinion that this legal approach with regard to penalties etc. forms a kind of tailpiece and is not the most important component of our drugs policy as a whole."
"What matters most are the preventive and therapeutic measures, and the policy developed in these sectors."
"However, we should not neglect the legal approach because, to a large extent, it has a lot to do with keeping the peace."
"This is therefore very much a tailpiece that should have its place."
"For the rest, and on behalf of all of us, I believe that Community cooperation should be imposed in a more stringent manner at times, whilst maintaining respect for the national courts' own boundaries, maybe even somewhat more respect than has already been shown in the Commission proposal."
"I would now like to turn to the amendments."
"Following the vote, thirteen amendments have been tabled in the Committee, something which I am not terribly happy about."
"Or rather, I would like to advise against nearly all of them."
"In Amendment No 37, the idea that we will not focus on the prosecution of addicts is broadened to also include users."
"In my view, it is not for the report to comment on this but, rather, up to the Member States to decide on the policy they generally wish to enforce, or resume enforcing, where users are concerned."
"In any case, it is clear that our position in terms of not wishing to prosecute addicts is based on our preference for a therapeutic emphasis in our policy."
"Furthermore, I have noticed that the words 'large-scale' , 'international' , 'cross-border' and 'organised' appear liberally in these thirteen other amendments."
"This is rather forced in my opinion."
"They are already used a few times in the text itself, and it seems as if the people who tabled these amendments are, in fact, on a mission to restrict the scope of the proposal."
"The text even states that action is to be taken specifically if the trade is from one EU country to another EU country."
"Adding the words I have just mentioned seems downright ridiculous."
"For what arrives directly from Columbia, Surinam and the Dutch Antilles would not fall within the scope of this framework decision."
"I would really advise against adopting these amendments in the strongest terms."
"Incitement and complicity too are exempted from the scope of this proposal in one of the amendments."
"I would say that there are some that are more liberal in their inclinations than the rapporteur."
"Since he himself is not one of the strictest people, I would therefore, in fact, like to reject all amendments which I consider to be unduly liberal."
"Mr President, since this is the first opportunity I have had to speak since your election, I should like to wish you the greatest happiness in your Presidency of the European Parliament."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Oostlander on the quality of this report, into which he has put a great deal of hard work, and to which the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats gives its unreserved support."
"The issue of drugs is a central concern of Europe' s citizens. For years, the European Parliament has demonstrated its commitment to the fight against drugs."
"And today, the European dimension of this fight is clear to see in actions that range from the adoption of legal instruments to combat the manufacture of drugs, the trafficking of drugs and money-laundering to cooperation with producer countries and promoting the prevention of drug addiction and the fight against it, involving treatment, rehabilitation and even the development of information and coordination networks between Member States."
"We should bear in mind that, since the end of the 'cold war' , there has been an unprecedented increase in drug trafficking as a source of funding for the activities of criminal and terrorist organisations."
"It is currently estimated that drug-related crime and drug trafficking itself could represent approximately eight per cent of world trade."
"Putting an end to this trafficking would, therefore, mean shutting down the largest sources of funding for these criminal and terrorist organisations."
"This proposal for a framework decision, however, as Mr Oostlander quite rightly pointed out, proposes nothing new and nor does it strengthen the mechanisms for combating international drug trafficking."
"The proposal is a necessary step, and we know that it is intended to respond to the needs identified both in the Vienna action plan and in the Tampere conclusions, as well as in the European Union 2000-2004 Drugs Strategy."
"This is, indeed, a necessary step, but an inadequate one: it is limited to establishing the lowest common denominator of the national provisions in force in each Member State for offences in the field of drug trafficking."
"Consequently the Member States must adopt the necessary measures to ensure that these offences are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties, including custodial sentences with a maximum term of imprisonment of no less than five years in serious cases."
"Now, in my opinion, this is a very low limit, especially given that the legislation in force in the Member States already imposes heavy penalties for drug trafficking, in particular when the scale and the seriousness of the case can be considered to be aggravating circumstances."
"For example, in my country, Portugal, this limit is twelve years, and can be increased by one-third."
"Lastly, I wish to mention an aspect which is of the greatest importance, and that is the confiscation of all illicit proceeds acquired directly or indirectly from the crime of trafficking or from being a member of a criminal organisation or of a plot to traffic drugs."
"I feel that this will satisfy the wishes of many of the organisations that have made a remarkable effort in the fight against drugs, that some of the proceeds obtained through the confiscation of these goods can be put to use in the policy of prevention."
"Mr President, drugs policy has often led to heated debates in the European Parliament."
"Elaborate expositions used to turn everything upside down and used to touch on family, belief and authority."
"Today, the waters are somewhat calmer."
"Since the European Commission proposal is confined to the legal aspects, level-headedness is what is called for."
"As the Commission rightly underlines in its proposal, the responsibility for combating illegal drug trafficking lies first and foremost with the Member States."
"However, since it is often a case of organised trafficking which encompasses various countries, a framework decision which tackles this cross-border trafficking can be a useful addition to national policy."
"However, what is missing from the proposal submitted by the Commission is a differentiation between the different kinds of drugs and, consequently, a differentiated penalisation of illegal drug trafficking."
"An increasing number of countries in Europe distinguish soft and hard drugs on the basis of the health risks to which they give rise, and there is also increasingly more political support for a policy based on straightforward information campaigns and on the prevention of health risks."
"On this basis, a few Member States are adopting a tolerant policy with regard to soft drugs."
"It is not the intention that the present framework decision should scrap this policy."
"As far as penalisation is concerned, all kinds of factors need to be taken into consideration in order to establish effective and proportionate punishment."
"Unfortunately, the criteria for determining the seriousness of the crime, such as the extent of trafficking and the nature and availability of the products involved, have not been included in the proposal."
"This is why my group, together with three other groups, has tabled an amendment in order to have such criteria included."
"Cultural differences and the different prosecution policies of the Member States, combined with the principle of subsidiarity, provide good reason for restricting this proposal to organised and cross-border illegal drug trafficking."
"Only with this restriction does the large majority of my group deem that this framework decision represents added value."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have to admit that I am speaking on behalf of a significant minority within our group."
"The drugs situation in Europe is becoming worse and worse."
"The fact that our borders are becoming ever more open is basically something to be welcomed, of course, but the downside of this is that smuggling, including drug smuggling, is on the increase."
"I am concerned that it looks as if more and more countries are abandoning clear and explicit restrictive attitudes to drug abuse."
"Our objective must be nothing other than a drugs-free Europe."
"Giving up that objective would be tantamount to leaving thousands of young people in the lurch."
"Mr President, I am well aware of Mr Oostlander' s problems in arriving at a balanced view."
"In general, I think he has succeeded."
"I welcome the more restrictive tone he has adopted here today, but there are wordings I do not agree with."
"What is absolutely clear is that the amendments are along completely the wrong lines."
"To embrace a permissive attitude towards so-called soft drugs would be devastating."
"We know that these are the gateway to heavy drug abuse."
"We Swedish Liberals, and a large proportion of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in general, will vote against all attempts to relax the strict and clear policy on drugs."
"We reject Amendments Nos 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35 and 37."
"We are able to accept Amendments Nos 32 and 36."
"Mr President, the rapporteur asked us a moment ago to refrain from making any references to the legalisation or otherwise of drugs or to whether or not a policy of tolerance is to be adopted, because this is not what is at issue here."
"However, I am not so certain."
"To me, illegal drug trafficking is simply too broad a term."
"Mr Oostlander is opposed to the Dutch practice of tolerance, and that is fine."
"I am myself of the opinion that it is only a half-baked compromise."
"I would prefer to see soft drugs legalised, which are, after all, less harmful than the alcohol which flows abundantly in this establishment too."
"It is not only in the Netherlands that soft drugs are tolerated."
"For reasons of public health, this policy is also being replicated in other countries at local, regional and sometimes even national level."
"We may be making bold statements now, but matters will prove different in practice."
"Let us therefore confine our efforts to a policy which we can implement, which is also a European task according to the principle of subsidiarity and on which there is broad parliamentary and social consensus, namely a policy to tackle lucrative, organised, cross-border drug trafficking."
"Mr Oostlander is entitled to thrash out the rest at national level. After all, the elections are in the offing."
"Mr President, with acute drug-related deaths standing at 7,000 to 8,000 a year, my Group will be supporting very strongly the report by Mr Oostlander and the fight against illicit drug trafficking."
"We can be assured that any report by Mr Oostlander is backed by a great sense of purpose and integrity."
"I have known him for a long time and I am absolutely certain that he means what he says in this particular report."
"With 3,000 miles of coastline around Ireland, the possibility of illicit drug smuggling is always present."
"Cooperation at European level is therefore not only to be welcomed but is also essential."
"I look forward to more concrete proposals at EU level as to how the EU can further help us keep drugs not only out of Ireland but also out of the rest of Europe."
"What sort of a message do Members want to send from this Parliament?"
"Drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are okay?"
"I do not accept that."
"The decision has to be up to the Members of this House."
"But the choice is clear: either you support Mr Oostlander or you send out the dangerous message that heroin and synthetic drugs for personal use and distribution are acceptable."
"Amendment No 28 by the PSE Group, the Verts/ALE Group and the GUE/NGL Group and others cannot be misinterpreted: ""... users who produce, acquire and/or possess drugs for personal use and users who supply drugs to others without the intention of making a profit are excluded from the scope of this framework decision."""
"Therefore, it is all right to supply heroin to children or to adults, as long as you do not want to make a profit from it."
"Who in fact makes the profit?"
"It is the great drug barons whom we seem to tolerate."
"We seem to be able to pursue the terrorists responsible for the horrific events of 11 September, but it seems to be beyond us to tackle international drug terrorists."
"We must know who they are."
"In fact the murder of the journalist Veronica Guerin in my country galvanised politicians and police into action which smashed a savage gangster culture in Ireland."
"Unfortunately, those gangsters have been replaced by other younger and even more vicious criminals."
"During the past week, on business in the inner city in my constituency, I witnessed whole complexes riven by drugs."
"They must be tackled."
"The people who are producing this cocaine and heroin, and causing such havoc in our cities and towns and the countryside, must be stopped."
"Mr Oostlander's report is a small but very important step in that direction."
"This report has all the integrity that is expected of this Parliament."
"I thank him for his efforts in this respect."
"Mr President, Mr Oostlander notes with regret that this Commission proposal does not amount to much."
"It merely codifies the lowest common denominator to emerge from the legislation in the Member States."
"In all honesty, I happen to be pleased with this cautious approach by the Commission."
"Criminal law is an area which is strongly influenced by national culture and history."
"In my view, restraint is still essential when competences are transferred to European level."
"Only where clear-cut, cross-border issues arise can European legislation offer added value."
"This opinion seems to be shared by few in Parliament."
"Imagine my surprise when, this time, I was overtaken on the right by my fellow MEPs from the socialist and green groups."
"With their amendments, they set great store by the concepts of the subsidiarity principle, cultural differences and national legislation, while the issue in question, namely illegal drug trafficking, is clearly a cross-border problem which requires European legislation."
"My fellow MEPs want to add the words 'cross-border' and 'organised' to the definition."
"To me, these concepts appear to be inherent to drug trafficking and need not be added."
"At best, they will complicate implementation of the decision."
"Finally, the rapporteur struggled with this simple codification of the lowest common denominator to emerge from Member States' legislation."
"Those who tabled the amendments seem to be wrestling with the lowest common denominator itself."
"This does demonstrate that the subsidiarity principle is nothing more than an argument that is dusted down for the occasion in order to protect a Dutch drugs policy that is out of step internationally."
"I support the proposal which makes a responsible start on combating illegal drug trafficking, a cross-border problem which directly affects the security of European citizens."
"In my view, the fact that the Netherlands can get into difficulty because legislation there is not applied as it should be seems to be a result of inconsistent policy. Policy needs to be aligned to European and international legislation, and not the other way round."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Saturday evening, in Italy, Alessandro Macioci, a young, eighteen-year-old man died."
"He committed suicide by inhaling the exhaust fumes of his car, because he had been accused, Mr Oostlander, of drug trafficking after the police found 2.5g of hashish on his person."
"These are the facts, Mr Oostlander, this is not something out of a novel."
"This is the way in which the police forces of various European Union Member States are interpreting the policy that you are proposing to us to combat serious crime and this is the way that the harmonisation that you are proposing is interpreted."
"Against all logic, this harmonisation is interfering in the affairs of the Member States of the European Union; it boils down to absurd policies - in a country such as France, for example - and restrictions for the States which are finally beginning to understand."
"I am thinking here of the State to which you belong, namely the Netherlands, where you have not approved the policy, but I now also have in mind Belgium, Portugal and Spain, where Members of the Partido Popular Español are conducting some very worthwhile experiments in Madrid into risk reduction."
"This is a policy that we obviously cannot harmonise."
"What we must harmonise is always the worst - it is a very libertine approach to law, Mr Oostlander, because you are proposing laws which cannot be applied."
"The Liberals and the 'libertarians' want laws that can be applied; but you adopt a libertine approach to the law."
"And for 30 years, your policy has, day in, day out, produced laws that have never been applied."
"Your policy is also destroying entire countries, such as Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Laos and Burma."
"These countries are literally being destroyed by your prohibitionist drugs policy."
"I think that, in addition to the many friendly pats on the back that I get from numerous fellow Members, even from the centre right, Mr Oostlander, these Members realise that this prohibitionist policy is a criminal policy that encourages crime; they realise that we must adopt a very different approach."
"Even if you try to limit the scope of your report, as you tried to do in your opening remarks, it is going in completely the opposite direction."
"The Commission should not be getting involved in this."
"The Commission was not capable of saying no to Mr Arlacchi and to his criminal form of management that lasted five years, which consisted of recycled KGB officers and Russian generals who were involved in drug trafficking."
"We all know this - these are the facts that we read every day in the newspapers."
"Let the Commission deal with things that it knows how to deal with!"
"The Commission should take a look at the UNDCP reports, but should stop bothering us with absolutely absurd proposals such as this."
"I think that it is high time that Parliament had the courage to be slightly less hypocritical, and for it to do what our fellow Members Chris Davies and Marco Cappato recently did in Great Britain; as MEPs, we must finally demonstrate the absurdity of these laws."
"Mr President, as one of the previous speakers said, the Commission proposal laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking is a tiny, timid step towards resolving the massive problem of the illicit trade in psychotropic substances."
"Unfortunately, the main proposal, on penalties, is geared to an upper limit of no less than five years, meaning that judges are free to decide between no penalty at all and several years."
"This, of course, does little for harmonisation because almost all national laws allow for severer penalties."
"However, I should point out that with the proposed amendments, most of which I trust will be adopted, we have managed to extract some secondary benefit from this decision."
"First, they state quite clearly that addicts should be treated as patients rather than criminals and that drug abuse should not be a criminal offence."
"Secondly, it is proposed that revenue from property confiscated from drug barons should be used for prevention and therapy programmes."
"Finally, I hope that future Commission proposals will be more ambitious and will set clear, harmonised minimum rather than maximum limits on penalties for the worst drug traffickers so that we can secure an area of security and justice within the European Union."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to congratulate Mr Oostlander on the fact that he has made a number of valuable suggestions to improve the Commission proposal: firstly, strengthening the mechanisms for confiscating the profits of criminals who traffic in drugs."
"If we hit these people where it really hurts, namely in their wallets, this will be far more effective than stiff custodial sentences."
"Neither should we focus on the prosecution of addicts, but rather pour all our energy into prevention."
"This is a sound message which, with limited resources, Europe must take as a guiding principle."
"However, this is where our paths diverge."
"I am delighted that, following a European trend to adopt a more realistic drugs policy, a majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will be supporting all the amendments aimed at distinguishing between hard drugs and soft drugs and at the non-prosecution of users, as well as the amendments which will restrict this proposal to cross-border, criminal drug trafficking."
"Let us concentrate our limited resources on the big criminals rather than the small users."
"I, for my part, should like to warn fellow MEPs from the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats against engaging in token politics when they talk of dangerous signals which Parliament would in this way be sending out."
"In the final analysis, we do not yet have any say in this area."
"My group also places question marks alongside two specific Commission proposals."
"It would be unwise not simply to limit the minimum maximum penalty of five years to certain crimes but to arrange for it to be applied to all drugs-related crimes."
"We will accordingly be backing the amendment for a restriction."
"Finally, in our view, the arrangement through which informers would receive a penalty reduction in exchange for information about drugs gangs is going too far."
"This is a very sensitive matter in which different Member States uphold different traditions."
"To make an arrangement in this way, so suddenly, would be taking things too far in our view."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Oostlander, on the excellent report that he has tabled, and state that this framework decision submitted by the Commission is part of a global strategy to combat drugs based on a balanced approach of measures to reduce supply and demand and to act against illicit trafficking."
"This proposal is not the entire European policy on drugs: this proposal deals with only one specific component, which is the fight against drug trafficking."
"But our approach to the issue of drugs in the European Union is part of the Action Plan for 2000-2004, which will be assessed at its halfway point, some time this year."
"In Laeken, the Heads of State and Government asked us to approve the framework decision on the harmonisation of penalties at European level for drug trafficking by the end of May of this year."
"That is the sole purpose of this proposal."
"The Commission is of the view that, in the fight against drug trafficking, there must be close cooperation between the various judicial, police and customs authorities of the Member States to deal with the challenge of transnational drug trafficking."
"If such cooperation is going to be effective, it must be underpinned by a common approach at Union level, specifically in the approximation of definitions of the charges and penalties that apply to trafficking, which must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive."
"We welcome the objectives set out in Mr Oostlander' s report."
"Measures to clamp down on traffickers must clearly be supplemented and backed with a policy of prevention and the social rehabilitation of drug addicts."
"The instrument that is envisaged is only intended to cover the penal aspects of the drugs phenomenon."
"The Commission worked on this criminal law initiative, you might say, in full awareness of the facts, for we had carried out major preparatory work, in particular studying the definitions in each Member State, the penalties that can be applied under the law and - of no less importance - the specific ways in which penalties for drug trafficking are applied in each of the 15 Member States."
"This study, which was made public, consequently enabled us to make a comparative analysis of the legislation of all the Member States in the field of drug trafficking."
"Hence the first important point to make is that our objective is to harmonise penalties for drug trafficking."
"This proposal should not be considered to be limited to transnational or cross-border trafficking because the two issues amount to the same thing: in most drugs cases, the trafficking starts outside Europe and is, therefore, always transnational."
"I therefore fail to see how we can envisage punishing cross-border trafficking more severely than the serious trafficking we are seeing within every Member State."
"The States cannot have two penal codes, one to be applied to drug trafficking that takes place exclusively within their borders and another for drug trafficking that has a cross-border dimension."
"Let us move on to the second issue: the definition of drug trafficking."
"The Commission has already been criticised for lacking ambition where this matter is concerned."
"What have we done wrong?"
"We have limited ourselves to taking up the key elements of the United Nations' 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances, and we have combined this definition with national provisions on the definition of offences related to drug trafficking. We have, therefore, simply attempted to produce a synthesis of definitions of drug trafficking."
"However, here - and this is my third important observation - we have respected the principle of subsidiarity."
"This is why the individual consumption of drugs is not included in this definition and nor is the not-for-profit sale of drugs for personal consumption."
"These are left to the exclusive jurisdiction of each Member State, because, as this debate has demonstrated, in this field the solutions put forward by the fifteen Member States differ widely."
"The Commission' s proposal will not, therefore, change these differences in national legislation in the areas in which drug trafficking for the purposes of personal consumption is considered not to incur punishment."
"But when the trafficking is of such a scale and seriousness that it has to incur penalties, the Commission proposes that these should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive."
"The minimum penalty of a maximum sentence of five years is a sanction which provides not only considerable room for manoeuvre for judges to apply the law according to the circumstances of each case of trafficking, but it is also a proposal that seeks to convey an idea of the harshness with which we wish to punish the cases of drug trafficking to which this penalty applies."
"I know that in some countries - and Mr Coelho mentioned the case of Portugal - the minimum penalty of the maximum sentence is heavier than this."
"I must say that in other countries, the penalty is lighter, and we feel that this sentence of five years represents a minimum standard for harmonisation, giving, of course, each Member State the option of establishing other, harsher standards in its legislation for the minimum maximum penalty than can be applied."
"However, this is an issue that is being discussed at Council level."
"I feel, therefore, that this proposal, which I hope Parliament will approve, is an initial step in a fight in which all Member States participate against drug trafficking, which threatens the health, the security and the quality of life of our citizens, and which, as Mr Oostlander has pointed out, is one of the sources of funding for countless other criminal activities, including terrorism itself."
"In this context, I hope that Parliament will support the report and will enable the Council to adopt this framework decision by the end of May this year."
"Third-country nationals"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"Report (A5-0436/2001) by Baroness Ludford on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(2001) 127 - C5-0250/2001 - 2001/0074(CNS)) concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents;"
"Report (A5-0455/2001) by Mrs Kessler on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(2001) 388 - C5-0350/2001 - 2001/0155(CNS)) on the conditions in which third-country nationals shall have the freedom to travel in the territory of the Member States for periods not exceeding three months, introducing a specific travel authorisation and determining the conditions of entry and movement for periods not exceeding six months."
"Mr President, this proposal implements one of the most important commitments of the October 1999 Tampere Summit on justice and home affairs."
"This called for the legal status of long-term legally resident third-country nationals to be approximated to that of Member State nationals, so that they have a set of uniform rights as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens."
"Thus its objective is that immigrants or refugees who have been legally resident for at least five years should be given EU long-term residence status."
"This proposal self-evidently does not cover people who are illegally present in the European Union."
"Nor does it apply to persons who are temporarily resident, such as students or those granted temporary protection."
"In view of the hesitations in some quarters, not least in some parts of the Council, it is important to stress that the EU is merely drawing out the logic of Member States having given some immigrants a legal right to stay long term."
"It is only adding an EU dimension."
"This EU dimension consists of social and legal justice inspired by the fundamental provisions of the EU Treaties, and hard-headed self-interest for the European economy and society."
"There are estimated to be up to 20 million people living legally in the European Union who have not taken, or who have not been permitted to take, citizenship of the Member State in which they live."
"One thinks of Turkish citizens in Germany, North Africans in France as two major communities."
"But there are eligible communities of a myriad of nationalities in all Member States."
"In my own, the United Kingdom, the Economist last week estimated that half of the 2 million Muslims living there are foreign nationals."
"Most of these would have been Commonwealth immigrants arriving in the 1950s and 1960s."
"I will return to the UK position later."
"My wish to be rapporteur for this report stems partly from my commitment to combating racism."
"The fair treatment and active integration of third-country nationals, accompanied by measures to prevent discrimination, will assist in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"This becomes all the time more, not less, important."
"It is strongly in the social and economic interests of the EU to integrate such people, and hypocritical, in the light of other EU policies, for us not to do so."
"There is great concern about the alienation of some immigrant communities and their social and economic disadvantage."
"There are also worrying reports of increased incidents of racially motivated harassment and hostility, especially since 11 September."
"The best means to counter all these factors is to ensure that the immense contribution of immigrants is facilitated, recognised and insisted upon."
"Rights equal to those of EU citizens in areas such as employment, education and social protection will enhance their economic contribution."
"Other measures would in addition enhance social integration."
"I draw attention to Amendments Nos 33 to 35, which I authored, on equal access to legal proceedings, participation in local life and voting rights, but I should immediately state that the new ELDR Amendment No 56 is intended to replace Amendment No 34, in order to clarify that it means participation in local community life, for instance in neighbourhood forums, and that Amendment No 35 is only aspirational in encouraging Member States to give local and European voting rights."
"The Green Group has re-tabled several of my original amendments that got voted down in committee."
"To be consistent, the ELDR will vote for them."
"Let me come to the delicate task of trying to get a balance in the vote on amendments so that all parts of this House can support this report."
"I should like to appeal to the Right to accept that a reasonable outcome would consist in taking some of their points, but not all of them."
"Thus a reference to the Council anti-terrorism measures in assessing threats to security is acceptable, but some of those go too far."
"In practical terms Amendment No 82 is acceptable, but not Amendment No 9."
"While it is acceptable to mention acquisition of knowledge of the host language as being fundamental to social integration, it goes too far to insist that this is a criterion for granting of EC residence status."
"I appeal to the Left not to let objections on points of detail obscure the big picture, so that we fulfil Parliament's long-held commitment to legal rights for third-country nationals."
"It is regrettable that the UK is opting out of this measure."
"Not only will this be socially unjust to UK residents, but it will also make the UK less attractive to talented professionals, a point made by business interests."
"I urge Parliament to rally to a consensus on this balanced and reasonable proposal."
"I also urge the Spanish Presidency to reach agreement in the Council as a demonstration of the seriousness of its commitment to social integration, and also to labour mobility, as will be called for again in the Barcelona Summit."
"We have 20 million residents who, by definition, are mobile."
"It would be hypocritical of us to deny them the right to move around the European Union."
"Mr President, common regulation of the conditions under which third-country nationals shall have the freedom to travel in the territory of the Member States, is much to be welcomed."
"During the Committee's deliberations, the fragmentary attempts at regulation, based on French and Portuguese initiatives, were repeatedly subjected to criticism."
"There was a demand for a more global approach to mobility in the Schengen area, a demand which has been met by this Commission proposal for a directive."
"On the one hand, the conditions under which third-country nationals have the freedom to travel for a maximum of three months are to be regulated and harmonised, thus complying with the obligation laid on the Council by the Treaty of Amsterdam to lay down these conditions within five years of the Treaty entering into force."
"On the other hand, a quite new instrument - that of the specific travel authorisation - is to be introduced, permitting the extension of freedom to travel to six months under certain special conditions."
"Let me say at the outset that I do not understand why a directive was chosen in preference to a regulation as the legal instrument in this instance."
"The text is framed in sufficiently definite terms."
"Since a directive needs to be transposed at national level, the application of the instrument is delayed for an unspecified period of time."
"This instrument, moreover, replaces, among others, Regulation 1091/2001, which has already entered into force. This, then, is another reason why a regulation would be the more appropriate legal instrument."
"There has been no essential change to the freedom to travel enjoyed by third-country nationals who are not required to have a visa and by holders of a longer-term residence permit."
"There is, though, a new regulation for those holders of the national visa issued by the Member States for longer-term residence who are not yet in possession of the residence permit."
"Contrary to the Commission's proposal, such third-country nationals should, in my judgment, continue to be permitted to travel on Member States' territory even before they apply for the residence permit."
"It would represent a retrograde step back to the legal situation under the Schengen Convention if freedom to travel were to be granted only once that application were made, and would be comprehensible to none of the parties affected."
"Moreover, there is no evident reason why this category of persons should be treated differently to, and worse than, other third-country nationals covered by the directive when it comes to the date on which their freedom to travel begins."
"Third-country nationals travelling with a national visa would, in any case, then have to fulfil the same conditions as those travelling with a standard Schengen visa."
"This is a result of putting the visas on an equal footing as regards unrestricted travel."
"It means that the consultation procedures between the Member States on the confidential lists 5A and 5B in the Consular Instructions must also apply to national visas."
"Those Member States with reservations about nationals of certain third countries would otherwise have no possibility of taking cognisance of them and monitoring them if national visas were issued by other Member States, resulting in a security loophole that the events of 11 September have made quite unacceptable."
"Although there was lively discussion on this point in Committee, an overwhelming majority of its members supported my proposal."
"This result confirms the Committee's strength, which lies in its ability to reach, in response to changed conditions, a new decision on a matter on which there has already been a vote."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like once again to congratulate the Commission on having presented us with a raft of proposals intended to facilitate the adaptation of the European Union to the realities of the new European society."
"Europe, once a continent of emigrants, has now become a continent of immigrants. The proposals put forward by the Commission aim to facilitate the integration of these immigrant populations into our respective societies."
"In the debate that took place in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on this issue, several amendments were tabled: some were serious, others less so."
"In the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the committee responsible, Baroness Ludford made a sterling effort to attempt to refine and perfect the legal concepts, but I am left with the impression that, just because of the odd majority, the text of the directive would be ruined if we were to adopt most of the amendments approved by this Committee."
"Baroness Ludford, herself, has tabled some proposals in this regard, which appear to us to be correct, and I believe that, in short, the most important thing that this House could do now is to try to steer the text of the Commission proposal back to a form more along those lines."
"In short, this means achieving the highest degree of equality and comparable conditions between long-term residents from third countries and Community citizens, whilst respecting, naturally, national laws and their constitutional principles, without establishing artificial requirements that would hinder the integration of these people who have already been living in our countries for a long time."
"To sum up, I believe that what we can hope to achieve as a result of the final proposals presented to us by Baroness Ludford and the debate that took place in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is that, as far as possible, the House should change the text back to the original Commission proposal and reject many of the amendments that have been adopted, as I have already said, by a chance majority in the Committee on Citizens' Rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank not only the Commission and you, Commissioner Vitorino, for the even-handed presentation on long-term residence by third-country nationals, but also Baroness Ludford, the rapporteur, for the close cooperation."
"What is important to me is the amendments to this directive making it possible for the Member States to carry out security checks."
"Not only the host country, but the whole European Union, benefits from this, as Schengen makes it possible to cross the internal frontiers at any time, and so the other Member States must be able to rely on the first host country to receive third-country nationals in a responsible manner."
"Checks of this kind take account of the security needs of the host population, and also the needs of the third-country nationals living in our Member States."
"They are, on the one hand, protected against acts of terrorism, whilst, on the other hand, the state in question is making it clear that the third-country nationals living among us do not represent any danger to internal security."
"By this means we can give a clear rebuff to those forces that are endeavouring to make xenophobic capital out of acts of terrorism."
"Something that is also important is the possibility of making integration a criterion for the grant of a residence permit."
"As a rule, third-country nationals with long-term rights of abode want to be naturalised, to become part of society, and to be able to make themselves understood."
"For communication leads to understanding, and those who understand each other grow closer together."
"We must, then, put down markers."
"We must require language learning and promote it, for deficient knowledge of the language means a lack of communication and virtually inevitable exclusion from many areas of life."
"If our immigrants are not to remain set apart from society, we must promote language learning, or else the new citizen is on a foreordained path to low-paid work."
"To require it is primarily to give an opportunity and not to set up an obstacle; no doubt we all agree that we want to give a fair chance to the people who come to make their home among us."
"Mr President, at the Tampere Summit, the European Council declared that the legal status of third-country nationals should be approximated to that of Member State nationals so that they have a uniform set of rights as close as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens."
"The Commission' s proposal set out, in a very clear and balanced fashion, the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to acquire long-term resident status."
"This is a balanced proposal."
"The criteria are, amongst others, the length of legal residence and adequate resources."
"Furthermore, the individual must not constitute a threat to public order or domestic security."
"I must say, however, that some amendments cause me great concern as they run counter to the Tampere objectives."
"Article 7 of the Commission' s proposal on the threat to public order is clear and I think it is worrying and counter-productive to draw a parallel between immigration and terrorism."
"On the other hand, we share the view that the level of language knowledge assists in an individual' s integration but it should not, under any circumstances, be considered a condition for obtaining resident status."
"Why is this?"
"Well, quite simply because it is not an objective and precise criterion. There is no cause and effect link between a specific level of language knowledge - what level do we mean? - and integration itself."
"I myself know people who have been living in my country for ten years, and everyone says that they are perfectly integrated, despite the fact that they still have some difficulties with French."
"Lastly, I think it is unfair to introduce the requirement for suitable housing as an additional condition to avoid granting status to third-country nationals legally residing in the European Union."
"Many nationals do not have suitable housing, unfortunately, and they are not second class citizens because of this."
"Everyone would like to have suitable housing."
"It is fundamental that we create a welcoming society and acknowledge that integration is a two-way process requiring adaptation by the immigrant as well as the host society."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is certainly odd that, in 2002, we have specially to state that those who reside long-term in our Member States without being EU citizens are to be treated on something like the same terms as those of us who have happened to become EU citizens through birth."
"I find it strange that this has to be stated as something out of the ordinary."
"It stands to reason that it should be completely obvious."
"I believe that our fellow MEP, Baroness Ludford has carried out a very good piece of work."
"It is a balanced approach."
"When she points out that, by means of more common rules, we shall also prevent racism and xenophobia, I believe that she is touching upon something very important."
"We do not want citizens to be divided into an A team and a B team."
"This is a momentous issue for Europe."
"A Europe which, as we always say, is based upon humanistic values concerning the equal worth of human beings must stand up for those values."
"In that respect, I believe this to be a major and important step forward in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both rapporteurs, and I welcome these initiatives."
"I also echo Baroness Ludford's comments on the British government's lack of enthusiasm."
"It is a pity that her more progressive ideas narrowly missed endorsement in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and we now have before us a more begrudging approach to long-term residents from third countries, with an overemphasis on terrorism, language acquisition and sufficient resources, especially in the area of pensions."
"Again, I agree with Baroness Ludford's comments on the first two of those."
"The Commission's proposals were certainly better than what is now proposed in those areas."
"This says to me that the image of third-country nationals in the minds of some in this House represents only a very narrow part of the reality - in terms of a specific geography perhaps, a social class or political views."
"This image certainly does not include the overwhelming majority of third-country nationals, who contribute enormously to the economy and society of the European Union and have proved this over a number of years."
"Why else would so many of our governments be increasingly seeking to recruit from third countries at all skill levels if this were not the case?"
"Why should such people choose to come here and settle for a number of years if they are to be seen as suspect or second-class, here on sufferance only and viewed as another dimension of a disposable society?"
"As others have said, we should be looking at equal rights for people who make such contributions to our societies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am now speaking on the Ludford report, the primary purpose of which is to create better conditions for people legally resident here, over a long period of time, through according them more rights."
"That, for a start, is the right approach."
"The problem, though, is that the third-country nationals within the EU constitute a sort of third class of citizens, ranking below the citizens of the country they live in and then after the citizens of the other EU countries, who are in second place."
"The report enshrines this distinction in law and thus justifies the fact that discrimination will never be permanently absent."
"For those who really want to ensure equal rights for all, must also assimilate these differences."
"There is, though, a second point which I see as even more important, and, again, it is about enhancing the rights of long-term residents in the EU."
"Only a specific element among them is addressed here, namely those with legal resident status."
"It thus excludes all those living here illegally."
"One could say, 'OK, the illegals just do not feature in the report and so we are not going to say anything about them today' , but that is precisely the problem: we are always dealing exclusively with people with legal resident status, and almost all the other projected legislation - even own-initiative reports - has seen the failure, over and over again, of amendments intended precisely to enhance the rights of the illegals."
"The inevitable conclusion is that the illegals are simply the logical consequence of the 'fortress EU' policy, and that is why I entertain no high hopes of major changes on this point from within Parliament, the Commission or the Council in the immediate future."
"Let us then be honest enough to say that we are interested only in those who have the great good fortune to be able to enter the EU at all - under very degrading conditions and often illegally - who then play the joker and get asylum from whatever EU country it happens to be, or who simply happen to be people the capitalist system can make use of."
"There is to be no improvement in the law for all the people who fall through this particular grating."
"In my view, both these proposals contain a series of regulations which, on their own terms, are reasonable and humane."
"Baroness Ludford' s report, in particular, tries to comply with congenial demands for fair treatment and active integration. It would be a poor do if it did not."
"I have a couple of comments, however."
"We are now ensconced in Fortress Europe, and the political attitude that dominates the area in which EU legislation prevails is defined by conditions of access that are so strict as almost to make the proverbial eye of the needle look like an open barn door."
"Secondly, I have to state that the proposals before us show my own country' s government up in a disgraceful light."
"As newly appointed minister for 'Integration and Deportation' , our former fellow MEP Mr Haarder, a Liberal, has been pursuing a policy that must cause former colleagues in his political group to wonder."
"The rules now being negotiated are significantly less xenophobic than Mr Haarder' s proposals."
"Thirdly, the fact that the Danish people have acquired a xenophobic government that is further to the right than the EU rules are does not cause the People' s Movement, which I represent, to change its view of Schengen and Title IV of the Treaty on European Union from which Denmark, as is well known, is exempt."
"This technique of integration, used in certain quarters of the EU system, presents a deadly danger to democracy."
"It is not the EU that should get rid of a government for us."
"It is not the EU that should implement a humane foreign policy. It is the Danes themselves - we, the people."
"Mr President, we believe that the two draft directives presented by the Commission on the conditions of residence and movement of third-country nationals within the European Union are, to put it mildly, lagging far behind our current requirements."
"These conditions arise from a state of mind that we thought had become obsolete following the attacks of 11 September and which sought, in particular, to put unrestricted openness and movement before the security of our fellow citizens."
"Unfortunately, we must point out that this dangerous state of mind is still very much alive."
"As far as the conditions of movement of third-country nationals are concerned, for example, the draft directive abolishes the current obligation to declare themselves, under Article 22 of the Schengen Convention, when they move between EU countries."
"Each Member State retains the option of maintaining this obligation, but in a watered down form and with a longer time limit for the declaration."
"In our opinion, this is exactly the opposite of what should have been done."
"We should have examined how to make this declaration of presence more operational and more effective."
"Everyone here is aware that following 11 September, Europe has been accused of being too easy for terrorists to use as a base, because its internal borders are too porous."
"Yet, we are quite obviously considering a proposal that would increase this porosity."
"Similarly, we are opposed to introducing a specific six-month travel authorisation which is not provided for under the Treaty and which would distort its spirit, as the Treaty' s common visa policy only relates to visas valid for less than three months."
"Lastly, with regard to the second draft directive relating to third-country nationals who are long-term residents, we believe that the Community has no jurisdiction to introduce, even by unanimity, a common status comprising uniform principles."
"Article 63 of the TEU specifies only that the Council can take 'measures' relating to immigration policy in the area of entry and residence conditions, but that it cannot and must not be a question of a full status which would impose a centralised, uniform and rigid solution for all Member States."
"In particular, we do not believe it is appropriate to grant third-country nationals who benefit from this so-called status rights that remove differences between them and national citizens and grant them a virtually automatic right of stay in the other Member States."
"Those of our fellow Members who believe that we are here, first and foremost, to protect the interests of our respective peoples will vote against these two draft directives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only welcome the Commission' s initiative on the freedom of circulation of third-country nationals within the Schengen area, since this is something that I, myself, specifically wanted when we discussed the two previous reports."
"In fact, the instrument proposed certainly meets the requirements for a more global and integrated approach, which is what we had asked for."
"Congratulations, then, to the Commission for its initiative."
"Let me now turn to Mrs Kessler' s report, and say that, overall, my group supports its direction and its amendments."
"Like Mrs Kessler, we also believe that the regulation is, as it stands, a more adequate legal instrument than the directive."
"We agree with the clarifications that she has made regarding the definition of the length of time that the travel authorisation is valid."
"There is, however, one point in Mrs Kessler' s report which surprised me, speaking from a personal point of view, namely, the virtually unrelenting effort she has made to combat the Commission' s proposal, under which the holders of a long-stay visa who do not yet possess a permanent residence permit can only move around freely if they have submitted an official application for a residence permit in the Member State that issued their visa."
"In her report, Mrs Kessler writes - and I quote - 'There are no obvious grounds - what a lovely way of putting it, Mrs Kessler! - why the rules on the point at which the period of freedom to travel begins for these particular third-country nationals should be any different from those concerning the other third-country nationals covered by the same legislation.'"
"You have written 'there are no grounds for this' in your report!"
"Well, in fact, Mrs Kessler, there are grounds for this."
"What the Commission is proposing in this case is exactly what the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs voted for unanimously and what this entire House approved when it voted in favour of my report on the French initiative."
"The truth, Mrs Kessler, is that we are in line with the Council' s position that Parliament rejected whilst approving the report that I have just mentioned."
"There are therefore grounds for this, Mrs Kessler, both institutions share the same view, how on earth can you not recognise that?"
"Mr President, I would like to refer to Baroness Ludford' s report."
"Before we deal with other aspects of immigration policy, a common status is needed for third-country nationals who are long-term residents in strict compliance with the Tampere Agreements, the aim of which was to give these third-country nationals a set of uniform rights comparable with those enjoyed by EU citizens."
"We need to resolve situations such as those that, in theory, hinder the free movement of third-country nationals within the EU today."
"For this reason my group hopes that this House will send a strong message, directed mainly at the Council, supporting the European Commission proposal."
"In this regard, I would personally like to thank Baroness Ludford for her work."
"We cannot accept some of the amendments that have been adopted in Committee or that have been submitted once again to this House."
"As Mrs Roure mentioned, we cannot allow subjective issues to obstruct the authority to grant this long-term resident status and, even less so, dangerous propaganda exercises that draw parallels, not between border controls and terrorism, as used to be said, but between long-term residents and terrorists, or, at the very least, terrorism."
"Once again we are going to defend the right for third-country nationals who are long-term residents to vote in local and European elections."
"I can only hope that, despite the numerous empty places on the Council benches, this message will leave Parliament and be heard."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in actual fact, we are discussing two subjects which are quite distinct although closely connected."
"Indeed, a joint debate on immigration is taking place on two fronts: the first concerns the recognition of the status of long-term legally resident third-country nationals; the second concerns the regulation of the stay in a Member State and the freedom to travel for fixed periods and for specific reasons."
"Certainly, the first proposal would appear to be more important in that it seeks to establish the conditions under which citizens of third countries who are long-term residents in a Member State, within the meaning of the directive, can also travel to a different Member State of the Union from that in which they have been granted residence."
"The debate on the directive within the Council is encountering obvious difficulties because the matter is so broad and sensitive."
"Many States are still striving to define a clear position on the various provisions of the directive, taking into account the different situations and dispositions too."
"Moreover, the extent to which States are affected varies as well: for example, in certain geographical areas, such as Italy, the problem of immigration is clearly more acute, and it is more severe and more urgent than in others."
"It must be pointed out once again that there are other factors related to the main issue, including, for example, family reunion projects and other asylum projects, not to mention the complex issue of refugees."
"In general, we would advocate the approach of those governments which are attempting to establish a direct link - a dialogue, we might say - between the directive and national legislation."
"This is what we are doing in Italy: striving, as I said, to move ahead with this proposal."
"However, once we have laid down certain minimum criteria, it is still necessary to leave each Member State to decide how best to implement its own legislation."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words on the Ludford report on the rights of long-term residents."
"My apologies for missing the first few minutes of this debate but, amongst a number of problems today, I was held up in the passport queue at the airport."
"Ahead of me were two UK passport holders but, being of Asian origin, they were being subjected to what I consider to be quite unacceptable levels of interrogation."
"Colleagues around the House will know that is all too typical at customs points all around Europe."
"My apologies also to Baroness Ludford."
"Mr Medina said earlier that some of the amendments that went through committee weakened the Commission's original proposal."
"It was due, in part, to the lack of numbers on my own side that these amendments went through in committee, so I apologise for that."
"We should strive as far as possible to give all long-term residents the same rights as EU citizens."
"We should reject the PPE-DE amendments which seek to classify long-term residents as somehow second-class citizens."
"As Mrs Roure said, we should encourage people to integrate and I support their efforts to learn languages."
"But using an individual's progress in language as a criterion as to whether to grant long-term status is discriminatory."
"If the ability to speak your home nation's language properly was generally used as a measure of the right of residency, I can think of a lot of people back home who would not have the right to live there!"
"Other parts of this report, which state that proof of adequate retirement cover is a prerequisite for third-country nationals obtaining some rights or the same rights, are equally subjective."
"We cannot invite people to the European Union only to say ""pay your taxes here, but do not expect any social services or social benefits in return""."
"That is perpetuating a second-class citizen status."
"Two hundred years ago our ancestors charged around the world, colonising and abusing distant countries."
"We have a right and a duty now to set society straight and to put our own house in order."
"We must urge all Member States to educate our own citizens much more fully as to the benefits and positive advantages of having an integrated society."
"In a few years there will come a time when new EU Member States will be crying out for third-country nationals to come to help them with their economies and to fill employment vacancies."
"We must have things sorted out by then."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report - by which I mean not the draft report, but the report that has emerged from the Committee into the plenary session - shows real evidence of a firm grip on reality."
"It takes into account the lessons we have to learn from 11 September, and also the guidelines on immigrant workers that we passed on a very broad basis in plenary session."
"I therefore also welcome the conclusion that it comes to, namely the checks before long-term resident status is granted, such as the requirement for legal residence over a period of five years and checks being made as to whether the person in question has sufficient funds available for himself and for the family that can expect him to provide for them, or the requirement that he has a job and has social and retirement insurance."
"I also, in view of what happened on 11 September, welcome the introduction of security checks."
"We have no need of criminals, or of people who represent a danger to the European Union's public safety and order."
"I also appreciate the fact that the Member States will be enabled to introduce checks on other criteria such as language skills, housing accommodation and more along similar lines. Again, in relation to criminal offences, the increased scope for deportation is also a positive sign."
"I welcome these regulations because they are in step with the granting of an ordered sequence of privileges along the lines of: access to employment, education, social security and integration, and this is also to be embraced."
"We in the European People's Party declare our support for the controlled acceptance of third-country nationals, so that integration may actually be facilitated and the EU's security and stability may continue to be guaranteed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Baroness Ludford and Mrs Kessler, for the detailed work that they have presented to the European Parliament today."
"In our view, the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents in the territory of a Member State is a fundamental aspect of drawing up a common immigration policy."
"The status of long-term residents puts admission policies in a long-term perspective, providing third-country nationals who wish to do so the guarantee of being able to reside for a long time in their State of reception."
"This status, as the Commission proposes it, would give these people the legal security necessary to be able to integrate successfully into European societies."
"The objective that was declared in Tampere and reiterated in Laeken is to guarantee legal immigrants equal treatment and ensure that they have comparable rights and obligations to those of the European Union' s own citizens."
"The Commission proposal set the objective of approximating the rights of long-term residents with those of citizens of the Union."
"We defined the precise and objective conditions to which the access of third-country nationals to the status of long-term resident is subject."
"The conditions that we proposed were worded in such a way as to assess whether the third-country national has, in fact, established his or her long-term residence in the Member State in question and whether he or she intends to integrate into that country."
"This person must have lived in this Member State for a sufficiently long period (five years) and have proved that he or she has integrated economically by demonstrating an income and sickness insurance. Furthermore, the person in question must not represent a threat to public order."
"The report that you are now discussing also suggests a further condition that will improve the person' s status: a mastery of the language of the country of residence."
"The Commission considers that language is a criterion for integration and, therefore, language learning must be at the heart of the new integration policies. The Commission is carrying out a study on these policies, in line with its communication of November 2000, and intends to present an initiative on the subject to Parliament and the Council in 2003."
"Hence my willingness to consider the language issue, which is proposed in an amendment tabled by Mrs Klamt, particularly in its objective dimension and, specifically, when the State of reception provides immigrants with proper conditions for learning."
"With regard to adding a new requirement for old age pensions or retirement pensions, I do not feel it would be useful to increase the conditions to be fulfilled in order for the status of long-term resident to be granted."
"The legislation of most Member States already grants this status automatically, without checking whether the condition of old age pensions has been fulfilled."
"This matter must be seen as part of a broader and more complex issue that involves the relationship between migrant workers and social security systems in general."
"And, therefore, the Commission is working on extending the benefits of Regulation No 1408/71, on the coordination of social security systems, to third-country nationals."
"We also feel that this is the context in which this matter should be addressed."
"With regard to some of the proposals for amendments that have been tabled, the Commission takes the view that only when the status of long-term resident is granted will the beneficiary be able to enjoy equal treatment in comparison with the nationals of Member States in practically all areas of socio-economic life."
"Nevertheless, we are sensitive to the proposals for amendments that have been tabled to enshrine, even before this status is granted, equal treatment in the field of legal proceedings and access to legal remedy as stated in the amendments tabled by Baroness Ludford, and we shall, therefore, incorporate them into the text."
"With regard to participation in political life, the Commission is not stating an opinion, because it takes the view that there is no legal basis in the Treaties for us to address this issue."
"Some of the amendments that have been proposed reflect particular concern about the issue of public order, a concern that is totally understandable following the events of 11 September."
"I share the opinion that has been expressed here in the course of the debate, according to which we must avoid making the mistake of creating a dangerous link between immigration and terrorism, which would lead to a type of generalised suspicion towards all third-country nationals."
"The Commission drafted a working paper on the relationship between safeguarding domestic security and respecting our obligations and international instruments in the field of protection."
"In light of this document, we have checked all of the clauses on the protection of public order contained in our proposals."
"The aim of this work was to ensure that the Member States were in a position to effectively protect public order in the face of the threat posed by terrorism."
"This study led the Commission to review some of its proposals, including this proposal, specifically with regard to two points: we removed the requirement for the threat to be effective before residency status is granted, thereby providing for cases of potential risk as they can already be interpreted in light of the current wording of the Geneva Convention of 1951; we also removed the ban on implementing emergency expulsion measures as long as certain requirements are met."
"I would say that these two amendments involve the concerns of guaranteeing domestic security and the fight against the terrorism, and that, for this reason, the amendments proposed should not be considered."
"Finally, the innovation and the considerable added value of this proposal lie in the right granted to holders of long-term resident status to move to another Member State."
"In this case, integration works already not only at national level, but also at European level."
"And those individuals who have resided in a Member State for a certain amount of time will be in an advantageous position in comparison with those who come directly from their country of origin, should they wish to move to another Member State."
"I think that this is a very important aspect, and should, therefore, not be ignored."
"With regard to the proposal on the free movement and the freedom to travel of third-country nationals, for which Mrs Kessler is rapporteur, I should like, first of all, to point out that the proposal contains important aspects in terms of the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The fact is that the Schengen acquis already contains rules on the movement of third-country nationals."
"Nevertheless, the conditions for the exercise of this freedom to travel are not always transparent and are spread out across various instruments."
"The Commission shares the European Parliament' s opinion that we must pool together in a single legal instrument all the fragmented elements that define this freedom to travel."
"The proposal, therefore, lays down the conditions that enable third-country nationals to move around freely whether or not they are subject to visa requirements, whether they have residency papers or have a long-term visa, whilst they are waiting for residency papers to be issued."
"Furthermore, this proposal is also intended to regulate the travel of various categories of people that have a legitimate interest in remaining for a period of between three and six months within the border-free area without their situation being equated with immigration in the true sense of the word."
"Examples of these are tourists, investigators, musicians on tour, individuals on family visits, and those undergoing hospitalisation and convalescence."
"The introduction of a specific travel permit that allows travel for a maximum period of six months, whilst not spending more than three months in the territory of the same Member State is planned for these categories of people, which complies fully with the letter of the Treaty."
"Most of the proposals for amendments featured in Mrs Kessler' s report are designed to explain and clarify the content of our proposal."
"With regard to the issue of the legal instrument, the choice proposed is for a regulation rather than a directive."
"Where all these proposals are concerned, the Commission supports any solution that ensures a positive response from the Council."
"The only point on which we do not agree with the proposal by Mrs Kessler concerns Amendment No 5 on movement within border-free areas with a long-stay visa, which, as Mr Deprez has already emphasised, must be carefully studied."
"We ask Parliament not to approve it."
"A long-stay visa is a national visa, which will be issued in accordance with national rules and not in accordance with the rules of Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Schengen Implementing Convention."
"From this point of view, I think it would be difficult, where the long-stay visa is concerned, to impose the rules that have been planned for short-stay visas, in other words, by prior consultation."
"Parliament has already rejected this type of proposal, during the debate on the French initiative on the long-stay visa, and contested the legal basis specifically and the fragmented approach overall."
"From this very angle, which Parliament had already approved, the Commission also contested the legal basis and declared that it would, in any event, submit a proposal that will also include holders of a long-stay visa and that it would once again pursue the objective of the French initiative, making it part of a broader framework."
"I share the concern underlying Amendment No 5, which envisages the possibility of a third-country national travelling immediately within the border-free area. This possibility, however, already exists today because a third-country national can always request a uniform visa, the so-called 'C' visa, and move around freely on that basis."
"To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs. I hope that the proposals tabled by the Commission receive the across-the-board support of Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Relief, rehabilitation and development"
"The next item is the report (A5-0464/2001) by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on Linking relief, rehabilitation and development - an assessment. (COM(2001) 153 - C5-0395/2001 - 2001/2153(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioners, the European Union is the world' s largest donor in terms of relief."
"Thanks to European funding, people who are hit by war or natural disasters in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Balkans are helped to get back on their feet."
"However, things too often go wrong when direct relief is discontinued and a switch is made to aid for the reconstruction and development of the affected area."
"This problem is referred to in specialist literature as the grey zone."
"Allow me to illustrate this with a textbook example. After Hurricane Mitch left a trail of destruction in Central America in 1998, the Union responded quickly with relief."
"As from 1999, the Commission subsequently worked on an action programme for reconstruction in Central America, and ECHO was set to leave the area from March 2001 onwards."
"The action programme contained some sound elements, such as local participation, coordination with the Member States and other donors, and decentralisation of powers to the delegation in Managua."
"In practice, however, the programme moved far too slowly."
"Two years after the disaster, only a few projects had been rubberstamped."
"This example unfortunately illustrates the rule and not the exception, and this is of course unacceptable, both from a political and humanitarian perspective."
"Who would like to explain soon to the people in Afghanistan that we are unable to keep our pledge of aid due to our own inability to respond promptly and with due flexibility following the relief phase?"
"The question arises as to what measures the Commission is taking to prevent the problem of the grey zone from occurring during the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"During the preparation of this report, the Commission and the organisations involved in the field were consulted extensively."
"The Commission recognises the problem of the grey zone but, at the same time, its evaluation, which we are discussing today, remains too vague and too theoretical."
"That is why a number of specific proposals are being submitted to the Commission in my report, partly on the basis of the conference with the NGOs involved and intensive talks with your official services."
"The Commission recognises that inflexible and bureaucratic procedures form one of the key problems."
"By way of solution, the Commission would like to draw up appendices to the Country Strategy Papers as a result of which a rapid and flexible reaction in a crisis situation must become possible."
"I support this proposal, but only if those appendices are approved within a two-month period."
"Can the Commission give an indication as to whether it has already drafted new, simplified, rapid and flexible procedures for the approval and adjustment of the appendices?"
"For otherwise, the proposal for these crisis papers will simply remain a hollow exercise."
"In addition, in my capacity as rapporteur, I would refer to the enormous importance of coordination and cooperation, not only between the Commission services but also with the Member States, international donors, local partners and NGOs."
"From my talks with the Commission, it transpired that there is a clear need for a flexible instrument for construction and rehabilitation, so that this grey zone can be dealt with."
"The existing rehabilitation regulation is too restricted."
"Projects in the field of security and good governance, for example, fall outside the scope of the Regulation, and resources are limited."
"It is evident that the total amount of, for example, some EUR 50 million for Asia lags far behind the level of need in Afghanistan."
"That is why I suggest reviewing the existing rehabilitation regulation, so that, in the post-crisis stage, the real needs of the people in an affected area can be accommodated in a flexible manner."
"In order to guarantee sufficient funding, it is important that, as soon as a crisis breaks out, resources are freed up quickly via a trigger mechanism from the existing non-used budget and reserves."
"In what way does the Commission want to act upon my plan in terms of concrete proposals?"
"The problem of the grey zone between relief and rehabilitation is well-known."
"It is no longer acceptable for people who are directly faced with the effects of war or natural disasters on a daily basis to be left out in the cold due to our inability to react to the local situation in a rapid, flexible and coordinated manner."
"Since Europe, being the world' s largest relief donor, plays a fantastic role, we must, as Europe, close this gap by means of sustainable development in crisis areas."
"That would truly constitute an enormous contribution to security and stability in conflict regions in Asia, Latin America and Africa."
"This might well be a wiser investment than committing substantial sums for defence materiel, such as F16s, at this stage, although I know that the Commission is not concerned with these matters."
"As your rapporteur, I will therefore closely follow how the Commission and the Member States tackle this problem in the near future."
"I expect a great deal from the pledge made thus far, but I am anxious to know what the Commission' s actual response will be."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who is prevented from being with us today by air traffic problems, I would like to make a few observations on the Commission communication with regard to the difficult concept of the linkage between relief, rehabilitation and development."
"I would like to thank Mr van den Berg for his excellent work, on which a broad consensus was achieved at the vote in committee."
"First of all, I feel that it is vital to improve complementarity, coherence and the cost-benefit ratio, for these are necessary to bridge the gap between the various stages of international assistance, the famous grey zone, and, more generally, for the effectiveness of the Union' s development and cooperation policy overall."
"Indeed, the multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the various UN agencies and the Paris Club need to be more involved in this process."
"Moreover, it would seem appropriate to distinguish between internal and external coordination action in order to establish who does what at both European and international level and also at the level of the individual Member States; this would make it easier to plan and therefore make us more effective in implementing rehabilitation and development initiatives."
"The contribution of our group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, focuses precisely on the need for greater complementarity, particularly as per Amendments Nos 15 and 16 tabled by Mr Mantovani, and for better coordination of the different actions, in order to obtain greater effectiveness and improved results in the action linking and coordinating relief, rehabilitation and development; in particular, there is a call for appropriate coordination and ex post evaluation methods, budgetary control and less bureaucratic interference, to provide a greater guarantee of Union development aid reaching the countries in crisis, and therefore precisely the people who genuinely need it, effectively and without time wasting or needless duplication or overlapping of effort or financial resources invested."
"Mr President, like Max van den Berg in his report, we are in favour of the Commission' s communication on the links between the European Union' s actions in emergency situations in the countries of the South and the Community' s development cooperation policy."
"In committee, there was some agreement with the communication we are assessing here, but there are also shortcomings which the proposals contained in the resolution we will vote on later are aimed at resolving."
"This resolution includes a series of concerns and recommendations aimed at improving, in practice, the European Union' s action in the field under discussion, which we hope will be accepted."
"The whole of this debate demonstrates that there is a dialectical relationship between humanitarian aid, which the European Union mobilises in order to deal with emergency situations resulting from all types of disaster, and the aid which is regularly granted with a view to promoting the development of a particular region or country."
"That is to say that programmes aimed at rehabilitation or development must include within them elements aimed to preventing conflicts and preventing, where possible, so-called 'natural' disasters and their worst consequences."
"Furthermore, actions in cases of emergency must contribute, where possible, to the eventual rehabilitation and development of the region in question."
"Today we are recognising that there are considerable dysfunctions within the European Union' s actions in terms of the transition from one area to another."
"The majority are due to the distribution between administrative bodies and the distribution of competences as well as deficient coordination between the services which are involved in programming and the implementation of those actions."
"Another obstacle is the bureaucratic complexity of many mechanisms employed for this purpose."
"What seems more serious to us is that there are countries with which the European Union still has no cooperation agreement, such as Cuba, which prevent us from acting in situations of emergency or prevent humanitarian aid from having the desired continuity in the field of development cooperation."
"The Commission is good at carrying out analyses but often lacks the clout to actually implement policy conclusions."
"The internal organisation is still too hierarchical, bureaucratic and centralised, and the Member States give the Commission too few resources and too little policy leeway for it to be able to take decisive action."
"These structural shortcomings therefore stand in the way of solving the problem of the grey zone."
"The transition from relief to reconstruction and development requires flexibility in the decision-making process."
"Sluggishness and too much interference can affect the intended results even more adversely than the technical risks, which can be accompanied by speedy procedures. Needless to say, what we need first of all is the best possible prevention policy with regard to natural disasters and violent conflicts."
"Everything possible must be done before a crisis breaks out."
"The state of readiness must be at its best, plans must be ready, cooperatives must be arranged and the implementation partners must be identified as far as possible."
"Detailed and flexible disaster plans must form part of the Country Strategy Papers."
"ECHO must focus on relief, but it seems very desirable that it also employ staff with expertise in the field of reconstruction in order to make the transition smoother."
"The monitoring procedure regarding implementation must shift from ex ante to ex post."
"Internal coordination can only be effective if a multidisciplinary team is deployed at an early stage."
"When can we expect specific Commission proposals for simplified policy procedures?"
"The report by Mr Van den Berg makes excellent suggestions."
"The entire donor community is responsible for improvement."
"The grey zone problem is an additional reason for speeding up the Commission' s internal reorganisation."
"It is high time splendid analyses were translated into still more splendid policy action."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his excellent report on linking relief, rehabilitation and development."
"It is an enormously important subject, fraught with problems."
"There is no doubt at all that there is an increase in disasters worldwide, both man-made, as in Afghanistan, and natural, such as in Goma, DRC."
"It needs the full cooperation of all parties to have most effect: the donors, the beneficiaries, implementing parties like governments and NGOs, and bilateral aid."
"In Afghanistan we have seen the bombing and destruction that has taken place."
"That will mean urgent and instant relief, the rehabilitation of millions of refugees and development aid."
"It was horrifying to see in today's paper that a poor family has sold its twelve-year-old daughter into marriage just to get enough food to feed the rest of the family."
"This is tragic."
"So getting aid to those most in need is absolutely vital and that requires local knowledge and the right kind of aid."
"Two weeks ago ECHO informed the Committee on Development and Cooperation that the situation in Goma was totally under control and that everything that was required was there."
"That very night we heard NGOs stating on the television that 90,000 were starving and that babies were already dying."
"Is this opportunism, accurate evidence or over-reacting?"
"It is almost impossible to plan for natural disasters."
"It is better to have a centralised European depot that can react quickly in an appropriate way."
"Linkage is all about cooperation and one body being responsible for decisions."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking you for giving me the floor on this important subject."
"If I may now change to the language which Mr van den Berg and I have in common, I should like to say the following."
", Commission. (NL) In the first instance, I should like to congratulate Mr Van den Berg on the exceptional quality of his report on what is, in fact, a relatively complex subject."
"Crisis situations are always complex, and we must reach consensus on the way in which the reaction of the Union as a whole can be improved on."
"The Commission communication, the Council' s conclusions and the parliamentary report contribute to establishing this consensus."
"Mr President, as you know, the European Union is one of the key players in the world' s relief circuit."
"The European Community and its Member States together account for half of the international aid programmes funded by the developed countries."
"Via its Bureau for humanitarian aid, better known under the name of ECHO, the European Commission is actively involved in providing humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable and worst afflicted people in the world."
"The figures speak for themselves."
"Last year alone, ECHO made more than EUR 500 million available for humanitarian projects in some 80 countries which reached some 18 million people."
"ECHO's task remains that of funding the coordinated provision of humanitarian aid and that of providing protection via humanitarian partner organisations with a view to saving and protecting lives, alleviating suffering and safeguarding the integrity and dignity of the peoples of third countries in humanitarian crises."
"Although ECHO's key task is to grant humanitarian relief, the Bureau is also involved in short-term rehabilitation in the immediate post-crisis phase."
"I think we can all be agreed that improvements need to be made in the grey zone between relief and development."
"The speakers this evening also referred to this."
"We have all identified the same difficulties, such as the unduly slow decision-making processes, problems related to the scope of financing instruments and the need to find the right implementing partners."
"We make progress by tackling these issues more systematically, but we must realise that we are not able to solve all the problems connected with the complex nature of these situations, and we must remain realistic in our approach."
"The Commission has set up a series of actions for implementing policy in directions that reflect the link between relief, rehabilitation and development."
"For example, ECHO is currently putting the finishing touches to guidelines for its exit strategies."
"This document will become the basis for consultation with other services of the Commission, describing the circumstances under which ECHO can withdraw from granting relief."
"The services of the Commission are also working on an agreement to guarantee effective coordination and appropriate procedures in the framework of the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement with the countries in Africa, the Caribbean region and the Pacific."
"The principles stated in the communication and concerning the link between relief, rehabilitation and development should be applied."
"Europ I is actively working on an agenda to improve its working methods and so increase its capacity for rapid interventions."
"From a budgetary point of view, the Commission realises that its operational resources and instruments must be reviewed."
"We are of the opinion that the number of budget lines must be reduced."
"On the other hand, it must be ensured that broader regulations are still able to cover all existing types of activities, that the speed of decision-making is stepped up, that there is flexibility in the choice of implementing partners and that, if necessary, decisions can be taken without the approval of the government in question."
"On the basis of experience, we believe that further integration of our interventions using the existing regional instruments is the right way forward and that this must lead to greater policy coherence and a higher level of complementarity between the different types of intervention within one and the same country."
"In response to different questions raised this evening, I should once again like to emphasise that the complementarity of the different instruments in the reconstruction process in Afghanistan illustrates the approach pursued by the Commission."
"Finally, I should like to stress one important aspect."
"We must be fully aware of the fact that intervening in the immediate post-crisis phase means that we have to accept higher political and technical risks."
"I should like to point this out with due emphasis."
"For that reason, the debate which we held with the Council last year, together with your report of today, are welcomed by the Commission as contributions towards a more effective response to crises and the achievement of greater coherence between relief and development."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"Workers' rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"Report (A5-0013/2002) by Hughes, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities (PE-CONS 3676/2001 - C5-0688/2001 - 1998/0319(COD));"
"Report (A5-0026/2002) by Ghilardotti, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive establishing a general framework for improving information and consultation rights of employees in the European Community (PE-CONS 3677/2001 - C5-0687/2001 - 1998/0315(COD))."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Friedrich who was the Vice-President in charge of the conciliation on road transport, and also Mr Rocard who took part as chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs; in fact, all members of Parliament's delegation, because it was very much a team effort."
"Thanks are due to Commissioner Palacio and her staff for the crucial part they played at several points when it seemed we were at deadlock."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Belgian presidency for the energetic and determined way they pursued agreement on this dossier."
"The outcome of the conciliation on road transport is very much to be welcomed."
"It plugs one of the last remaining gaps in the working-time mosaic."
"It is profoundly important from the point of view of health and safety, and road safety more generally, and it is also important from the point of view of ensuring fair competition between the road, rail and other transport sectors."
"On specifics, first we have secured the inclusion of self-employed drivers as a matter of principle."
"Some will be disappointed that will not take full effect until four years beyond transposition."
"But we should not forget that the Council's common position would almost certainly have led to the permanent exclusion of the self-employed."
"The Council wanted to exclude them in principle and only consider including them on the basis of a Commission study looking at possible distortions at some point in the future."
"Even then the Council would have been determined to block such a move from the Commission."
"We now have a total reversal of that situation."
"The self-employed are included as a matter of principle and can only be excluded if two things happen: first, if the Commission proposes such an exclusion; and secondly, if we, as co-legislator here in Parliament, agree with such an exclusion."
"Neither of those things is very likely to happen."
"Another important point in the outcome is a strong definition of self-employment."
"Even with only a temporary exclusion of the self-employed, we felt it was very important that we won a clear and limiting definition of what a self-employed driver actually is, to avoid unscrupulous employers pushing drivers into false forms of independence."
"We now have a very clear definition in Article 3(e), and the final sentence of that article is a catch-all: drivers who are not caught by the checklist of criteria included in the definition will be dealt with as though they are employees under the directive."
"That is an extremely useful definition."
"We have also considerably improved and clarified the definition of working time."
"It also now applies to the self-employed except in respect of general administrative work, not linked directly to the specific transport operation under way."
"On night work, I again know that some will be disappointed that we did not succeed in limiting night work to eight hours."
"I will make three quick points regarding that."
"It would have been impossible to get that through Council."
"Most delegations were against."
"There are valid environmental and road safety reasons to transport goods - if they must be transported by road - at night."
"Concession on night work became a key in securing the inclusion of the self-employed."
"This is a joint debate involving consideration of the importance of work, information and consultation."
"Members will see from Article 8 concerning derogations on weekly working time and night work that we have insisted upon the promotion of social dialogue as the first option."
"My final point is that certain aspects of the text before us are highly relevant to the state of affairs being brought to light by the Kralowetz case."
"Those aspects seeking to block the creation of false independent status, dealing with record-keeping, and placing a focus on the duties of consigners and others responsible for determining routes and timetables, are particularly relevant."
"But Kralowetz makes two things glaringly obvious."
"First, in the enlargement process we desperately need additional social safeguard measures and a socially controlled opening of the labour market for workers from central and Eastern Europe, particularly in this sector."
"Secondly, it is glaringly clear that if the level of control exposed by this case continues, important texts like this one will be worth less than the paper they are printed on."
"We must insist on full and proper application of controls across the European Union."
"My final point is that it is absolutely essential that we have European-wide rules that are binding throughout the territories of the European Union, otherwise the Kralowetz case will be just one of many which we will see in the weeks and months to come."
"Mr President, today' s debate and tomorrow' s vote in the Chamber mark the end of a long, difficult path which the three institutions have been following for some years, conducting a frank, heated debate on a subject of major importance: the information, consultation and participation of workers."
"With conciliation, which was concluded satisfactorily on 17 December last, the European Union defined minimum information and consultation standards to be applied throughout Union territory."
"Thus, after the directives on European Works Councils, the European Company Statute and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this directive completes the existing Community and national frameworks, which can help to ensure that necessary preparations are made for the change, that restructuring is carried out in an acceptable context and that the 'employment' objective is given the necessary priority in the current situation."
"It seems to me particularly significant that agreement has been reached before the Barcelona Summit."
"Almost all the Member States have a legal framework in place - either statutory or contractual in origin - which seeks to ensure that workers are informed and consulted: almost all, I said, but not all, and this directive extends the right so that it exists throughout the Union."
"Basically, this directive recognises the rights of workers and their representatives in all undertakings with less than 50 employees to be informed and consulted about all aspects of the life of the undertaking, particularly the implications of company choices on employment, the organisation of work, training and skill development."
"It is important that the directive should focus on the content and procedures, including time frames, for informing and consulting workers."
"It explicitly lays down that information and consultation must be timely, for that is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation processes of undertakings and of processes identifying anticipatory measures necessary to offset negative impact on workers."
"It recognises a number of rights of workers' representatives and of workers themselves; it lays down sanctions that the Member States have to introduce into their own legislation - when implementing and applying the directive - effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions."
"I feel that this is a particularly important point and it has been the subject of much debate."
"The Commission' s initial plan, supported by Parliament, was to lay down a European sanction."
"However, in respect for the principle of subsidiarity, the directive stipulates that the Member States themselves should introduce sanctions."
"A transitional period is also laid down for those States which do not yet have any statutory system - either legal or contractual - although it is shorter than that provided for in the common position."
"Clearly, the European Parliament would have liked more: it would have liked more specific information, clearer definition and more content, but considering the sensitivity of the subject and the resistance in recent months from both governments and lobbies, I feel that we can consider ourselves satisfied with the result."
"The Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee voted unanimously for this agreement."
"We can be satisfied because rights are recognised, the social dialogue is given due importance and the principle of subsidiarity is respected while a uniform framework is defined for the entire territory of the Union: there will no longer be A class workers and B class workers when it comes to the rights recognised in undertakings."
"I want to end by thanking, in particular, the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, and her staff, the Belgian Presidency and Mrs Onkelinx."
"I would point out that we were three women, the three of us, in particular, working on this directive."
"I feel that it was our determination and our strong awareness of the major importance of the subject, not least - supported as we were, I by my committee and Parliament and the Commissioner and the Minister by their convictions - which enabled us to bring such a vital process to a conclusion."
"In my opinion, the Barcelona Summit will be a good opportunity for us to see whether our conclusions have a positive, practical impact."
"Mr President, I am under the impression that Parliament would like me to make a statement on the case of the road haulage driver stuck in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg."
"If that is the case, then I should like to say the following."
"Based on the information at the Commission's disposal, the Luxembourg authorities conducted a search on behalf of an inquiry led by the Tribunal of Munich in Germany of the premises in Luxembourg of an Austrian-based transport operator Kralowetz."
"This company has been active in Luxembourg since 1986 and was an international one established in eight different European countries."
"The technical manager, Mr Karl Kralowetz, was arrested on 22 January, and since 26 January approximately 150 lorries belonging to the Kralowetz company from different countries have assembled in Luxembourg on a parking bay of a customs centre and the drivers have complained that they have not been paid for more than three months."
"The majority of them may be considered as illegally employed."
"The Luxembourg authorities are in the process of organising the return of the drivers by plane to their country of origin and each driver will receive EUR 1,000 by way of compensation."
"The real problem is the unscrupulous behaviour of the transport operator concerned."
"He had used illegal labour - i.e. without social security status - with a salary which is not in conformity with national law or collective agreements and without a work permit."
"For several months the judicial authorities and rogatory committees of several Member States have been conducting investigations and enquiries and drawing up reports."
"All those actions have resulted in further searches, the arrest of some of those responsible and the confiscation of documents and equipment."
"The Commission welcomes the action of the judicial and administrative authorities but, nevertheless, regrets that such an affair could ever have been possible at all."
"This proves the need for a correct application of national laws, as well as the following Community rules in the field of international road transport operations."
"Firstly, the rules on admission to the occupation of road-transport operator, namely the three criteria of good repute, financial standing and professional competence; secondly, the rules on driving times and rest periods, for which the Commission has recently made a proposal for new, simplified and updated EU legislation."
"In addition, the following upcoming legal instruments are also relevant; firstly, the rules on working time, on which an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council is very much to be welcomed, and on which you will vote tomorrow."
"I should mention here the Commission's particular thanks to Mr Hughes."
"Secondly, the rules on a uniform driver attestation, for which Mr van Dam was your rapporteur, and for which the European Parliament gave its approval on 17 January."
"That regulation will put to an end the illegal employment of non-EU drivers in the Community, through checks on the legal employment status of such drivers."
"In conclusion, Community instruments exist or are in the process of being adopted."
"They need to be correctly applied by Member States, and this example should serve as a lesson to avoid any further repetition of such unscrupulous behaviour by cowboy operators."
"The example which Mr Bolkestein quoted a moment ago is, of course, a blatant, and probably exceptional, example of the abuses in the transport sector."
"It is not the only example."
"We have witnessed various such examples over the past few years, almost on the same scale as the example we heard about a moment ago."
"In addition to the many abuses on a large scale, there are also many abuses on a small scale, for the transport sector is largely characterised by abuses."
"The system before us, involving stricter standards for working hours - indeed, not only driving hours are referred to, but also working hours - involves a tightening-up on the system used in the past."
"This can only work if the monitoring procedure is improved."
"If this does not happen - and I agree with what Mr Hughes has said - all these standards will be meaningless."
"Although monitoring is a national competence, a two-yearly report on the results of the monitoring procedure, which is to be submitted to the Commission, must still be drawn up."
"I would like to ask the Commission to give its attention to this report once more and to reconsider the requirements made of the Member States in this connection."
"One of the aspects which the Commission is apparently verifying is whether foreign hauliers are subject to stricter monitoring than domestic hauliers, the latter being of one' s own nationality."
"Needless to say, this should not be used as a criterion."
"The Commission is right to investigate this, but it should widen the investigation as long as hauliers allow people to drive for too long at excessive speeds, because they are often required to arrive at their destination at a certain time."
"Commissioner - and I am aware that this is not within your competence - as long as the Member States apply different speed limits, this is all useless."
"The speed limit is 90 km/hour in one Member State, 100 km/hour in another and 80 km/hour in the next."
"Surely, the way in which transport in Europe is organised is sheer madness."
"This should all be improved."
"In addition to monitoring, there is also the problem of penalties, which differ from one Member State to another."
"Actually, in the field of penalties, minimum standards should exist."
"I know that, at present, this is not a European competence, but this should change."
"Finally, as long as hauliers' and truckers' tachographs have to be inspected, cheating will always take place, because the tachograph is an instrument which ideally lends itself to this."
"It is therefore high time that the regulation we are waiting for were issued, stipulating that, in future, digital boxes must be fitted in cabs."
"Mr President, given the time constraints, I shall omit the congratulations which I had in mind."
"Mrs Ghilardotti, I, too, had noticed that many women have been involved in these reports, both your report and that on working hours, and both during the Belgian Presidency and within the European Commission."
"This is a good result, in my view."
"Normally, I am not one for using big words, certainly not as long as a negotiation process is still running, but now that we have reached the end of it, I shall venture to use superlatives after all and refer to the achievement of both these agreements as historic."
"To start with, it is very good that, after a long time, European labour legislation is now being laid down again."
"This fits in with the pursuit of a socio-economically ambitious Europe, as expressed in the Lisbon objectives, a dynamic and competitive economy with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"It is useful to stress the latter part of these objectives once again on the eve of the Barcelona Summit."
"Historic steps are being taken in both areas."
"The directive on information and consultation of employees forms an essential recognition of the right of employees to be involved beforehand in a company' s important decisions, and this forms part of the mores and the traditions of the European social model."
"Innovation in terms of economic activity is necessary, but it also requires a pro-active approach which also takes employee participation seriously."
"In the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, this is recognised as a fundamental right."
"This directive elaborates upon this as a right for all companies in the Union."
"A third step is required for, if we take this employee participation seriously, it should also apply to restructuring and changes in companies."
"The Commission issued a document on this subject recently."
"I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein' s presence this evening, for it is particularly important in my view for this discussion also to be held concerning other areas and for the matter of employee participation to be raised in other areas too, for example in the case of take-overs and mergers of companies, and also in Commissioner Monti' s competition policy."
"In my opinion, this should be a very important discussion in future for, there too, employee participation should form a part of the tradition and routine."
"As for drivers' working hours, I should like to concur with what Mr Hughes said about the case which is running in Luxembourg."
"I should like to emphasise once more that a definition of the pseudo self-employed, devised at European level, can play a vital role in solving problems of this kind, because we do not have a European definition of this at the moment. However, the Member States, including the new countries, use their own definitions."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the agreement reached in conciliation between Parliament and the Council on the directive on the organisation of the working time in the road transport sector and on the directive on information and consultation of employees."
"Given the delicate nature of the latter problem and the difficulties encountered in reaching an agreement, we believe that the adoption of the text under the conciliation procedure is a good solution."
"The directive on working time in the road transport sector aims to do away with situations where unfair competition and social dumping exist in the single market."
"Rules are also needed in order to guarantee suitable working conditions for drivers and thus prevent a decline in safety."
"Parliament asked for self-employed drivers to be included within the scope of the directive and demonstrated the need to treat all drivers equally, whether or not they are salaried employees."
"The inclusion of self-employed drivers is now provided for, seven years after the directive enters into force."
"After the Commission has looked into the matter, it can, of course, decide to re-submit the inclusion of self-employed drivers to the co-decision procedure, especially because the definition of a self-employed worker prevents the creation of new forms of false self-employed drivers."
"I agree that this is a good thing, Mr Hughes, but even so, I still feel that there is something lacking."
"The case of the lorry drivers stuck in Luxembourg - and I would also add, Mr Bolkestein, that they returned home last Friday with their earnings of EUR 1 000 - illustrates the kind of situation that can arise due to a lack of adequate Community legislation."
"As we have seen, there are unscrupulous and fearless transport entrepreneurs who have no hesitation in exploiting the gaps between, on the one hand, national laws and, on the other hand, national and Community legislation, who even go as far as breaking these laws and, most probably, rely on the lack of effective checks."
"Some governments are aware of this situation."
"Therefore, in 1999, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg reached an administrative arrangement known as Eurocontrol Route, designed to improve and strengthen cooperation between the control services."
"But in order to ensure the competition conditions of road transporters are equal in the single market, we firstly need Community legislation, and then the Member States must strictly implement a system for monitoring and imposing fines."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, Mr Bolkestein, I should like to reflect upon the word cowboy."
"I have carried out research into this industry for years, and I do not think that we are dealing with a cowboy society, but rather a cowboy industry."
"It is widely known that this industry is quite unhealthy."
"The rewards in this industry are quite low."
"It is a very fragmented industry with very many drivers operating on a small scale."
"There are also large companies that have gradually turned small drivers into self-employed or pseudo self-employed drivers."
"In short, there is a lot to be done."
"Working hours are being fiddled, and so are collective labour agreements as well as many other things."
"Against this backdrop, we bear a special responsibility, particularly regarding international transport, and we have duly taken this on."
"One of the first things I did, or was allowed to do, when we came here was related to the Willy Betz construction."
"This was a case comparable to Kralowetz, but on a smaller scale."
"The trucks were of very high-quality, people ensured that all kinds of things were satisfactory, except for the work permits and a few other things."
"That led to this drivers' attestation directive."
"Fortunately, we are now in a position where we can welcome a second, very important directive on the organisation of working times."
"In my opinion, more loopholes in the legislation will need to be filled in future."
"Against this background, it is perhaps very good that the information and consultation directive - I should like to use the word historic - be adopted, for the very simple reason that, in the course of time, many large international transport companies have, in fact, been put under a flag of convenience, a process which often did not involve participation."
"They, in fact, turned drivers into self-employed drivers, or contracted them out to small self-employed entrepreneurs."
"There was no participation there either."
"We are now in a position where we can tackle issues of this kind more effectively."
"Mr President, in principle, these are two very important proposals for directives which we are discussing and which are being given very strong support by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Where the directive regarding lorry drivers is concerned, this professional group will therefore be covered by the general legislation that regulates working time."
"This is obviously of significant interest not only to professionals but also to other road users."
"During the conciliation negotiations, there were several occasions on which I specifically emphasised the road safety aspect, which I think is important for those governments which are to administer this legislation in the future."
"It was also important that self-employed people should now be treated in the same way as other drivers for, from the road user' s point of view, it is immaterial whether he is run over by an employed or self-employed driver."
"What is perhaps worrying about this directive is that the transition periods are so long."
"It will in actual fact be, at best, seven years before it is implemented, and we know that, even then, it will subsequently be difficult to track and monitor how the legislation operates in practice."
"The second directive, on information and consultation, is a kind of framework agreement providing a legal basis that is important to workers' being able to demand information and consultation rights."
"We must not, however, forget that - by means, for example, of Paragraphs 25 and 26 of the proposal for a directive, which offer scope for a more or less broad interpretation - it also provides legal opportunities to reject workers' demands in certain cases."
"What is crucial, therefore, to how this directive goes on to operate in practice is how it is received in workplaces and how strong the trade unions are when it comes to pushing those demands to which the directive can give some leverage."
"I believe that this applies generally to this type of legislation."
"We can adopt directives which are sound and well-intentioned in many ways, but when they are then actually put into effect we know that we cannot, in this House, do very much."
"Nor do I believe that the governments of the Member States can do very much."
"I do not share Mrs Smet' s view that systems with tight controls can be designed."
"It is difficult to know what happens out on the roads, especially at night."
"It is difficult to know what goes on behind closed factory gates."
"It is only employees themselves who can do anything about what takes place."
"I therefore want to conclude this speech with a strong appeal to those in the workplace: Do not rely upon the problems' being solved in the European Parliament or the Council, but assume that they have to be solved by yourselves and that you can be helped with them by the legislation that has been enacted in the form of the directive."
"Mr President, let me start by welcoming, on behalf of my group, the compromise achieved in the Conciliation Committee on the framework directive on information and consultation."
"I would like at the same time to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, for leading us to that compromise, which is now very close to the common position."
"We have had quite vigorous discussions in our group on information and consultation, but we agreed that the common position is a really good starting point for a sensible solution."
"Starting with first reading in April 1999, and, indeed, in the committee meetings before that, there were often major differences of opinion between the groups; the rapporteur had to be agile - she was too - and the same was true for me as shadow rapporteur for the largest group, the PPE-DE."
"We have a constructive compromise before us."
"What was possible has now been done."
"What mattered was at last to get a foot in the door, which can then be opened a bit wider by the next blast of wind."
"Second reading stage saw the PPE-DE prevail on many points."
"The majority in my group were opposed to European sanctions but in favour of national ones."
"The conciliation process saw these ideas incorporated in the recitals."
"In its final form, the framework directive primarily contributes to the functioning of the European Works Council."
"All local workers' representatives are given minimum rights helping them to assess the information received from the European Works Council."
"Secondly, it helps mitigate problems with restructuring, which affect national enterprises as well."
"The Works Councils directive, on the other hand, applies only to multi-national enterprises."
"The framework directive prescribes that the procedure be carried out in a spirit of cooperation."
"This means partnership, which, on the one hand, aims at the clear representation of interests, but also, on the other, their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue."
"Information at the right time results in transparency, which itself builds trust and avoids the enterprises sustaining frictional losses - an economic and social gain."
"Both employers and workers gain from this, and do so in the same way."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for their work on two important directives."
"I shall concentrate on the directive concerning information and consultation rights of employees, but I also want to say something about working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities."
"It is very important that self-employed people should now be included, even if there is a transitional period, for we are concerned here with protective legislation for those whose job it is to drive lorries."
"In work of this kind, there is no difference between being employed and being self-employed."
"Just as Mr Schmid says, this is also a road safety issue and, from that point of view, it makes no difference whether the person driving is employed or self-employed."
"Where information and consultation are concerned, I agree with Mrs van den Burg who, in her speech, said that the directive was of historic importance."
"It is of historic importance."
"Three women have been involved."
"I can add a fourth."
"When, in June during the Swedish Presidency, the Council succeeded in reaching a common position, which laid the basis for this directive, a female Swedish minister was also involved."
"I think it quite obvious that there should be this type of information and consultation in an internal market, that an internal market is not only about companies' rights but also employees' rights and that the latter must be informed and be able to put forward their views."
"Sometimes, people in Sweden can be heard saying, 'What does this really mean for Sweden when we, of course, have much better legislation?'"
"Well now, that is true."
"Our legislation is such that this directive does not perhaps affect us at all."
"That being said, minimum directives are still important, not only for those countries which do not have such good legislation but also, indirectly, to prevent an internal market with social dumping arising whereby companies are set up whose employees suffer poor conditions."
"Accordingly, it is important for all the countries that we should increase the minimum levels and have minimum directives that lead to better conditions."
"Finally, I again want to thank the rapporteurs for two good directives."
"I hope that we can go further and improve information and consultation in the future."
"Mr President, the Kralowetz case is to some extent a problem specific to Luxembourg, since governments over the past 20 years have used all sorts of benefits to entice a large number of transport enterprises to Luxembourg, without, though, building up a system to monitor the wages these firms pay and the working conditions they provide."
"Kralowetz is, though, also in essence a European problem."
"It is proof that 'social Europe' does not exist."
"In 1998, the European Union completely liberalised the transport sector, without at the same time providing for the social security regulations it needed."
"Kralowetz and other cases are now showing us the consequences of that."
"The Commission must, in my opinion, do more than what has been talked about this evening."
"There are, in my judgment, three core issues."
"Firstly, the controls must be tightened up."
"What is the use of laws if we do not check that they are obeyed?"
"Secondly, social security documentation must be harmonised across the EU."
"We should not wait until the end of 2003 to do this, but try to get it on track as early as the beginning of that year."
"The third, and probably most important, point is that the ECMT transport licence system, which allows enterprises from outside the EU to drive through the Member States, is today encouraging social dumping and illegality and will still be encouraging them tomorrow if we do not manage to tie these ECMT transport licences to minimum social standards."
"If this is not done, then Karl Kralowetz only needs to travel to Russia tomorrow and he can continue to run his unscrupulous business from there."
"Mr President, European regulation on work times of professional drivers is necessary for three reasons; firstly for the social protection of the workers, secondly to improve the safety of road traffic and thirdly for reasons of competitiveness."
"We take a favourable view of the points achieved in the Conciliation Committee, and are as one with you on the points you have already mentioned, namely the inclusion of the self-employed, a clear definition of self-employment, clearly-defined work times - in respect of which, of course, more redress can again be demanded of enterprises - and the need to define exceptional circumstances as regards weekly work times and work at night."
"My colleagues have already stated that, without controls and sanctions, no directive will achieve any kind of progress."
"I believe that this is where we have to make a start."
"The Commission has presented a new regulation on the harmonisation of certain social security regulations relating to road transport, which will, in consequence, soon be on Parliament's agenda."
"There are, at present, marked discrepancies between the results achieved in the Conciliation Committee and the new proposal, which must be cleared up, and this is something on which coordination is needed."
"This, of course, means that we also have an opportunity to play our part in laying down sanctions and controls in much stronger form, for it is a regulation we are dealing with, and that means it is legally binding and effective in quite another way."
"What is most crucial in my view is that, whilst taking into account the harmonisation of competition, we should put in first place the need to harmonise social security regulations and improve the safety of road transport."
"If we succeed in doing that, we will already have achieved a great deal."
"Mr President, I do not share the enthusiasm of my colleagues for the results of this conciliation but I am equally warm in my congratulations to both rapporteurs."
"They won and I lost, to my regret and possibly their surprise."
"We all know that if the Council had not given in then Parliament itself would have conceded rather than lose either directive."
"So Parliament had a weak hand but both rapporteurs played it extremely well."
"I congratulate them for their skill."
"They were helped by the early climb-down of the UK Government during both conciliation processes."
"It was particularly ironic that the UK Minister for Europe should have come to Strasbourg last autumn - to plead with UK MEPs from all parties to vote down the whole Ghilardotti report - to find that not only were Labour MEPs positively promoting the report but the UK representative then bent over backwards to support it as well."
"Politics is certainly an odd business."
"As colleagues know, I am a fervent supporter of information and consultation but an equally fervent opponent of a one-size-fits-all straitjacket for companies of all shapes and sizes."
"This directive, as amended, is more likely, in my view, to be a barrier to employee involvement than a bridge."
"Moving to the working time directive: in my view this is bad legislation."
"It could have been worse had it limited night-time driving, but I was delighted that the rapporteur finally saw reason and this proposal was removed."
"But it is still bad legislation in its provisional extension to include the self-employed."
"As the Spanish representative said, when joining other countries in registering his country's dissent from the final text, it is the first time that the entrepreneurial sector has been included in any directive."
"I will certainly fight to make sure it is the last."
"We should want to see more jobs, not less."
"This should not and must not be seen as a precedent."
"Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, the situation of the stranded lorry drivers in Luxembourg shows us once again where there is a need for European regulation and monitoring."
"Scarcely ever before has it been made so clear to us what is actually going on in this particular labour market and what is happening to these lorry drivers."
"If ever you talk to European lorry drivers, you will hear how people in that sector work, some of them illegally, and what sort of wages they are paid for doing so; they drive to the point of exhaustion, and not all of them have social security insurance."
"That is the reality of one European labour market, and that is the problem facing us."
"Looked at from this angle, this work time regulation is long overdue - in the interests of our safety on the roads and of the safety of the workers, that is, the drivers themselves."
"I might add that, as has already been mentioned, this case is not only an issue for Luxembourg or about a few Austrian businessmen, we now know that we are dealing with a large number of Austrian businessmen."
"It is also a European phenomenon."
"For me as an out-and-out advocate of European enlargement, the core problem is the way we are doing the dirty on workers from the candidate countries; it is these workers who are bound today by collective contracts to work for derisory wages, and under conditions which are, in social terms, appalling."
"Such is the way this group of workers has entered into our European Union, and that is what we have to take a stand against."
"In any case, though, every cloud has a silver lining."
"In Austria, my country, a group of hauliers' representatives has already taken a stand and spoken out in favour of European regulations tending towards controls and measures that will influence even this ruinous competition."
"That is the situation we face."
"I would add, Commissioner, that you should be prompted by that to think more and better about control systems for workers in the European labour market."
"I would, of course, like to start by congratulating all the rapporteurs."
"Having said that, I would like to point out that the approval of these two directives constitutes an important step within the construction of European labour law and, therefore, in the construction of a social Europe, and all this, furthermore, by means of dialogue and mutual concessions from positions which were initially comprehensible."
"Of course, the inclusion of the self-employed may go against the entrepreneurial spirit, as my country maintained."
"In relation to the general framework for information and consultation, the Chapter IV of the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights, entitled 'Solidarity' , begins with Article 27, which establishes, under the title 'Workers' right to information and consultation within the undertaking' , that 'Workers or their representatives must, at the appropriate levels, be guaranteed information and consultation in good time in the cases and under the conditions provided for by Community law and national laws and practices' ."
"Article 136 of the European Union Treaty already indicated that social dialogue was an objective of the Community and the Member States."
"It therefore seems logical and necessary that, outside other specific directives, such as Directive 94/45/EC, a single directive should establish a general framework which lays down minimum requirements for the exercise of the right to information and consultation in undertakings and workplaces within the Community."
"These rights, previously laid down in the European Social Charter of 1961, and in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, of 1989, are now, as I have said, included in the European Union' s Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It should surprise nobody that workers, via their representatives, should be aware of the situation and development of the undertaking, the decisions which are to be taken and their repercussions and effects for the future, since their existence and, above all, subsistence, are often linked to the undertaking."
"Of course, the content of these rights must be aimed at strengthening the undertaking, increasing employment possibilities and adapting workers to new or revised production processes."
"Nevertheless, experience demonstrates that the mechanisms have not always worked well: workers have become involved late in the process of decision-making, when decisions had already been taken."
"I therefore feel that the content of Article 4 is particularly worth highlighting..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, we have over the last few weeks dealt with a number of matters - including social security measures - with a direct bearing on the transport sector, and those of us in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism were also of the opinion that all these measures - and I do believe that work time, which is now at last regulated, is an important chapter in the course of completion - only make sense if the Member States have the will, on the one hand, to tighten controls and, on the other, to adjust sanctions accordingly."
"I am myself from a frontier region and know perfectly well that the word in the sector is currently that whoever best knows the rules of the individual countries can make the most money."
"The lobby that is active here is neither a lobby for the workers nor a lobby against them - I do not think it has anything to do with Luxembourg's legislation either - nor is it a lobby for or against the employers."
"At the end of the day, both of them are the losers in the Luxembourg situation, and, indeed, we again reminded the Commission of this in the celebrated van Dam report."
"Our concern is not with adding more and more directives and piling up ever more detail; what matters to us is that those countries should be ready to tackle this together, so that employers can charge proper prices without suffering from this dumping that is being organised there and the workers can of course work under proper conditions."
"I declare without equivocation that the lobby that is working against this is in essence a lobby supporting nobody but those who cheat and disregard the rules."
"To come back to the first report, an HGV driver who is also the owner of his own HGV is always on the fringes of legality if he wants to work and earn a decent living."
"That is the situation we are living in."
"This means that we have to consider the developing liberalisation in goods transport by road firstly in economic terms, secondly from the employer's - and also the employee's - standpoint, but always from the same perspective, and I believe we can represent both interests equally."
"Mr President, I want to use the two minutes available to me simply to respond to Mr Bolkestein's statement on the Kralowetz affair."
"What has to be emphasised first in this deplorable business is that it is not Luxembourg's legislation and practices that deserve to be pilloried here, but the way the Kralowetz affair has highlighted social deficits in the European area and the European Union, a sphere in which such things are inexcusable."
"Nor, in the first place, is blame to be laid at the door of the European Commission, but rather at that of the majority of the Member States, who are refusing to agree to common rules on working conditions and respectable wage levels in order to counteract social dumping within the internal market."
"As regards the proposed EU directive on lorry drivers' driving times, it has been the Luxemburgers, of all people, together with the French and the Belgians, who have, in the Transport Affairs Council, worked to include the pseudo self-employed in the directive's scope."
"Despite the praiseworthy efforts as regards the Eurocontrol Route mentioned by Mrs Flesch, it is this nigger that is lurking in the woodpile of the Kralowetz affair."
"We need legislation at Community level that leaves no room for legal grey areas, which are shamelessly exploited by people who - as our Prime Minister trenchantly expressed it - possess a certain criminal energy."
"That is the lesson we must learn, and I hope that the Member States that have hitherto refused to agree to common rules will now cease from obstructing tighter regulation at EU level, so that this modern form of slavery can now be done away with."
"I wish also to emphasise that a reform of the right of establishment in Luxembourg is on its way through the official channels, and will incorporate stricter criteria making it less easy for dodgy firms to get permits and licences to trade in a perfectly legal way, which is in any case not that easy in view of current EU directives on the definition of businesses."
"I hope that the devotees of the complete liberalisation of the transport of goods by road, who have so strongly advocated that cause in this House, and no longer have anything to offer against the practices of entrepreneurs like Kralowetz ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off.)"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my warmest thanks to the House and to the parliamentary delegation in the Conciliation Committee."
"I should in particular like to thank the Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, and, above all, your rapporteur, Mr Hughes, for their excellent work."
"As a result of their efforts, their ability and their determination, it is finally possible to adopt a measure which the Commission proposed more than three years ago - a very successful outcome."
"In adopting this directive, we are making essential progress towards eliminating the competition distortions in the road sector but, above all, towards improving road safety."
"This directive will not only allow the elimination of abuses in that sector but also facilitate a better balance between modes."
"Revitalisation of rail will be possible only with the end of wild competition in road transport."
"It is thus essential for Member States to make the necessary controls in order to ensure that the new legislation should be respected."
"The directive lays down minimum conditions for the organisation of the working time of drivers and also takes into account all the activities which are performed by drivers in addition to driving."
"Thanks to this Parliament, it will ultimately be possible for this directive to cover all drivers of all categories, whether self-employed or not."
"That is a great achievement for road safety because tiredness obviously affects all drivers in the same way, whether they work for a firm or are self-employed."
"Asking the Commission to investigate the effects of exclusion and as a result of its investigations to propose special conditions for the inclusion of self-employed drivers, certainly is the best approach."
"Let me thank you once again for the determination that Members of this Parliament have shown throughout the conciliation procedure, which has enabled us to adopt the directive."
"Also, on the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, I should like to express my congratulations to her and to all Members of this Parliament on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council on this very important directive."
"This agreement was only possible due to the spirit of compromise shown by Parliament and the Council."
"The final draft of the directive, as we see it now, firstly meets completely the initial Commission goals, i.e. to establish and develop throughout the Union good practices of worker information and consultation, focused on anticipating and managing change."
"Secondly, it gives leeway to action from social partners when it comes to implementing the provisions of the directive."
"Thirdly, it is compatible with all national systems and provides for mechanisms allowing for a smooth introduction of the new arrangements in all of them."
"Fourthly, it reflects the views of the two legislators as at least 15 of Parliament's amendments in its two readings have been incorporated into the text."
"Therefore, the draft before us deserves acceptance, certainly from the Commission but also from Parliament and the Council."
"Once adopted, the directive will complete the Community framework in the field of worker information and consultation, a framework which provides European companies and their workers with an essential tool to facilitate change and to ensure that it is carried on in a socially acceptable way."
"The Commission very much hopes that the considerable work done in this field in recent years will now be continued through a positive and proactive attitude from social partners in relation to the consultation documents it presented to them two weeks ago on the social aspects of corporate restructuring."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, presented pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The vote on the motions for resolutions relating to the Commission' s statement will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Energy performance of buildings"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0465/2001) by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the energy performance of buildings (COM(2001) 226 - C5-0203/2001 - 2001/0098(COD))."
"Mr President, this crucial directive stems directly from the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply, which this House has recently debated at length."
"We are obviously all aware that the main component of the Union' s energy bill relates to buildings: ventilation, refrigeration, heating, lighting etc."
"Therefore, anything that is done in this field has a special effect from this point of view."
"Mr President, this framework directive marks the end of the era of expressions of will or recommendations."
"We are entering a new era of decisive commitments, binding actions and a firm will that this type of measure may become a reality."
"I wanted to stress three aspects of the directive."
"The first is the obligation for all buildings in the Union to hold a certificate testifying to their energy efficiency."
"This certificate will certainly be of great value as a signal within the markets and will contribute significantly to energy saving."
"The second is the obligation for all new buildings to incorporate an energy-efficiency study as an essential requirement for planning permission."
"The third aspect is the obligation for all buildings of an area of greater than 1 000 m2 and which are subject to extensive renovation, to undergo an improvement of their energy efficiency."
"There are other actions laid down in the directive, but I wanted to highlight these three because they are clearly the ones with the greatest potential."
"It will not escape you that if - as some studies suggest - it is possible to achieve a saving over the next few years of 20% in the energy bill for buildings, 20% of 40% brings us close to 10% and this, in terms of the oil bill and CO2 emissions, has an importance which is clear to all of us."
"Mr President, this is a good time to thank the other groups in the House for their valuable contribution and for their help in ensuring that Parliament' s amendments improve this important legislative text."
"I would like to thank the Socialist Group and Mrs Zrihen for their numerous contributions and, above all, I would like to stress their interesting suggestion in relation to social housing."
"I would also like to warmly thank the Group of the Greens and Mrs Ahern for showing such interest and cooperation, and also highlight their wonderful contribution in relation to passive cooling techniques, which are so important in those areas of the Union where the climate is very warm and cooling (air conditioning systems) begins to be a determining factor."
"I would also like to thank the Liberal Group for emphasising that tax incentives are always better than penalties."
"We say in Spanish that 'more is gained by licking than by biting' , and this is also true in the economic field."
"Unfortunately, there are two points on which we have not been able to achieve unanimity in the House: firstly, the time limits for application of the directive, where we have opted for a reasonable midpoint between overly extended periods, which would render it ineffective, or overly strict demands, which would make it unviable."
"Secondly, the limit of 1 000 m2, which the Group of the Greens wanted to reduce."
"We understand their intention and we share their concern, but if we really want this directive to be implemented within a time scale which makes it effective, we must accept the figure proposed to us by the Commission."
"Mr President, if it is the case that politics is the art of making the necessary possible, this directive will effectively guarantee that, in a very important chapter of the Union' s energy expenditure, there will over the coming decade be a huge saving which will contribute to the well-being, the progress and the security of all Europeans."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Vidal-Quadras, on his excellent work on this important directive."
"As he has pointed out, the European Union consumes more and more energy and therefore also imports more and more energy products, because our demand outweighs our capacity for supply by means of our own resources."
"It is therefore important firstly to diversify our sources of energy, by seeking new energy sources including, of course, renewable energy and furthermore we need to promote and pursue energy efficiency."
"I hope that Mr Vidal-Quadras has taken a favourable view of the opinion of the Environment Committee, since I believe that the points which we have highlighted within it contribute to enriching some of the aspects of his excellent proposal."
"I believe that a key reference for increasing the Member States' receptiveness to the proposal is that account should be taken of local climatic and special conditions."
"Another point on which the Environment Committee has insisted is the homogenisation of building certificates in the different Member States, which would allow for comparisons of the energy efficiency achieved in each building."
"We also wanted to define those buildings which are excluded from the application of energy-saving measures and, also, in order that our proposal is not rejected, we have proposed, like Mr Vidal-Quadras, that we accept the Commission' s proposal aimed at reducing the area of the buildings affected."
"I am in favour of this approach, Mr Vidal, like my committee, but I also understand your position."
"I believe that we will have to wait and see what the final result is and we will have to respect it."
"The important thing is that the directive should go ahead, Mr Vidal-Quadras."
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca for his usual, very cooperative and consensual approach."
"I know that Mrs Zrihen, our socialist shadow, who unfortunately cannot be here this evening, appreciated the way in which he worked."
"This directive, part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent, should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU, and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment."
"We as socialists are very supportive of the amendments put forward by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and others."
"The rapid growth of air conditioning needs to be taken into account more, the possibilities open to Member States in the form of inducements should be clarified, and many of the definitions need to be tightened."
"One point that Mrs Zrihen wanted to make was that the surface area definitions must be re-examined over the next four years."
"It could well be that this directive is insufficiently ambitious and that it should also apply to much smaller surface areas."
"We ask the Commission to prepare for a reduction if that proves necessary."
"In conclusion, may I once again thank Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca and the Commission."
"We look forward to more directives as promised by the Commissioner in this important area of energy efficiency, of energy intelligence."
"Mr President, I should also like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur for a job well done and for his efforts to obtain consensus, which were not altogether successful in my case, as I continued to insist that we deal with a lower surface area than it was possible to agree on."
"So I have tabled amendments to that effect."
"I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group."
"We live in hope, and perhaps a review is the best way forward, as Mrs McNally indicated."
"Many provisions of this directive have already been envisioned in the SAVE directive in 1993."
"We should now proceed to give it teeth."
"As I said, I would have liked to have seen stronger teeth here, but we need legally binding measures - which I believe we have - which will begin a process of really ensuring that we deal strongly with energy saving in the European Union."
"In practice, the obligation to review is one of the most important requirements in the report, and for that I thank the Members."
"Mr President, I have an interest to declare: I chair the Energy Efficiency Advice Centre which operates in the northern half of the region that I represent."
"I hasten to add that it is a technical interest and not a financial one."
"Improving the energy performance of buildings, however it is defined, is the most difficult issue that I have ever had to grapple with. Therefore my sympathy, to some extent, is with the rapporteur in being presented with an issue of this complexity."
"In the UK we have too many organisations trying to improve matters."
"At the European level we have a certain confusion of objectives."
"Are we trying to save energy?"
"Are we trying to reduce CO2 emissions, or are we trying to reduce energy consumption?"
"These are not all the same things."
"It is energy consumption that we should be focusing on."
"In my experience it is the existing buildings that are the key to our success."
"If you look at the housing sector, the most difficult area is rented accommodation rather than the owner-occupied sector."
"We are a long way from solving that one."
"In general I support the Commission's proposals and the report, but I have some hesitation about Amendment No 15."
"We should be focusing more on the common methodology rather than worrying too much at this stage about minimum standards applying right across the whole of the Community."
"We are really a long way from being able to achieve that."
"I also have some reservations about including a CO2 emission indicator."
"If you take a house, it depends on how much gas is being used or how much electricity."
"Therefore you cannot compare them very easily."
"But it is a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, successful management of energy issues is one of the most important prerequisites for building the sustainable society."
"What we are now discussing is energy efficiency."
"In his report, the rapporteur has done well to highlight a series of measures that will contribute to increased efficiency where energy use is concerned."
"It is important to consider both large and small measures."
"All in all, there is a very great deal to be done when it comes both to greater conservation of resources and to the development of different techniques."
"If the necessary objectives are to be achieved, political initiatives are required that include both legislation and measures that act as a stimulus."
"The whole of society must share responsibility for these efforts."
"That applies both to companies and individuals, both to public and private enterprises and both at European and national and local levels."
"How we solve energy issues will naturally affect our comfort and prosperity, but also our future living environment in the broad sense of the word."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca on his excellent work on the proposed directive concerning the energy performance of buildings."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its thorough and thoughtful discussions and to express my satisfaction with the way in which the debate in Parliament has sharpened the focus of the proposal and strengthened it."
"It will very likely be one of our most important means of meeting the European Union's Kyoto commitment and of improving our security of supply."
"As has been pointed out, the buildings sector accounts for over 40% of all EU final energy consumption."
"It also has a very large cost-effective savings potential."
"This proposal may lead to a significant improvement in the energy performance of buildings by promoting better minimum standards in Member States and in their building codes and by requiring more frequent updating and wider application of these codes."
"Not only would this apply to new buildings but, as has been said this evening, even more importantly to many existing buildings when they undergo major renovations."
"That is where the real potential for improvement lies."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's report and the proposed changes that will serve to improve, clarify and strengthen the proposal."
"Many amendments do this by enhancing the technical and financial definitions, giving concrete examples and defining the proposal's scope and implementation more exactly."
"For example, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 35, 36 and 37 are amendments the Commission can accept, many as they are, some with minor redrafting."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 6 encourage the use of subsidy schemes and incentives to promote the implementation of the proposal, taking into account socio-economic implications, and are thus also acceptable."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 22, on individual metering and billing and authorisation of inspectors respectively, can also be accepted if their financial and legal implications are illuminated more clearly in the text."
"Mr Adam mentioned Amendment No 15."
"That is a comprehensive amendment, parts of which are acceptable to the Commission."
"The setting of efficiency levels at Community level is, however, not yet feasible."
"Amendments Nos 18 and 20 are also acceptable in parts, bearing in mind the need to allow CO2 indicators to remain optional."
"Amendments Nos 1, 12, 13, 16, 17, 21 and 27 are not acceptable to the Commission for technical and definitional reasons, including the degree of detail or because of related problems of subsidiarity that would result for example from the setting of efficiency levels at Community level."
"Because of the heterogeneous nature of the building sector as a result of differences in climate, culture and building traditions, subsidiarity and flexibility for Member States are important in the implementation of this directive."
"The Commission feels that the most effective way to improve energy performance requirements in Member States is to provide methods to encourage them to improve their own building codes, set their own performance levels and ensure full application and regular revision of those."
"While methods of calculation, many norms and a number of standards can be established at Community level, the actual efficiency level of energy performance of buildings should remain a Member State matter."
"Most of the amendments proposed take these principles into account."
"Another important point is with regard to the threshold for upgrading the energy performance of existing buildings when they undergo major renovation."
"Upgrading existing buildings is an important part of this proposal."
"For many Member States it represents a new area of endeavour which will require new performance standards, new resources and substantial investment."
"We feel that the proposed threshold of 1 000 m2 for upgrading is therefore the best possible compromise attainable at this early stage."
"Finally, as regards the period for transposition of this directive we feel that it is important to underline that we should avoid an unnecessarily long period if we are to meet the target date for Kyoto which is usually set at between 2008 and 2012."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon.."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.50 p.m.)"
"Announcement by the President"
"At the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 31 January 2002 it was decided to alter the duration of the adjournment of the session."
"I should like to inform you that pursuant to Rule 10(4) a plenary sitting will be held in Brussels on Wednesday, 20 March 2002."
"The purpose of that sitting will be to hear the outcome of the Barcelona Summit meeting."
"It will be addressed by the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar."
"EIB Annual Report for 2000"
"The next item is the report (A5-0392/2001) by Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the EIB Annual Report for 2000 (C5-0541/2001 - 2001/2218(COS))."
"Mr President, Mr Maystadt, I should like to thank you, Mr Maystadt, very much for the kindness and readiness to help which you and your colleagues have shown to me and the committee."
"It made the work considerably easier."
"I also wish to thank my colleagues."
"The role of the EIB has been of topical interest in the debate in recent years, and criticisms have been made."
"These have mainly been targeted at deficiencies when it comes to environmental issues, openness and transparency."
"The EIB has understood the criticism, and significant changes have taken place."
"For this, you, Mr Maystadt, and your colleagues deserve our recognition."
"The analysis for the year is in many respects a follow-up to the sterling work carried out a year ago by Mr Lipietz."
"A number of the views put forward at that time are being repeated now."
"As is well known, the most important issue for the EU is enlargement."
"This involves a fundamental change constituting a major challenge both for the candidate countries and the current Member States."
"Today, most EIB loans go to different types of regional development project within the EU."
"That is certainly fully compatible with Statutes of the EIB, but future enlargement makes it necessary to reconsider this distribution of resources."
"There must be an increase in the future Member States' share of the total loans."
"Solidarity on the part of the EU must also, of course, extend to include third countries that until now have been recipients of EIB loans."
"Among these are the Balkan countries, the Mediterranean countries and the ACP countries."
"Now it is also Russia' s turn."
"There is also a need for discussion concerning which less developed countries the EIB is mandated by the Council to support and concerning whether, for example, the 49 least developed countries are not in fact in greater need than the ACP countries traditionally supported by the EU."
"In the information society, economic growth and an improved standard of living are not only the results of constructing new roads and factories, but also of education, innovation, new technology, e-commerce and the development of other knowledge-intensive sectors."
"In my view, this has to be reflected to a greater extent in the EIB' s activities."
"It is important that the EIB should continue to strengthen its support for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There are clear opportunities for growth in this area."
"The EIB needs to become more active in making SMEs more aware of the possibilities that already exist for granting such loans."
"From having been a rather closed institution, the EIB has begun to change its attitude to information and transparency."
"Contact with democratically elected representatives at local and regional levels is important."
"There is a knowledge of the projects at local level."
"Contact with non-governmental organisations has improved, and the bank' s web site has also improved."
"The EIB has published a list of projects at the assessment stage."
"In my opinion, it would be good if all the public documents from the internal evaluation unit were published on the Net."
"As matters stand, the EIB is supervised by its Board of Governors, that is to say by the 15 Finance Ministers, but it lacks prudential supervision by a competent authority."
"The committee has discussed the possibility of letting the European Central Bank, or ECB, exercise supervision over the EIB because the EC Treaty provides for the Council to give the ECB specific tasks of prudential supervision."
"If the Council does not want to give the ECB this remit, the issue should be clarified at the next Intergovernmental Conference, with the objective of establishing proper prudential supervision of the EIB' s activities."
"In order to improve the way in which the Bank fulfils its obligation to render accounts, the committee proposes that the external Auditors' Committee forward its findings to the European Parliament, as well as to the EIB' s Board of Governors."
"Mention might be made of the fact that the EIB has already shown a willingness to cooperate more closely with OLAF."
"The environment is the issue which the NGOs are most interested in."
"These issues received much attention in the Lipietz report last year."
"I believe that the EIB has become more aware of environmental issues and that the Bank' s support for environmental projects has increased considerably."
"Another key factor is the EIB' s environmental assessment capacity."
"At present, the EIB has only one person responsible for coordinating environmental issues, while the project teams are composed of engineers and economists who have received additional environmental training."
"In my opinion, more staff are required in this area."
"More trained environmental experts should be appointed or contracted to review the environmental impact assessments correctly."
"There are, therefore, many demands upon the European Investment Bank."
"If all of these needs are to be met, it is necessary to increase the capital of the Bank."
"In line with what applies to commercial banks able to handle greater risks, the Member States should, for example, consider reviewing the ratio of capital borrowed by the Bank to capital of its own, with the purpose of including the EIB' s reserves."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House."
"Finally, I want to comment on the amendments that have come in."
"I am able to support Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 from Mr Lipietz etc."
"They do not change the content of the report but highlight the environmental issues and the issues concerning openness and transparency."
"I cannot, however, support Amendment No 2, which I find unnecessarily far-reaching."
"I am only able to support Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish colleague Olle Schmidt, for a very good report."
"It sheds light upon the important areas of Europe' s future development, which the EIB has a major responsibility for promoting within the framework of its powers."
"The report also addresses the demands Parliament should make upon the EIB as Europe' s financing institution."
"I therefore want to confine myself to highlighting a few more of those aspects I consider to be most significant."
"I am thinking of the candidate countries, the way in which projects are prioritised, small and medium-sized enterprises and supervision of the EIB."
"Where the candidate countries are concerned, it is extremely important that there should be a significant increase in their share of the total loans of EUR 36 billion."
"In 2000, they had access to EUR 2.9 billion."
"In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the European family, there must be an increase if it is to be possible to achieve the objective set at the Lisbon Summit."
"When it comes to prioritising projects, it is important to safeguard Europe' s competitiveness and therefore prioritise infrastructure in the broad sense of the word."
"That applies, then, to communication not only in the traditional sense of roads, connecting links and the availability of energy-efficient transport systems for goods and people, but also in the sense of telecommunications, IT, e-commerce, education, increased knowledge and support for new technology."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises at present account for more than 60 per cent of EU jobs."
"In an enlarged EU, they will probably account for a significantly higher percentage."
"Of the 18 million companies in the EU, 99% are small and medium-sized enterprises employing 66% of the workforce."
"More than 90% of these companies have fewer than ten employees."
"If, like many new companies, the existing small and medium-sized enterprises are to be given the opportunity to grow and become larger, or simply become large companies, more must be done in terms of supplying information, contributing to projects and providing access to venture capital."
"The rapporteur has proposed that the Commission be called upon to give the ECB powers to exercise supervision over the EIB."
"I agree with that."
"The Bank has no national connection and cannot therefore be compared with a private commercial bank."
"The ECB is therefore a suitable supervisory body until such time as a possible European finance inspectorate is established."
"In view of the objective set by the Lisbon Summit, priority must be given to those projects which lead to economic growth, development and increased employment in an enlarged Europe and which attach major importance to small and medium-sized enterprises' opportunities for growth."
"Competitiveness and staying power should be the guiding principles here."
"Greater demands must be made upon the EIB in terms of providing information and evaluating projects and the importance of proper professional supervision and auditing must be emphasised."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend a warm welcome to the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt."
"In February last year, I expressed the hope of turning the discussion of the annual report in this Parliament into an annual tradition, and this is what we are honouring now."
"It has taken a while before the report could be included on the agenda - indeed, it was already completed in November - but it is good to uphold this tradition."
"Moreover, I understand that, this coming Thursday, you also intend to present the plans for the future and the 2001 annual report to the press and the Council."
"Last year, we met immediately after this presentation, whereas this year, our meeting immediately precedes it, and I hope that you will be able to lift the veil and give us some information about these plans for the future."
"Before I deal with the content, I should also like to thank Mr Schmidt for his report and for the sound cooperation during the handling of the amendments tabled by us and other groups."
"In my opinion, it has been a productive group effort."
"I should now like to turn to a number of points which were also raised in our annual report last year, and note with satisfaction that you have indeed devoted attention to these in your further plans, and that Parliament' s areas of concern indeed recur in the Corporate Operational Plan which you presented this year."
"I should like to comment on a few of these areas of concern."
"I will skim over other points, because these have already been dealt with by others."
"I trust that the environment will be dealt with adequately by the Greens and others."
"Needless to say, we support this, as well as the tabled amendments, although, like Mr Schmidt, we are loathe to replace Paragraph 30 which concerns the balance between the environment and other objectives."
"In other words, we do want to maintain this balance and only accept the amendment in question as a supplement."
"Transparency and evaluations have also already been commented on, and the subject of SMEs has already been raised by Mrs Grönfeldt."
"I should, however, like to touch upon the matter of supervision."
"Last year, this was the subject of an extensive debate here, and you noticed that we made it very clear this year in the report that it is desirable for the European Central Bank to play a role in this supervision."
"You have probably seen the Financial Times of 29 January and ascertained that this is now also very much being considered in ECB circles."
"This was evidently raised during a lunch meeting with the Chairman of the FSA, the British financial authority, and I remember that we, too, raised the point during a lunchtime meeting with Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues in the past."
"It is my impression that, although the Bank is amenable to the idea, it is quite reticent because it is not equipped for this at the moment."
"I would call for a somewhat broader discussion to be held about this financial supervision in this Parliament, but also in the Council and in the Commission, for I have the impression that this topic is being dealt with in different reports in a very fragmented manner."
"It is important to sketch the broad outlines in this matter too."
"Perhaps we could do this in a more coherent discussion some time in the future."
"As far as the EIB is concerned, it is not so much about supervision of the latter' s conduct."
"A number of arrangements have been made on this score and this supervision is also being exercised in a number of areas."
"It is mainly about the economic supervision of companies."
"The advantage of that could be that, by means of the financial resources available within the Bank, and also with the available reserves, more could be done and more risk-bearing action could be taken than is currently the case, provided that sound supervision is in place."
"I would now like to turn to another topic which, with a view to the future, will become an important point of discussion, namely that of increasing the Bank' s capital."
"I assume that the supervisors, the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs, will be talking about this during the forthcoming meeting in June."
"You have seen that, in Paragraph 33, we declare our support for such a capital increase."
"This matter should be brought to a conclusion from 2003, and should particularly play a role in enlargement."
"The point of departure in this is - this is actually a comment I should like to make - that it should add value to EIB loans."
"The EIB should not do what is also possible within the market, and I believe that it is important that it act in a transparent manner."
"Unfortunately, I am unable to make any of my other comments, but I shall do so in due course."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Maystadt, President of the European Investment Bank."
"My colleague, Olle Schmidt, the rapporteur, has already expressed the opinion of the Committee on Economic Affairs on the annual report of the EIB and has presented proposals which, according to our committee, would improve its operation and also meet the need to provide it with greater resources to fulfil its commitments."
"I would like to draw your attention to a very specific and topical point."
"In Laeken it was agreed that the EIB would carry out a study to create a financial instrument or institution which would guarantee that, in terms of the cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean, the level of use of resources responds to the effectiveness and possibilities for development cooperation that the situation demands."
"We know that in the Mediterranean, in the medium term, very serious conflicts may arise with the European Union itself, and that in order to ensure our own peace and stability in the future it is necessary to strengthen this cooperation and ensure better application of resources which, according to the experience of the first MEDA programme, has only been 30%."
"Therefore, this initiative agreed at Laeken, of presenting a proposal or alternatives to increase the level of application, seems to us absolutely essential and urgent."
"Also, if this could be consolidated at the next meeting of the Special Council of Barcelona, we believe that it would be even more appropriate, because the whole issue of development cooperation with the Mediterranean was born in 1995 in Barcelona, under the Spanish Presidency."
"The current Presidency of the Council has also considered the issue of cooperation with the Mediterranean to be an urgent priority and we decisively support this initiative."
"Mr President, as Mr Schmidt also pointed out, the initiative leading to Parliament' s resolution on the European Investment Bank' s annual report was taken by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, with Mr Lipietz as the original rapporteur."
"I think it necessary for the European Parliament to express an opinion about the EIB' s activities because the EIB is not only a Bank but also an EU institution that finances large projects and uses Community funds to steer development."
"The EIB has been criticised for neglecting environmental issues, as well as the issues of openness and transparency."
"Mr Schmidt also mentioned that positive changes to the EIB' s policy have taken place recently in response to the criticism."
"I hope that the EIB will continue in the same spirit."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report that addresses important issues."
"It proposes, for example, that loans to the candidate countries should be increased and that evaluations should be made more easily accessible to the general public."
"A further proposal is that dialogue between the two sides of industry, politicians and non-governmental organisations etc. should be strengthened as aspects of openness and transparency."
"The report could, however, have been more vigorous when it comes to environmental issues."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled six amendments that specifically address environmental issues and matters of transparency."
"A prerequisite for expressing our support for an increase in the EIB' s capital should be that the projects lead to sustainable development."
"Performance indicators must also be established so that the EIB' s activities can be measured and evaluated properly."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur expressed his support for most of our amendments."
"In accordance with Mr Schmidt' s wishes, I also accept Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30."
"It would, however, be unfortunate if Amendment No 2 were not to be adopted."
"If civil society is to be able to keep track of an issue, the documents must obviously be available in the national language."
"I call upon MEPs to vote in favour of this amendment."
"Mr President, the European Investment Bank may be said to be one of the European Union' s unknown powers that be."
"With loans amounting to EUR 36 billion granted in the year 2000 and total capital of EUR 100 billion, it exercises significant influence through its policy."
"In spite of its influence, there has been very little discussion of the Bank."
"This is the second year that we are discussing the annual report in Parliament."
"What is perhaps most remarkable of all, however, is how little all this is discussed by the Bank' s owners, in the Member States and in the parliaments of the various Member States which, I believe, are in many cases quite unaware of the Bank' s activities."
"This situation may be compared with that in relation to the World Bank, which has been exposed to extensive examination and debate, or with that regarding the European Development Bank which has also been examined in a different way to the European Investment Bank."
"A good deal of criticism has been directed against the EIB' s activities and in two areas in particular."
"First of all, the EIB has been criticised for having supported a series of projects that have increased environmental problems, as well as for shortcomings in terms of environmental impact assessments."
"Secondly, the EIB has been criticised for a lack of openness and of willingness to engage in dialogue with, for example, environmental movements in different countries."
"I think that this criticism has been justified."
"Comparisons show, for example, that the World Bank is in actual fact significantly better than the European Investment Bank at providing environmental impact assessments and at publicising these."
"It is rare for the Left to have occasion to praise the World Bank, but it does in this case."
"For some years now, the European Investment Bank has shown a new attitude to greater openness, which is very welcome."
"What is important, however, is that this new positive attitude also be followed up by practical measures."
"Mr Schmidt' s report addresses certain demands for measures with which I agree, referring, for example, to the need for more resources, including more staff working on environmental issues and the question of greater openness."
"There is a need to go further, however."
"I believe, for example, that it is reasonable to demand that, if environmental impact assessments are carried out, they should always be published before decisions are taken."
"The EU' s demand for environmental impact assessments must also be fulfilled when loans are granted to projects outside the European Union, and these assessments must be available in translation in the national languages of the countries to which the loans are granted."
"The European Investment Bank should also comply with the Århus Convention, entailing an obligation of great openness towards the environmental movement. This should mean a big improvement."
"The EIB should also have a more evolved policy when it comes to development issues, for example, development in the Developing World as the Bank' s activities there increase."
"The Gothenburg Summit gave the EIB the task of supporting sustainable development and concentrating on climate issues."
"This should have far-reaching consequences for the type of transport and energy projects that can be supported."
"It should imply, hopefully in practice too, a change of focus for the Bank."
"I believe that increasing the Bank' s capital must be conditional upon reforms being carried out."
"Only if the Bank is obliged to implement such reforms should it be agreed to increase the capital."
"I am opposed to the idea of allowing the European Central Bank to act as a supervisory authority."
"The European Central Bank is a genuinely undemocratic institution which should not be given tasks of this kind."
"Mr President, it is right and proper that we should keep on highlighting the significance of SMEs for the European economy."
"SMEs ensure growth and employment in Europe."
"It is therefore right, and indeed important in terms of Europe's development, that the EIB should step up its support for SMEs or carry on with it."
"Half of the total lent, about EUR 5.7 billion, was used for that purpose in 2000."
"This amount should be increased or its continued availability ensured."
"We must not stop the support measures."
"It is also important that more risk capital should be made available to these enterprises, and this is something which I personally strongly support."
"It goes without saying that the points of criticism made in the report must be taken seriously."
"It is not acceptable for the EIB's own home page to list its activities in only two or three languages."
"By so doing, the EIB is limiting its own significance."
"Mr President, Mr Maystadt, the Lisbon Process cannot be imagined without the European Investment Bank."
"Support for SMEs and for entrepreneurship as sources of employment is becoming more important, as external finance other than through banks is becoming more expensive and bank finance for small and medium-sized enterprises is becoming more and more problematic."
"When we consider what the European Investment Bank has achieved since 1968, in terms both of funds and of initial support for projects, I consider the outcome to be an impressive one."
"I must say that the integration of the EIF and the EIB under one roof, which was pushed through by the Lisbon Process, has resulted in an optimisation of the European Investment Bank's activities right across the board."
"I would therefore ask those who now want to push for the founding of another bank, to rely on, and make use of, the competence and qualified expert staff that the European Investment Bank has at its disposal."
"It is for that reason that I oppose the founding of another bank."
"It would surely also be in the interests of the Central and Eastern European States for the work of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and that of the European Investment Bank to be more efficiently harmonised and coordinated with each other."
"I am therefore sure that both the European Investment Bank's quality and its financial activity will be improved still further, or advanced, at the European Summit in Madrid, due, among other things, to the European Commission's consolidated report."
"As has been pointed out by my fellow Members and also in Mr Schmidt's report, one must surely see to it that the best possible use is made of funds for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It will, without doubt, be a matter for our concern that there may be a decreasing number of small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions available with which the European Investment Bank can manage the flow of its funds."
"So it is, of course, very encouraging that the European Investment Bank has a network of 130 active intermediaries and that activity in Italy has now resumed to an encouraging extent."
"We should bear in mind, though, that what matters, above all, is that small and medium-sized enterprises should really be enabled to get access to working capital and also risk-capital financing at their local level."
"It is therefore important, Mr Maystadt, that an assessment should be submitted of what influence this activity by the European Investment Bank has actually had on growth and employment at local and regional level."
"Regional development is, after all, one of its main fields of activity."
"We know that the whole European Union benefits if economic and social cohesion can be realised at regional level."
"So this assessment must be carried out, as should in future be done, before the Spring Summits, so that even better use may be made of the European Investment Bank's instruments."
"One final plea, Mr President."
"All the institutions are committed to the need for gender mainstreaming."
"I have noted that progress has been made in appointments to the European Investment Bank."
"There is so far, unfortunately, only one woman on its board, and so the Member States are urged to give women, too, the facilities and opportunities to play their part in the Investment Bank's work."
"I also note that, at its highest level of management, only one of the twelve officials is a woman."
"There must be changes here."
"Mr President, I will make a few quick comments which have occurred to me during the debate."
"Firstly, I would like to thank Parliament for taking the initiative of holding a debate on the annual activities of the European Investment Bank."
"You know, and some of you have highlighted, the important role the Bank plays in the channelling of savings towards investment in key sectors of the European Union as well as sectors outside it."
"You have highlighted the Bank' s fundamental objective of contributing to our aims in close cooperation with the Commission."
"The Bank has already implemented the Lisbon initiatives."
"Initiative 2000 is fully operational and continues to increase its actions in the funding of small and medium-sized businesses."
"President Maystadt will make some subsequent comments, but I would like to congratulate the Bank on the good work it is doing in this particular sector and, above all, on the transformation which has taken place as a result of paying greater attention to risk capital."
"In this respect, the European Investment Fund is turning risk capital into an important Community institution as a complement to the market forces which govern supply and demand."
"Some of you have suggested that the Bank should pay greater attention to environmental factors."
"I believe that we must be aware that each institution has its own function and the function of the Bank is basically financial."
"Environmental issues are fundamental, of course, but each institution must play its corresponding role."
"I would like to make two further comments."
"The first relates to the extension of the Bank to other areas."
"I believe that this issue is mentioned in the seventh point of the report."
"Nevertheless, we must not forget the extension of the Bank' s actions over recent years."
"We only need to remember that, in 2000, Croatia was included in the CCEE contribution and the special option for the Customs Union with Turkey, and that in November 2001 the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was included."
"Some of you have expressed your concern with regard to the careful monitoring of the Bank' s activities."
"It is true that the statutes of the European Central Bank open up this possibility, but it is also true that it has no authority whatsoever."
"Even if it had it, we would have to raise the question of whether the idea of monitoring the European Investment Bank is consistent."
"The European Investment Bank is not a commercial bank. It is a multilateral bank which belongs to the Member States and has been established as a Community institution by the Treaty."
"Therefore, in my opinion, it is doubtful whether it is correct to have additional monitoring of one Community institution by another Community institution."
"Above all, bearing in mind that we now have a clear system for controlling the Bank by means of the auditing that is being carried out, which directly informs the Council and the government and is attended by external auditors."
"Furthermore, you also know that the Court of Auditors already carries out inspections of its activities when they involve European Union funding."
"Therefore, I believe that this issue warrants more profound analysis."
"We do not believe that we should create other monitoring posts or institutions."
"Finally, with regard to the issue of Barcelona and the possibility of funding cooperation with the Mediterranean, raised by Mr Gasòliba, President Maystadt will comment on the actions of the European Investment Bank."
"I will simply say that the Commission is working on the Laeken mandate in order to have a report as soon as possible."
"We would all have liked it to have been finished for Barcelona, but, naturally, we will have to follow the normal procedures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say what an honour it is for me to have another opportunity to answer the questions raised by the House, as Mrs van den Burg wished; this could become an annual tradition."
"Although the European Investment Bank has no formal obligation to report to the European Parliament, I think that it is natural, in a democracy, for all public institutions, including the financial institutions, to have to respond to questions and to take into account the priorities expressed by the representatives elected by the citizens."
"It is therefore a great pleasure for me to attempt to answer the questions that have been raised, bearing in mind that five minutes does not, of course, give me enough time to provide a detailed answer."
"We will, however, have the opportunity to continue the dialogue, particularly within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, under the dynamic chairmanship of Mrs Randzio-Plath and on the basis of the excellent report by Mr Olle Schmidt."
"Today, I would simply like to give some details in response to the four categories of questions raised."
"The first category contains questions on the activities of the EIB; the second relates to questions on supervision; the third category regards questions on the policy regarding information and transparency and, as for the fourth and final category, I will speak briefly about equal opportunities, an area that is particularly close to Mrs Randzio-Plath' s heart."
"First of all, as far as the EIB' s activities are concerned, Mrs Randzio-Plath quite rightly pointed out that regional development was still the main task of the European Investment Bank."
"In conjunction with Commissioner Barnier' s services, we developed a set of indicators and we are attempting to assess, in a more systematic manner, the impact of projects that we finance on regional development."
"The growing importance of the EIB' s activities in the candidate countries has also been mentioned and Mr Schmidt quite rightly emphasised this point."
"Enlargement is a huge challenge for us all, for those who are already in the European Union and for those who are about to join it."
"Clearly, the European Investment Bank must step up its work in these countries to assist them in fulfilling the conditions of membership as quickly as possible."
"Currently, the EIB already has a portfolio in excess of EUR 16 billion, so far mainly for infrastructures - such as transport, communication and energy infrastructures - but also for the environment and these funds are increasingly being granted directly to promoting the private sector."
"The environment is another area on which the rapporteur and other speakers have focused in particular, and I think that it must be approached from two angles."
"The first angle is that of the number of environmental projects that we finance; these are projects which play a direct part in protecting or improving the environment."
"I can now give you - before anyone else hears them - the figures that I will be publishing next Thursday."
"Last year, we granted EUR 6 billion to environmental projects in the form of individual loans and EUR 2 billion through what we call global loans, in other words, loans to intermediaries, which themselves provide loans to local authorities."
"This therefore amounted to EUR 6 billion for environmental projects in the European Union and EUR 0.5 billion in candidate countries, which means that, currently, approximately one fifth of our loans go directly towards improving the environment."
"We hope to gradually bring this figure up to a quarter of the total volume of our loans."
"This is the first angle, but there is obviously a second angle - and your Committee has quite rightly paid this a great deal of attention - which is that the other projects, those that are not directly aimed at improving the environment, must also take into account the impact they have on the environment."
"We must therefore put in place the resources to enable us to assess more systematically the environmental impact of these projects. This is the reason why, following a suggestion made in last year' s report by Mr Lipietz, we carried out internal restructuring and set up an environmental group within the project department, whose specific task is to ensure that proper account is taken of environmental aspects when assessing such projects."
"And we, of course, intend to further improve our resources dedicated to this task."
"To continue on the subject of the EIB' s activities, we must mention the Mediterranean."
"Without going into too much detail, I would simply like to say that we have taken note of the objectives announced by the Spanish Presidency and that the EIB is at the Council and Commission' s disposal, if it is felt, given the extent of our activities in the Mediterranean, that the EIB can help to achieve these objectives."
"Lastly, I note the concern expressed by several of you, particularly Mr Schmidt and Mrs Randzio-Plath, regarding the support given to small- and medium-sized businesses."
"We are continuing to provide this support, not only through global loans but also through the European Investment Fund, which last year gave risk capital of EUR 800 million to small- and medium-sized businesses."
"With regard to supervision, we should bear in mind, as Commissioner Solbes stressed, that the EIB is already supervised in various ways."
"I would simply say that we are working to apply the prudential banking rules."
"If it were considered advantageous to organise additional supervision by a body that is specialised in banking supervision, the EIB would, of course, have no objection."
"We would welcome an external authority specialised in banking supervision checking that we are correctly applying the prudential rules."
"As for the policy regarding information and transparency; first, we now publish all our strategy documents; second, we publish an overview of our assessment methods; third, we publish, with a few exceptions, the list of all the projects currently being examined so that the public can respond and submit its comments; last, we now publish all the full assessment reports carried out by the independent ex-post evaluation department, which was set up a few years ago."
"I should like to end by briefly touching upon the subject of equal opportunities."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath has, on several occasions, drawn our attention to an undeniable imbalance within the Bank' s higher management."
"There is still only one woman on the Management Committee."
"I regret this, but it depends on Member States."
"As far as the management itself is concerned, we decided last year to appoint four women to senior management level, which will therefore begin to correct this imbalance."
"To sum up, Mr President, we are determined to ensure that the EIB remains an institution that serves the European Union, something which requires, by necessity, greater cooperation with the Commission and strengthening dialogue with Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at noon."
"Financial services legislation"
"The next item is the report (A5-0011/2002) by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the implementation of financial services legislation (2001/2247(INI))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be responding on behalf of the European Commission to Mr von Wogau' s report on the implementation of financial services legislation, in the context of the Lamfalussy report."
"I would like to start by congratulating Mr von Wogau and thanking him for all his impressive efforts to build consensus on this important matter in this House."
"Let me also congratulate Mrs Randzio-Plath, who chairs the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and who has helped to stimulate the Commission' s thinking on these matters."
"Implementing the proposals contained in the Lamfalussy report in a fair and balanced way is of major importance to the European Union."
"It lays down essential stages for delivering the entire Financial Services Action Plan by 2005, as requested by the Lisbon European Council, and the measures relating to the securities markets by 2003, as requested by the Stockholm European Council."
"The aim is, of course, to build a strong, stable, pan-European capital market, a market which will benefit its citizens and businesses by improving future employment and growth prospects throughout Europe."
"We have reached a fair and honourable compromise. Let us, together, seize the moment."
"I am confident that our debate today will yield a positive result and send out a strong signal of the renewed and effective cooperation between Commission, Council and Parliament."
"Before making a formal statement on behalf of the Commission, I should first like to dispel any possible doubts by stating that the Commission will act both on this statement and on the Stockholm European Council resolution and what is set out in the letter of 2 October 2001 from Commissioner Bolkestein to Mrs Randzio-Plath, Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I should also like to draw your attention to three vitally important points."
"Firstly, the Commission will naturally respect Parliament' s powers of codecision and the rights to information and transparency which underpin our democratic process."
"The Commission will do business with Parliament and the Council on a joint basis, fully respecting the current interinstitutional balance."
"Secondly, the Commission will, without exception, take full account of the European Parliament' s position, as is provided for in the Stockholm European Council resolution."
"It will do everything in its power to find appropriate solutions in keeping with the current interinstitutional balance."
"Thirdly, with a view to the longer term and the revision of the Treaties, the Commission wishes to see Article 202 amended and both its own future executive duties and the joint role of the two co-legislators clarified."
"This concludes my preliminary remarks. I shall now make a formal statement on behalf of the European Commission:"
"""As was recalled at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, the integration of financial services markets is fundamental to strengthening the European economy."
"The delivery of the Financial Services Action Plan by the deadlines set by the European Council conclusions - 2005 for the entire Action Plan and 2003 for the measures relating to securities markets - is crucial to achieving this objective."
"Ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which will take stock of the European Union' s economic reform process as mapped out in Lisbon, the Commission welcomes the close cooperation between the Community institutions and expresses confidence in its harmonious development when it comes to implementing the Commission' s proposals, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Wise Men chaired by Baron Lamfalussy."
"The Commission stated in its White Paper on European Governance that, in general, its executive responsibilities need to be more clearly defined and that the Council and the European Parliament should have an equal role in controlling the way in which the Commission carries out its executive role."
"In the White Paper, it also announced its intention of launching a debate on this issue in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and indicated that it favours an amendment to Article 202 of the EC Treaty."
"In the meantime, before the next revision of the Treaty and without setting a precedent, flexible regulatory mechanisms in the field of financial services are needed that fully respect the institutional balance."
"In this regard, a letter was sent on 2 October 2001 by the responsible Commissioner to the chair of Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"In this context, the Commission is now in a position:"
"to take note of Parliament' s intention to limit the duration of the delegation of executive powers to the Commission to four years from the entry into force of each particular directive, subject to an extension being proposed by the Commission and accepted by Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission could accept amendments adopted by Parliament to this end;"
"to ensure that Parliament is given a period of three months from the first transmission of draft implementing measures in which to examine them and to give its opinion. However, in urgent cases that are duly substantiated, this period may be shortened;"
"to ensure full transparency vis-à-vis Parliament throughout the entire procedure for the adoption of implementing measures. The Commission will also ensure that there is wide public consultation before draft implementing measures are drawn up;"
"to support Parliament' s wish to see the establishment of a market participants group attached to the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and it strongly encourages its establishment in as short a time as possible;"
"to recall its political willingness to endeavour to ensure that Parliament benefits from equivalent treatment and, in order to secure effective cooperation between the institutions, reaffirms its commitment to take the utmost account of Parliament' s position and any resolutions that it might adopt with regard to implementing measures exceeding the implementing powers provided for in the basic instrument and the Commission' s aim of reaching a balanced solution in such cases."""
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will firmly support the approach that I have outlined. It is the fruit of a lengthy debate and very close cooperation between Commission and Parliament."
"Indeed, with this approach, we can now take another major step forward towards European financial integration, which is the next crucial step after the introduction of the euro."
"Today' s positive result makes it even more essential for work to start in the interinstitutional working party to which Prime Minister Aznar, no less, pledged his authoritative support before this House during the January part-session."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is an extraordinarily important debate that we are taking part in today."
"It is important to banks, insurance companies and investment funds, because this debate will make it clear that we are pressing onward - and that without delay - on the road that leads to a common European market in financial services."
"The debate is though, also important to the European Union's citizens, as we are removing obstacles from the path of cross-border competition in the field of financial services, in the granting of credits and the negotiation of insurance policies."
"Competition of this sort will put the citizen in a stronger position and enhance Europe's competitiveness."
"What, then, is this debate about?"
"Alexandre Lamfalussy and his Committee of Wise Men have made proposals as to how we can speed up the great legislative package needed to make this common market in financial services a reality."
"In doing so, he made the wise suggestion that the legislator, that is Parliament and the Council, should focus on setting the essential objectives, whilst leaving to the Commission, working together with experts, the small print of the implementation provisions."
"That proposal is a very good one."
"Where, then, is the problem?"
"The problem is that we have always found, in our experience as parliamentarians, that it is to us that the public and firms come with complaints about the European Union's bureaucracy, and that they are not complaining about the law, be it a directive or a regulation, that we have helped to enact, but about the provisions made for its implementation."
"That is why Parliament has insisted on being able, jointly with the Council, to carry out a kind of final check on whether the implementation provisions that are enacted actually correspond to what the legislator intended."
"What have our negotiations with the Commission and the Council now achieved?"
"At this point, let me warmly thank President Prodi for his statement, but also Commissioner Bolkestein, Mr John Mogg and many others, as well as the secretariat of the Constitutional Committee."
"I have to tell you that the discussions lawyers had in this area occasionally reminded me of disputations in ancient Byzantium on the sex of angels."
"I wish to thank very warmly all those who helped me find my way judiciously through this labyrinth."
"What have we achieved?"
"Transparency first of all."
"That is important, as we are informed about everything that goes on in the Commission."
"We also get to see preliminary drafts."
"Secondly, we have achieved the reduction of the mandate to four years, after which period it must be renewed by Parliament and the Council."
"We have, furthermore, gained the right to monitor outcomes, which is where President Prodi's statement was extraordinarily important."
"Like the Council, we have three months in which to do this, in which respect we are given equivalence with them."
"President Prodi, indeed, spoke of parity and equivalence, which adds up to an additional safeguard."
"Thirdly, we must be clear in our own minds about the actual relations between the powers."
"We are faced with a large number of legislative acts, which have to be adopted."
"Each time, Parliament and the Council together must give the Commission a mandate, and if the Commission were to fail to take Parliament's justified interests and objections into account in this respect, it would have cause to fear that it would not be granted that mandate when it came to the next legislative act."
"What this means is that, today in any case, we as a Parliament are in a very strong position in this context."
"To that extent I take the view that, in this context, or on the basis of President Prodi's statement, the equivalence we demanded has been granted."
"Something that strikes me as also especially important is the committee of market participants, which we decided on."
"This represents a first step towards the European Union's lawmaking becoming more modern."
"We must reach the situation in which legislation generally makes a clear distinction, as Alexandre Lamfalussy proposed, between the Parliament and the Council's intentions as joint legislators and the small print of the technical details."
"Here, for example, the supervisory authorities and the experts should be involved, but at the same time the market participants, too, should be included in the structures as purely practical issues are under discussion."
"In that sense I also believe that what we are deciding on today can also be a model for the Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference, and the improvement of the European Union's legislative procedure, and so I wish to ask you to adopt my report."
"Mr President, more and more often in present-day society we are seeing situations where legislators are expected to enact laws very quickly and effectively."
"It would seem that these demands being made with regard to financial services are quite justified."
"This means we really have to evolve a modern legislative process, as Mr von Wogau mentioned."
"Unfortunately, a modern legislative process often seems to mean that it is the European Parliament that is expected to give up some of the legislative powers it enjoys by virtue of the Treaty."
"The problem with the Lamfalussy package is that the European Parliament cannot be completely certain it would not, in fact, be surrendering the legislative power it has on behalf of the citizens of the EU to the Council, on the one hand, and the Commission, on the other."
"In this regard, the European Parliament must ensure that these parliamentary supervisory powers are brought into closer focus."
"As President of this institution, you will surely seize on the proposal that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has put forward: whenever the European Parliament suspects that the Commission is using more than its fair share of powers of implementation, you could negotiate an ad hoc scrutiny mechanism to prevent Parliament' s legislative powers from being watered down."
"We all know that Parliament' s legislative power is not an end in itself: we really try to ensure, on behalf of the public, that decisions are taken openly and democratically, and that all views worthy of attention are taken into consideration during the process."
"It is also perfectly clear that the EC Treaty is no longer relevant to modern times in this respect."
"The Commission' s commitment to amending Article 202 of the Treaty in the very near future, which would restore Parliament' s legislative and supervisory powers, is to be welcomed with open arms."
"It should also be emphasised that the European Union needs a hierarchy of legal acts, with legislative powers and powers of implementation being defined very clearly."
"At present we are in a grey area with this Lamfalussy package, the direct result of level 2 decision-making."
"Mr President, not many Members of this Parliament are attending the debate today in this House."
"And this debate is probably not going to be treated as a priority interest by the media."
"Nevertheless, and I am addressing the public who are in the galleries, this is a very important debate for European citizens."
"I hope that today, after many months of work, negotiation and seeking a consensus, this Parliament will take a decision on the report which has been admirably well drawn up by Karl von Wogau, and which represents one more step forward in the process of constructing an economic and monetary Europe, and furthermore, is an important step within the framework of the process started at the Lisbon European Council aimed at achieving greater flexibility, competitiveness and growth and creating jobs."
"I also hope that this process will include other important decisions at the next European Council in Barcelona."
"At a point when the euro and its implementation have been a great success, this Parliament, the Commission and the Council must demonstrate that they are fulfilling the obligations laid down for them in the Treaties."
"Mr President of the Commission, you have done this recently - and I thank you for being here today - by adopting the appropriate measures and reproaching those countries which are on the point of exceeding the criteria established in Maastricht in the field of deficit."
"This is a good decision, and I am therefore deeply disappointed that the German Commissioner has shown a lack of solidarity in certain comments made in Bild am Sonntag."
"I do not approve of this, because what we want is to maintain the internal cohesion of the European institutions and the balance between all of them."
"In this respect, this exercise is politically positive, because Parliament has had to fight hard to gain its competences, like all parliaments."
"Therefore, having gained them, we want to keep them, since that is what the people demand."
"Baron Lamfalussy' proposals, which we all agree are needed, also mean, in the long run, putting our trust in the European Commission."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to tell you that we have always defended the European Commission, because it is at the heart of the Community institutions and is the most obvious motor for integration."
"However, as Mrs Berès and Mrs Hautala have quite rightly said, we must take precautions."
"We neither can nor want to give anybody a blank cheque."
"That is why this negotiation has gone on so long and has involved so many people."
"And I would like to acknowledge, not only the rapporteur, whose work we have all praised, but also Mrs Randzio-Plath, Mr Napolitano, the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Bolkestein and his team, as well as Mr Rato."
"Mr President, we have finally achieved a text, whose declaration you have read today and which, in the judgment of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, fully satisfies - and I say this emphatically - our expectations: we are going to be treated on an equal basis with the Council, our rights of codecision and the transparency requirements we demanded are going to be guaranteed and there is a formal commitment from the European Commission that, in the next reform of the Treaties, which the Convention is going to analyse, there should be a modification of Article 202."
"Today is therefore a good day for European integration: we are sending messages to the markets that we are prepared to make even more progress in realising all the aspects of economic union."
"It is also good news for the citizens, who, thanks to our choosing this method, are going to see the disappearance of much rigidity, which will give us hope for greater growth and employment in the future."
"Congratulations, Mr Prodi and Mr von Wogau."
"Congratulations to all of you."
"Mr President, what we are debating is the proposal that Parliament and the Council should delegate substantial implementing powers to the Commission."
"Parliament is happy to go along with that, provided there are substantial guarantees as regards the oversight of such delegated powers."
"Those who sometimes worry that in seeking such guarantees Parliament is trying to modify the interinstitutional equilibrium should remember that this substantial delegation of powers is itself a modification of the interinstitutional equilibrium as it exists and that in those circumstances it is quite legitimate for Parliament to seek to obtain certain guarantees."
"After many months of discussion, talks and negotiations with the Commission, the result has now been put forward to us in the form of the statement just made by Mr Prodi."
"I must say that it contains a number of significant steps forward."
"First, the Commission recognises that Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed at the next revision of the Treaty - it supports Parliament's position on that."
"But, in the meantime, the Commission recognises that Parliament has the right to examine and take a position on the implementing measures that it puts forward to the specialist committees that will be set up to work with the Commission."
"Parliament will have three months instead of just one month, as it has under existing procedures, to examine and take a position on such implementing measures."
"The text of the Commission does not limit Parliament's right to examining whether the Commission has gone beyond what has been delegated to it, something which we could anyway solve by means of a legal case, if ever it came to a conflict."
"It gives us the right to object, if need be, on the substance."
"That is also very important."
"But what happens if Parliament objects and then the Commission does not accept its objection to an implementing measure?"
"There the text is a little ambiguous: it speaks of equivalence without saying equivalence with whom."
"Mrs Berès has already made the point: equivalence with the Economic and Social Committee, equivalence with the press?"
"No, it is obvious for us insiders that it means equivalence with the Council."
"That is what we have been talking about for months, and Mr Prodi's introductory remarks made it clear that the Commission too accepts that it means equivalence with the Council."
"That is how we interpret it and I think there can be no other interpretation."
"We have a third step forward and that is a guarantee in case all this does not work."
"We have the sunset clause: after four years the delegated powers will revert to Parliament and the Council, unless we agree to renew them."
"That is a guarantee to us and it will concentrate the minds of the Commission in between times, making it aware that it must exercise these implementing powers in a way that Parliament finds satisfactory if it wishes to have any hope of their renewal."
"Fourthly, we have some important guarantees as regards openness and transparency, and we have acceptance of Parliament's idea that a market participants' committee should be set up alongside the other committees."
"So, all in all, we can be satisfied with the progress that has been made, even if the drafting on the points I made earlier could have been a little better."
"Nonetheless, I would ask whether the full text of the Commission's statement and Mr Prodi's statement today could be incorporated not just in the Verbatim Report of Proceedings but also in the Minutes, because it was a very significant statement and should be recorded in our Minutes, so that we have a proper record of what the Commission has undertaken to do."
"Mr Corbett, your request has been anticipated."
"This will appear in the Minutes as a document of record of some substance."
"Mr President, for more than a year we in Parliament's negotiating teams, together with the Commission and the Council of Ministers, have been struggling with a puzzle."
"We have all agreed with Baron Lamfalussy and his wise men that effective regulation of financial markets and the creation of a single financial market require us to delegate powers to the Commission and to a more nimble official committee."
"But there has been a key problem."
"Although this House was given the power of codecision vis-à-vis such legislation by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it was not given the power to oversee effectively the role of any committee."
"What we have seen of such committees in the past, we have not liked; they have been secretive, bureaucratic, Kafkaesque."
"One condition on which my group insisted was that this culture of secrecy must change fundamentally, opening up decision-making not only to us in Parliament, but to the world outside."
"We needed guarantees of transparency, openness and consultation."
"Here they are in the President's statement and in the letter that Commissioner Bolkestein addressed to the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"But how were we to ensure that those promises of a changed culture, so often honoured in the breach, were finally respected?"
"It became clear that no lasting change could happen before the convention and the intergovernmental conference of 2004 had been concluded."
"Only an IGC could change Article 202, which basically gives sole rights of oversight of committees to the Council of Ministers, ignoring the new role of Parliament."
"We needed a promise that our concerns, ignored in successive treaty revisions, would be taken on board."
"We needed an interim solution that meant that Europe's savers and investors did not have to wait still longer before the completion of the single market in financial services, which was first launched in 1973."
"The health of the European economy depends on this legislation."
"A vital and dynamic economy depends on an efficient financial system for collecting savings and funnelling them at low cost to the most productive uses."
"It was long clear to the Liberal Group that the only interim solution would be to put a time limit on the delegated powers."
"For the first time in EU legislation, we will have a sunset clause that will remove the powers of the Commission and the committee after four years unless they are used wisely and well."
"Thankfully, the initial opposition of the Socialist Group and the European People's Party, together with concerns about legal uncertainty, were overcome."
"Any regulations passed by the committee will remain on the statute book even if its powers are suspended, but Parliament can bite if it needs to."
"This is an important moment for liberalisation of the European economy."
"The deal will underpin the euro - for what is a single currency if the markets on which it is traded are still divided by national barriers?"
"It will give confidence that, whatever the challenges ahead for economic and monetary union, the European Union can surmount them, and it shows that Parliament is a serious and responsible legislature and partner in economic reform."
"The Lisbon reform process is back on track."
"I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr von Wogau, our rapporteur, and commend this report to the House."
"Mr President, what is interesting about this report is the expressed concern for Parliament's rights."
"This is matched by the claim that the committee wants to enhance democratic control over this fast-moving area."
"What I do not see is any concern expressed for those in financial services or for the customers they serve."
"Without dwelling on any particular aspect of the financial services legislation to which this report refers, I have to fulfil my own democratic responsibility and point out that the aggregation of Community legislation is slowly, but inexorably, strangling the financial community and making it almost impossible to trade."
"In this context I am constantly reminded by my constituents that those most affected are the small and independent financial advisers, the net effect being that business is becoming steadily concentrated in the hands of larger and larger firms."
"On the other hand, I see no slackening in the number of financial scandals which break into the headlines."
"In fact, the very reverse seems to be the case."
"Coming as I do from a tradition where parliament is the guarantor of safeguards and freedoms of individuals, I therefore find this report yet another exercise in increasing the power of the Community institutions, with no thought for what the legislation is trying to achieve."
"The committee is counting the angels dancing on the end of a pin while the industry gradually collapses."
"This to me typifies what the Community is about."
"Mr President, President Prodi, Commissioner Bolkestein, once again, we are faced with the inadequacy of the European legislative procedure, as Mr Huhne pointed out a short while ago too."
"In this context, Parliament has two distinct aims, which could have been conflicting: on the one hand, the need to secure a more significant, effective role for Parliament in these matters, to secure, that is, greater democratic legitimisation of the rules we are debating; on the other hand, however, there is the urgent need to conclude the Financial Services Action Plan with all speed in order to implement the common market in this sector."
"We are seriously behind schedule, and the persistence of this hotchpotch of regulations is creating barriers which are costing the European citizens dearly."
"One example is the case of pension funds, which have long been constrained by protectionist rules in the different Member States."
"The average size of European pension funds is one sixth of that of pension funds in the United States and the yield in Europe is 60% of the American figure."
"This represents a severe handicap for pensioners, for savers in general and for the efficiency of the economy."
"The time factor is crucial."
"We are lagging behind severely and we must therefore be responsible in our attitude and not neglect the need to give a vigorous boost to the construction of the internal market in our pursuit of the goal of securing a proper role for our institution."
"To sum up, Mr President, my view is that the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, Mrs Berès, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs have succeeded in achieving a balance between these requirements, providing us with a good short-term solution and pointing the way for the future."
"The Italian radicals will therefore vote for the measure."
"Mr President, as various Members have said, the Commission has been engaged in frequent discussions with those closely involved in this issue in Parliament, and the importance which the Commission gives to this important matter is also reflected in the presence of the Commission President here this morning."
"Various Members have referred to angels this morning - either to the sex of angels or to how many could dance on the head of a pin."
"May I say that it is often in the detail that one encounters the devil."
"Let us hope that the devil and angels will compensate for one another and that we can achieve a balanced compromise this morning."
"According to some Members who have spoken this morning, Mr Méndez de Vigo for example, that is indeed the case."
"He said that this is a good day for integration and offered congratulations to the rapporteur - congratulations which I should like to echo on behalf of the Commission."
"I should like to thank Mr von Wogau and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs very much for having crafted this compromise."
"It is only right that the Commission should give expression to those feelings."
"Mr von Wogau started by referring to the ambition of the European Union as expressed by the European Council in Lisbon, which is, as is well known, that the European Union should become the most competitive place in the world."
"The Lamfalussy report should be seen in that context."
"Mrs Berès also referred to the ambitions expressed in Lisbon."
"Indeed they form a whole, and I do not need to emphasise our wish to give as much impetus and stimulus as possible to our moves towards greater competitiveness."
"Once again, this debate and the result which I hope it produces are of importance to the economic well being of the Union."
"I do not have to explain what the report of the committee headed by Baron Lamfalussy is about and the way it refers to the comitology procedure for implementing measures or executive proposals."
"The report by Mr von Wogau enumerated what has been achieved."
"Mr Corbett has also done so."
"He referred to the fact that, in the Commission's opinion, Article 202 of the Treaty should be changed in the context of the next intergovernmental conference - and this is the heart of the matter."
"Parliament has often impressed upon myself and others the need to achieve equality with the Council in the oversight granted to both Parliament and the Council in considering executive proposals."
"The Commission agrees and also sees the need for equal standing for Parliament vis-à-vis the Council in the whole comitology procedure."
"Unfortunately, from the point of view of Parliament - and the Commission recognises its feelings and opinions - this is not possible at the moment."
"Article 202 is clear: the comitology procedure arrived at in June 1999 is also clear and, as much as the Commission sees the point of view of Parliament and has said so in its own White Paper on governance, it is at present unable to grant Parliament's wishes."
"The Commission's view as laid down in the White Paper on governance is that Article 202 ought to be changed."
"However, the Commission itself cannot do that; any such change has to take place in connection with the next intergovernmental conference."
"Mr Corbett mentioned that Parliament now has three months to consider the executive measures put forward by the Commission."
"There is full equality with the Council here, and that is a good thing."
"He went on to say that Parliament now has the possibility to object in substance."
"Yes, indeed, the substance concerns us all and Parliament has the inherent right to put forward its positions and its arguments."
"The Commission has said that it will take the fullest possible account of Parliament's position."
"That is also what Parliament would want the Commission to do."
"Mr Corbett spoke about equivalence - a fine word - but equivalence with whom?"
"Obviously, equivalence with the Council."
"That is what the whole debate is about and it would not do to deny what is clear to every one."
"Parliament wants that equivalence with the Council; the Commission is willing to grant it, takes the same view, and has said so in its declaration and in discussions."
"Mr Corbett mentioned a sunset clause, which is another example of a weapon available to Parliament to ensure that the Commission takes the utmost account of Parliament's wishes."
"The sunset clause means that the delegation of executive measures to the Commission lasts for no longer than four years."
"It may be prolonged on the initiative of the Commission, but it certainly keeps the Commission's nose to the grindstone and is a powerful weapon available to Parliament."
"The same applies to another factor, mentioned by Mr von Wogau."
"In his introductory statement Mr von Wogau said that if the Commission does not carry out its promises - as set out in the declaration made by Mr Prodi - then the next time a directive comes around Parliament knows that it can keep a tight rein on the Commission."
"The Commission is well aware of that."
"That is another way in which Parliament can put forward its opinion forcefully and with conviction."
"The Commission would therefore be well advised to listen carefully and take the utmost account of that opinion."
"Mr Corbett's last remark - apart from the desire to have the declaration put into the Minutes - was on openness and transparency."
"The Commission has stated this morning and in the letter I sent on 2 October to Mrs Randzio-Plath, chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that it is most willing to practise that openness and transparency."
"Mr Titford said that the industry would collapse."
"Methinks this is a poetic exaggeration."
"I am not under the impression that the industry is about to collapse."
"Yes, scandals emerge - perhaps less so in the European Union than in other parts of the world - but that is a fact of life."
"I do not think the proposals made by Mr Prodi this morning will fuel more scandals."
"They will, in fact, go a long way towards avoiding them, and therefore I cannot agree with the sentiments expressed by Mr Titford."
"Finally, I come back to Mr Méndez de Vigo who said that it was a good day for integration."
"He congratulated Mr von Wogau, and I join him in that."
"I wish to congratulate Mr von Wogau personally on the fact that at 11 o'clock this morning he will receive a high French decoration, the Légion d'Honneur."
"The Commission congratulates him."
"I will have the opportunity to reply to further questions later in the debate, so I rest the Commission's case here."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you to record Mr Bolkestein' s comments in the Minutes of our meeting, because, if I am not mistaken, Mr Bolkestein is correcting Mr Prodi on a crucial point."
"He is saying that the word 'equivalence' does indeed mean equivalence between Parliament and the Council."
"Mr President, may I briefly reply to Mr Goebbels?"
"There is no contradiction between what the President said and what I said."
"The equivalence is with the Council and nobody has ever thought differently."
"Colleagues, if you read the text of Mr Prodi's preliminary remarks, you will see they carry the sentiment in substance."
"Those remarks will be Minuted."
"They cover the issue that has been referred to."
"Mr President, on behalf of the British Conservatives and the rest of the PPE-DE Group I would like to say that we strongly support the compromise set out in the von Wogau report and reiterated by Mr Prodi this morning."
"Parliament has secured significant concessions on transparency, on consultation and on oversight."
"Parliament's rapporteur is to be congratulated for securing those."
"Parliament should also express its appreciation to Mr Bolkestein and his staff, and to the Commission, for responding to the concerns that we raised about these matters."
"Mr von Wogau deserves much praise for drawing to a conclusion the lengthy negotiations that we have had on this important issue."
"We in Parliament have taken a pragmatic approach."
"This is a workable interim solution pending final resolution of the whole matter of delegated legislation in 2004, when Parliament could and should ask for a legally binding call-back mechanism, which is desirable but, sadly, not permissible within the terms of the current Treaty and arrangements."
"It is of vital importance that Parliament backs this compromise when it votes at 12 noon today, because without it we will not be in a position to deliver an integrated financial market - whether in 2004, 2005 or indeed ever."
"That financial market is not just of interest to bankers; it could also lead to cheaper prices and a wider choice of financial products for consumers and businesses, cheaper borrowing, higher returns for savers and investors, as well as doing a great deal to start defusing the pensions time bomb."
"All these are highly significant benefits to the ordinary people who elected us to serve on their behalf."
"Accepting this compromise will bring us considerably closer to achieving our goal of an integrated financial market and delivering those benefits to ordinary people right across the European Union."
"Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I want to vigorously emphasise that nobody in this House underestimates the significance of the financial markets."
"We all know how important it is that we catch up on the United States' integrated market in terms of the productivity of capital."
"On the other hand, we are also aware that the European financial market has significance not only for enterprises but also for those who rely on proper provision for old age, in other words who are, as consumers, dependent on it in view of their small pensions."
"Parliament therefore bears a heavy responsibility for coming to the right decisions in the co-decision procedure."
"In today's proceedings, with our debate on the von Wogau report, we have an extremely sensitive topic to deal with."
"The rapporteur has attempted to find cautious formulations in order to give a chance to all the parties who are particularly sensitive to the effects of this legislative process."
"I wish to underline again that Parliament, which demands more and more rights of co-decision, will not refrain from doing so in the parliamentary legislative procedure and that today's compromise in the von Wogau report is without prejudice to the possibility of Parliament giving up this legal position."
"If we come to a transitional arrangement for secondary legislation today, that will only mean that we as a Parliament had previously been unable to push through the cementing of secondary legislation in the Treaty."
"That had previously been a matter for the Commission."
"In my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to Mr Bolkestein for the fact that our negotiations on governance, laborious and difficult though they were, nonetheless succeeded in getting this formulation incorporated into the White Paper as a Commission proposal."
"That is a success in which we all share."
"Now we also have to achieve a successful conclusion to the next Intergovernmental Conference and the next amendment of the Treaties."
"That is, without a doubt, very important."
"One question, though, has not been answered - that of to what extent we can actually attribute real significance to the Lamfalussy procedure in all this legislation, because all of what has been described as technical, today, is very often political."
"Parliament cannot be satisfied with a role legislating only in outline; we must rather still hold on to our authority to define, item by item, detail by detail, paragraph by paragraph, and article by article."
"We shall pay attention to that. I think it should also be clear, Mr Prodi, following your statement and also Mr Bolkestein's, that we will also take care to ensure that Mr Bolkestein's letter of 2 October to the committee will also, as an interpretation, be part of this protocol."
"The third thing that is clear is that, by its two statements, the Commission is committing itself, today, in the implementation of the Lamfalussy procedure, not, under any circumstances, to follow the recommendations of the Securities Committee against a qualified majority."
"This was, fortunately, clear today."
"So I think we can be full of optimism and constructive spirit in approaching this form of cooperation on the basis of parity and equivalence."
"Mr President, I should like to say thank you to Mr von Wogau who has expertly prepared a very well-considered report on this difficult issue."
"It is an issue which has been waiting to be solved for a very long time, and I wish to be the first to welcome a solution."
"Our debate today shows the general dilemma we face between, on the one hand, wishing to be effective and, on the other hand, wishing to secure democratic control by means of the legislation we adopt, and it is this issue of, on the one hand, effectiveness, and, on the other hand, democratic control which is to be discussed in detail during the forthcoming Convention."
"Those of us who want to see clear ground rules for the European institutions are often criticised for being nit picking and preoccupied with power."
"I disagree very strongly with that view."
"In my country, Denmark, we had a constitutional struggle that lasted from 1866 right up to 1901, in which parliamentarianism was finally adopted as the central democratic principle."
"It is the same process we are now in the throes of at European level."
"I am therefore also very pleased that, in the midst of this struggle, we in the EU are able to deliver a result, namely this practical agreement."
"To refer again to the situation in Denmark 130 years ago, the whole political system was just about paralysed during the Danish constitutional struggle."
"I am therefore very pleased about the President of the Commission' s, Mr Prodi' s, statement that the Commission approves the content of this report, which ought to receive considerable support from the European Parliament."
"However, it is extremely important that the Council not merely accept the content, but also the basic message, of this report."
"Quite a few Members of the Council basically believe that this whole matter is futile and is merely a case of Parliament' s making a nuisance of itself."
"That is not so."
"It is, in short, about exercising democratic control by means of our common European legislation."
"Mr President, I will comment briefly on five points."
"Firstly, at this point in the debate the facts have been well established."
"The history of the tempestuous relations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been well described and if, as Lenin said, only fools discuss the facts, I do not want to fall into that temptation and I will say no more on this point."
"Secondly, if you will allow me to speak autobiographically, I belong to the generation of Spaniards who well recognise the importance of parliament in a democracy."
"What is more, I was part of the Spanish Parliament that created the Constitution."
"I therefore have great sympathy for Mrs Randzio-Plath' s defence of the rights of Parliament."
"Thirdly, to continue in an autobiographical vein, I am also a committed European and I am absolutely sure that, just as the euro was essential yesterday, today structural reforms are absolutely necessary and, amongst them, we must place special emphasis on the reform of financial services if we want the European economy to be competitive."
"My fourth point is the reconciliation of these two objectives: doing things well and doing them quickly, speeding up the process and respecting the rights of Parliament, must be carried out, as Mr Huhne said, within strict limits, the limits laid down in Article 202, which are badly worded and whose reform we advocate."
"Finally, the solution to this dilemma has been discovered by the new Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour, Karl von Wogau, and supported by this Parliament."
"I hope that the Commission appreciates this vote of confidence from Parliament in the Commission and the Council, and that it will never fall into the temptation - since Mr Bolkestein likes Latin - to alter the par conditio, because the reaction of a spurned lover is unpredictable."
"Parliament has the powers to try to go into the maximum detail within level 1, which would delay the process."
"Parliament could, like a spurned lover, delay discussing the proposals and that would mean doing the opposite to what we should be doing."
"I believe that today is a great day for all of us."
"I congratulate Karl von Wogau, the Commission and the Council and I hope that in Barcelona we will be able to reap the harvest which we have begun to sow today."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is indeed a most decisive day as far as the role of Parliament is concerned."
"President Prodi's statement - which I see as an undertaking by the Commission - has made clear in an unprecedented way that the Commission will put its weight behind the idea that the two components of the legislature should have real equality of rights in what they do."
"I believe that what Commissioner Bolkestein had to say was also of particular value."
"It was, in particular, thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath's initiative and endeavours that we were able to convince Commissioner Bolkestein as well, something that was not so easy, nor was it clear from the outset that we would be able to do it."
"I do not believe that Commissioner Bolkestein has now been transformed from a devil into an angel, for we did not see him as a devil and he is not an angel now, but a good piece of work has been done."
"Commissioner Bolkestein, I would also like to express my respect for the way you today clarified and enlarged on what President Prodi said."
"Firstly, I see this as a clear commitment by the Commission to bring about the parity, as President Prodi stated, of the two components of the legislature, to give equal weight and value to the roles of the two legislative bodies, the Council and Parliament, and finally, to do so by means of the amendment to Article 202."
"The statement is clear and unequivocal, and it is as such that we will always, to some extent, keep it in mind."
"There are, secondly, definite statements on how this equal treatment will affect financial services."
"I assume that other areas are also affected by the intention - even subject to the legal position as depicted by Mr Bolkestein - to do everything legally permissible to achieve de facto equal treatment for the two components of the legislature."
"I must acknowledge that what you say, Mr Bolkestein, is indeed how the law stands."
"What I can read between the lines, though, is that the legal position will not be used to keep the unequal treatment in place until Article 202 is amended, but that everything possible is to be done in the meantime to achieve de facto equal treatment of the two legislative bodies in all essential matters."
"For my third point, Mr President, I will address you, for it has to do with the setting up of an interinstitutional working party to make appropriate preparations, something which President Prodi has repeatedly urged, most recently persuading Mr Aznar, the President-in-Office of the Council, to give a positive response to the effect that this working party is now actually going to be convened."
"I would think it right and proper, Mr President, if joint discussions in the Conference of Presidents were to prompt you also to take the initiative in order to achieve what, as I have said, President Prodi was the first to propose, namely this interinstitutional working party."
"Today is an important day in the sense that it is now a matter of record that we recognise the knowledge and insight possessed by the experts, but at the same time that democratic control means that it is parliaments that, at the end of the day, decide on political objectives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr von Wogau on the wonderful work he has done on this report."
"This report and the statements made about it by both the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and Commissioner Bolkestein, free up a process which has really prevented the speed that we would have liked in the negotiation of projects and the proposals for the creation of an internal market in the financial sector."
"In the little time remaining for me, I would like to focus on two aspects."
"Firstly, once we have freed up the process by means of the agreement that today' s debate represents, what we have to do is get to work."
"That is to say, we have to make the 42 directives envisaged a reality, by 2003 in the case of the capital market and by 2005 in the case of financial services."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that the European Parliament has never created obstacles when it has been asked for speed, urgency and cooperation in the implementation of projects and issues of such importance as the implementation of the euro or the European internal market itself, which are two very important successes of European construction."
"The Commission has not normally created obstacles, nor has Parliament, and if we have ever been faced with obstacles, it has been in the Council."
"In other words, everybody must fulfil their responsibilities."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take up a position on this issue and propose to do so in seven stages."
"Firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for this report and for his gesture of commitment to various committees and institutions, in order to resume progress towards realisation of a common objective."
"This instance has provided an answer to the question as to what sex an angel is; here the parliamentary angel was a male one in the person of Karl von Wogau."
"Secondly, I would like to thank him, again, today for the excellent work he has done for the Community on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which he has left after many decades and to which - as to all the other committees he sits on, as this report shows - he has brought massive experience and economic knowledge."
"Thank you, Karl."
"My second point - and this is probably beyond doubt - is that we must speed up the Lisbon process, and - not only for that reason, but certainly for that reason - we must create an internal market for securities as rapidly as possible."
"My third point is that whoever wants to do that must take all necessary steps to enhance the efficiency of the decision-making procedure and accelerate the legislative process."
"That, after all, is the reason for this report and for the Lamfalussy report too."
"There is just one contradiction I wish to clear up."
"There is no contradiction between speeding up the procedure and Parliament having greater efficiency and more codecision."
"There is a contradiction between Article 202 and Parliament's codecision procedure; that is why it needs to be amended."
"So I do not only expect codecision, information and transparency to be adhered to, as this is so formulated in most of the translations of the Commission's reports; rather, I expect us to make every effort to help bring to fruition something that is a fundamental Parliamentary right and a precondition for transparency and information."
"This report is an important step towards making this possible."
"In this connection, I would like to direct your attention to item 5 of the report - I do not need to explain it at the moment - and to two events that show why we are so sceptical."
"I recall that the Commission presented a report in October 2000 on occupational pension schemes, which Parliament adopted in July by 460 votes, yet the Council has not, to date, adopted a Common Position on it."
"I recall the European Company, on which we are in agreement on matters of content but not at all as regards form, because we act on the basis of Article 95 and, in Nice, the Council pulled the legal basis for codecision from under our feet."
"That is why we are so sceptical."
"Now for my last point."
"Mr President of the Commission, I wish to refer in this context to the sentence in your statement in which you said that it is the introduction of the euro that makes this report so important, and that, by this report, we are contributing to a strong and solid capital market."
"I therefore do not at all understand how a member of your Commission can, in a German newspaper, criticise your decision to send a notice of poor performance to the Federal Republic of Germany and actually dissociate himself from the thinking behind it."
"I would like a statement on that as well, as the Stability Pact and adherence to it are issues affecting the credibility of the euro and a precondition for public confidence in it."
"I consider the letter necessary because we must not differentiate between States, but must do our utmost to ensure that the Stability Pact is applied to everyone equally and with its full weight."
"Anyone who dissociates himself from that is endangering the credibility of the Stability Pact and, thereby, confidence in the euro."
"Mr President, Mr von Wogau has submitted an excellent report."
"Nevertheless, Mr Prodi' s answer is not totally satisfactory, because Mr Prodi was still vague on the crucial point, namely that of equal rights between the Council and Parliament."
"Mr Prodi tells us that the Commission is declaring its political will to work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment."
"Equal with whom and equal to what?"
"Commissioner Bolkestein told us that we must not discuss the sex of angels, but that 'equivalence' obviously means equivalence between Parliament and the Council."
"At the same time, however, Mr Bolkestein is warning us that the Commission cannot guarantee us this equivalence."
"Why did Mr Prodi not use these simple words, namely 'equal treatment with the Council' ?"
"Mr President, I am the European Parliament' s rapporteur on the market abuse directive."
"I must now table an amendment, therefore, laying down in substance that the Commission will be permitted to make technical amendments to this directive and that Parliament will have three months in which to respond."
"If, within this time, Parliament has not adopted a resolution stating that the proposed technical amendments go beyond the executing powers specified in the directive, the Commission will stop its measures."
"So far, so good!"
"If this does not happen, I will have to write 'the Commission will work towards a situation where Parliament enjoys equal treatment' ."
"Mr President, who are you trying to fool?"
"Can you really propose this sort of text to Parliament?"
"I think that the Commission must make a commitment to show respect for the resolutions adopted by Parliament."
"That, Mr President, is democracy - pure and simple."
"Mr President, even though I have only two minutes in which to speak, I have to begin by saying this: Esteemed Commissioners, we MEPs are now committed to working on the assumption that the Commission's statement is made in accordance with the thinking behind the codecision procedure and on the basis of the role played by Parliament and the Council in the Lamfalussy procedure being one of equivalence and parity."
"And what are we doing today?"
"This is a very important stage in the new European Union's coming into being, and I think we have managed to specify what paper and pencils are to be used, where the entrances will be, which architects to appoint and what they can do and when they can do it on the road towards standardised financial services."
"What we should not forget in all this, though, is what the edifice will look like, because it will be one of the most important high-rise blocks in the European Union."
"Following this trial of strength between Parliament, Commission and Council, the issue is now what we want this building to be like."
"That is the next step and also what we in Parliament expect."
"Our expectation is that the standardisation of financial services will not result in the problem of consumers having this sort of excess of information, that, in other words, once equal entitlement to them is offered without regard to national frontiers, that it does not come pouring in like a flood of videoclips inundating the consumers, who will then be 'overnewsed and underinformed' ."
"We, of course, expect to prevent the big businesses' desire for excessive market concentration, resulting in a mere two or three players ending up defining the market."
"The insurers Allianz have said that they will only go into markets where they will be among the top three, and that, on an international level, will become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"The third problem is the insecurity of investors."
"We are implementing this at a time when only 65% of Germans who invest in stocks and shares state that they want to carry on doing so."
"We live at a time when we have to deal with the collapse of important pension facilities in the USA, and 'ruinitis' is going round."
"This must not be allowed to happen in Europe."
"There you have a demand for what your legislation should contain."
"If we end up with USA-style unequal distribution, then we in Europe will have failed."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the speakers for this excellent debate on an extremely important subject, which has focused both on the matter at hand and, more importantly, on its symbolic value and on the joint commitments we must make for the future."
"We all know, we all realise that we need to respect the current sensitive and possibly inadequate balance between institutional matters and policy, but we also know that we will have ample opportunity to go back over these issues during the debate launched within the Convention."
"Today, the Commission has committed itself according to the terms of the statement I have read - and it could do no more - but soon it will undertake to work with Parliament to ensure that its institutional rights are fully recognised."
"Mr President, Mrs Randzio-Plath has drawn to our attention the importance of financial markets and the Commission wholeheartedly subscribes to her words in that respect."
"She said so in order to stress the importance of the report by Mr von Wogau and there again the Commission agrees with Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Mrs Villiers very succinctly put her finger on the sore spot by saying that a compromise is necessary and that is what we are discussing this morning because the call-back option is not permitted under the Treaty and the comitology procedure."
"That is perfectly correct."
"Mrs Villiers then went on to say that we are talking here about benefits for ordinary people."
"There again the Commission wholeheartedly agrees."
"Fortunately we are living in the European Union where more and more ordinary people own shares and all we are doing this morning is providing a legislative framework which safeguards the interests of ordinary people."
"I am very pleased to say that we are making good progress in this work."
"If I have understood Mrs Randzio-Plath correctly, her interpretation implies that the Commission would not go against a simple majority in Parliament."
"Without saying so she refers to the ""aerosol declaration"" which the Commission appended to the comitology decision of June 1999."
"If that is what she meant - this is not the first time that Mrs Randzio-Plath and I have discussed this matter - then that is not a possibility for the Commission because, as Mrs Villiers and other Members of Parliament know, it does not agree with the comitology decision or with Article 202."
"I should like to address Mr Goebbels' comments."
"He said that the Commission should show respect for Parliament's resolutions."
"The Commission does show respect for Parliament's resolutions."
"More to the point, the Commission has said that it will take the fullest account of Parliament's position."
"What more can Mr Goebbels want?"
"I should like to add that the Commission has respect for Parliament's resolutions, but it has more respect for the Treaty."
"It has more respect for the agreed comitology procedure."
"The Commission shows respect all around but is bound by the formalities of the Treaty and wishes its words to be interpreted in that way."
"Mr Goebbels also made reference to the word ""equivalence""."
"The Commission has very clearly indicated its sympathy with Parliament's position with respect to Article 202."
"It has laid that down in black and white in the White Paper on comitology."
"The Commission will continue to work on that basis - as stated by the Commission President, Mr Prodi, when he said that the Commission would continue to do that and, fully respecting the existing institutional balance, the Commission would treat Parliament and the Council on an equal footing."
"In the end we are striving for what we can achieve only at the next IGC, which hopefully will start in the year 2004."
"Since this is close to the hearts of Members of Parliament, may I end by summarising in seven points the safeguards which this Parliament has."
"Firstly, the extent of delegated powers will be defined through codecision."
"Secondly, there will be a fully open and transparent process including a market participants' group attached to the European Securities Regulators' Committee."
"Thirdly, there will be a sunset clause - and this is in response to a specific request from Mr Huhne in this Parliament - limiting the duration of the delegated powers to four years after adoption of each legislative act."
"Fourthly, the Commission, as I have mentioned a few times this morning, will take the utmost account of Parliament's position and of any resolution - Mr Goebbels - stating that the Commission has exceeded its delegated powers."
"Fifthly, the Commission will support a change to Article 202 at the next IGC."
"Sixthly, there will be a full and open review in 2004 and we hope an interinstitutional monitoring group to ensure everyone carries out their commitments connected with the Lamfalussy process."
"Seventhly and lastly, if the Commission fails to respect its engagements Parliament will not grant any further delegated powers in future."
"In effect, Parliament can make its voice heard in no uncertain fashion and the Commission is bound to listen to that."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for their constructive attitude."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath was kind enough to say a few kind words in my direction."
"May I reciprocate and say that I have always found the discussions with the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs very fruitful, friendly and, in the end I hope, constructive."
"Mr President, may I briefly put a question to Commissioner Bolkestein?"
"On the basis of which article of the Treaty did the Commission agree, at Stockholm, to declare that it would not go against a majority opinion of the Council?"
"Mr President, both Mr Goebbels and Mrs Randzio-Plath are well aware of the answer."
"They know that when the comitology procedure was decided on in mid-1999, the Commission issued a unilateral declaration, which has become known as the ""aerosol"" declaration, which was given in exchange for something called the contre-filet, another procedural device."
"The Commission and Council accepted that the contre-filet procedure would disappear, and in its place came this unilateral declaration, which referred to a much earlier case in connection with veterinary matters."
"That is why in the unilateral Commission declaration mention was made of particularly sensitive cases, because the veterinary situation back in the early 1980s concerned human health."
"The declaration stated - again by way of replacement of the contre-filet procedure - that the Commission would not go against a majority opinion of the Council, thereby basically maintaining the status quo, while bringing things into sharper focus."
"Therefore the Stockholm resolution adds nothing beyond what was already in place under the comitology procedure, because the same words - the ipsissima verba - that appeared in the declaration by the Commission in June 1991 reappear in the resolution of the European Council."
"So matters have basically remained the same."
"If Mr Goebbels is asking on which article this is based, then the reply is on Articles 202 and 211."
"Mr President, there has been a qualitative change in the form of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This shows me, though, how necessary it actually is to have secondary legislation on a basis that accords with the Treaties."
"I just want to ask whether the Commission is now, at last, declaring itself willing to grant the competent committee in Parliament, the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, observer status on the Securities Committee and invite it to the meetings on a regular basis."
"Mr President, much as the Commission would like to come to a final and positive agreement with Parliament, I regret that on this specific point the Commission cannot agree with Mrs Randzio-Plath since the presence of a parliamentary observer in the Securities Committee would not be in accordance with normal constitutional principles."
"As Mrs Randzio-Plath says, it would amount to a mixing of executive and legislative powers, and for that reason the Commission cannot see its way to agreeing with the chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at noon."
"Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco"
"The next item is the debate on the second report (Á5-0016/2002) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Article 93 of the Treaty states that efforts must be made to harmonise excise, that Parliament must be consulted in this procedure and that the aim of the Treaty is to harmonise taxation to the extent that harmonisation is necessary to ensure the establishment and the functioning of the internal market within the time-limit laid down in Article 14."
"Of course, Article 14 expired a long time ago, back in December 1992; however, as the internal market has not quite been completed, the purpose of the Commission's first proposal was to serve the objectives of Article 93, with which we have no choice but to agree, given that they derive directly from the Treaty."
"Because Parliament has a consultative role in the matter, the Council is pushing for a fast response from us."
"The Commission too has put pressure on Parliament, brandishing the fact that the Council is in unanimous political agreement on the matter, so all that is left is for us to endorse the Council's and the Commission's faits accomplis."
"This was, in my view, an unfortunate way of dealing with Parliament, especially on the part of the Commission, because it is tantamount to asking Parliament merely to endorse a fait accompli without making any contribution of its own whatsoever."
"Our purpose in life is not to sign blank cheques, Commissioner."
"And, may I say to the Council that I trust that its haste in requesting an urgent procedure does not mean that it is merely going through the motions and that it will give serious attention to Parliament's opinion, into which, I can assure you, we have put a great deal of thought."
"Parliament has already rejected the previous Commission proposal by a large majority."
"The main tenet of that proposal was to impose a minimum fixed tax of EUR 70 per 1000 cigarettes, alongside the minimum 57% tax charged on the most popular market brand."
"I do not want to go into the technicalities of how this tax is calculated at this point."
"Parliament rejected the proposal because it accepted the following arguments: first, imposing a minimum fixed tax would put small and medium-sized tobacco companies at a distinct disadvantage."
"Assuming that the only way a small tobacco company manages to get its most popular brand on to the market is by reducing the price, it immediately faces a heavy fixed tax which bears no relation to its production costs, putting it at a disadvantage in relation to large tobacco companies."
"Secondly, the immediate effect of the Commission proposal was to increase prices in southern countries, where per capita income is lower than in the northern countries in the main zone of the Union."
"Insofar as taxes were harmonised, they were harmonised upwards, by increasing prices."
"Parliament had, in fact, called for this sort of harmonisation in the past, but it was clear from the last vote that the new Parliament voted in took a different view and in 1996 and 1999, Commissioner, the rapporteurs voted against the Commission proposal."
"I believe that Parliament is now convinced that constantly increasing the price of cigarettes does not achieve the objective, which I support, of reducing smoking; all it does is to reduce legal sales of cigarettes and encourage cigarette smuggling which, in some countries, has reached worrying proportions."
"In addition, the Commission proposal would result in astronomical price increases in candidate countries of 200% to 400%."
"Consequently, the Commission's old proposal, which in essence forms the basis for the Council's political agreement, does not serve the purpose of Article 93 because it tends to destabilise rather than consolidate the internal market."
"However, as the Commission and the Council are determined to stand by their initial position, although they have no reason to do so, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked me to table a compromise proposal."
"This proposal is as follows: the Council can adopt the Commission's initial ideas and Parliament will withdraw its opposition to them."
"However, it will call for an alternative method of harmonising taxes."
"This alternative will be based on a combination of minimum excise duty of 57% plus a minimum value added tax of 15% which, once the relevant mathematical formula has been applied, gives a harmonised tax of around 71%."
"So what we propose is to introduce two methods of taxation and to allow the Member State in question to choose between them."
"The pros of this solution are as follows: first, it will not push up prices and put the industry in certain Member States in the south at a disadvantage."
"This is, of course, vital to the candidate countries, as I have already said."
"Secondly, it will help to harmonise prices, in that we already had price convergence with the minimum 57% tax and it was the value-added tax which was causing the fluctuations."
"Consequently, our new proposal does more for harmonisation than the Commission proposal."
"Thirdly, it allows Member States to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises from distortions of competition caused by imposing a fixed tax."
"And by shifting the focus away from price increases on cigarettes, these measures will discourage smuggling."
"I think the Council should show courage and imagination, accept the two different versions and leave the final decision to the Member States."
"I am positive that the new proposal, which I am confident my fellow Members will support, has so many advantages that the Member States will opt for it and we shall soon have just one system of harmonised taxation."
"Allow me to finish, Commissioner and members of the Council, by saying that I, too, want to see smoking reduced."
"But I do not think that we can do so by constantly hiking up prices."
"Cigarettes are already extremely expensive in Europe and smoking shows no signs of abating."
"Which is why I am against the amendments tabled by Members trying to support the anti-smoking campaign by raising prices. I do not think the price mechanism can be used to achieve everything."
"There is much that it can be used to achieve, but not everything, which is why I am against these proposals."
"This is my compromise proposal to Parliament and I call on the Commission and the Council to take it seriously and not to look on it as a mere formality, because that would be insulting to Parliament."
"Mr President, it is with some regret that I must disagree slightly with my colleague, Mr Katiforis."
"I am speaking particularly on behalf of the UK PSE delegation in order to say that we will not be supporting this report for many of the reasons that Mr Katiforis has already outlined."
"We do not accept the argument that price makes no difference to the amount of cigarettes consumed."
"In fact, I have figures here from the UK, which show that a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes leads to a 4% decrease in consumption."
"So there is a link between the cost of smoking and the amount that is actually smoked."
"That is the case that the UK PSE delegation is making, particularly with regard to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 on reducing the excise duty below that set out in the original report."
"It is important for Parliament to vote against this report, because very recently we adopted the tobacco directive, which, as we all know, took various public health measures to reduce smoking."
"It therefore seems very inconsistent to adopt this report, which seeks to pass measures and form opinions which will, to some extent, go against the measures we have already taken on public health grounds."
"That is not to say that we do not understand the issues raised about the applicant countries and about small and medium-sized tobacco producers."
"If voting against this report has an effect on them, that is unfortunate and is not something that we would wish to see."
"But when we are discussing tobacco we are talking about a product which is harmful to health wherever you happen to live, and that is the main argument."
"This is a health measure rather than anything to do with production or with harmonising duty, though that we accept the latter as a principle."
"I felt that I needed to explain our position and say why the UK PSE will be voting against this report later today."
"Mr President, it is obvious to us, too, that increased prices lead to a drop in the consumption of tobacco products, particularly cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco."
"The situation in the United States and Sweden, where excise is very high and consumption relatively low, illustrate this trend, as well as a study conducted by the World Bank."
"In two previous resolutions from 1996 and 1997, the European Parliament left no doubt as to the fact that it is seeking an upward harmonisation of tobacco prices by means of increased excise duty."
"As the Commission proposes in the explanatory note, the new minimum excise amount in euros for cigarettes is based on the average excise yield in the Member States, namely EUR 90 per 1 000 cigarettes and subsequently reduced to EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes in order to prevent the majority of the Member States from having to increase their excise duties."
"It is, in this connection, once again worth mentioning that the excise yield in nine Member States is even more than EUR 70 per 1 000 cigarettes."
"This is why my group is opposed to a further reduction."
"In our view, Commissioner Bolkestein' s proposal is a big improvement on the current situation."
"He already mentioned health aspects during previous discussions a few months ago."
"We would like to further reinforce this aspect."
"We have tabled a number of amendments, in conjunction also with Mr Blokland."
"Firstly, there is the VAT issue in respect of which the rapporteur has submitted proposals which we support."
"Secondly, we believe that this matter should be firmly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Health Organisation."
"We are of the opinion that more should be done to combat differences in smuggling prices, since they form one of the reasons for fraud and smuggling, although they are not the only reason."
"In our view, a system should be considered during the four-yearly review by means of which the use of more harmful products can be discouraged."
"In the final analysis, and I am taking this opportunity to repeat what I have said before, it remains an unacceptable anomaly, on the one hand, to increase the excise duty on tobacco products, although partly for health reasons and, on the other hand, to continue to heavily subsidise tobacco growing in the European Union."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that cigarettes seriously damage your health."
"However, it is hypocrisy on the part of the Commission to maintain that it is helping to protect public health by introducing more taxes on tobacco products, which are a widely consumed product, when it leaves consumers at the mercy of very dangerous products in the food chain, imported tobacco products of dubious quality, and is pushing for health to be completely privatised."
"One thing is for sure: increasing taxes - and hence the price to the consumer - will not reduce smoking."
"Otherwise it would surely have happened by now."
"What will happen if taxes are increased is that consumers on lower incomes will be forced to buy cheaper contraband cigarettes from third countries which are possibly even more damaging to their health."
"In other words, smuggling will increase, not decrease, as the Commission maintains."
"The proposed measures will increase the cost of living at a time when consumers' wages are constantly being eroded by the policy of the European Union."
"The campaign against smoking and the campaign against tobacco cultivation in the European Union have become one and the same and we are against that."
"The campaign against smoking benefits consumers' health, while the campaign against tobacco cultivation benefits large-scale producers and industry, mainly in the USA, to the detriment of tobacco farmers and processors in southern Europe."
"That is precisely why we are against abolishing or even reducing tobacco-farming subsidies, as many would have us do."
"That would wipe out tobacco farming in the European Union, which would then be wholly dependent on imported cigarettes."
"These are just some of the reasons why we are against any form of additional excise because, as I have already said, it does nothing to protect public health; in fact, it may well have the opposite effect."
"Finally, we suggest that revenue from tobacco taxes should be used to fund education, preventive measures and centres where smokers can kick the habit and obtain treatment."
"Thank you, Mr President, we all seek clarity, including clarity in the policy on tobacco products and the excise duty that applies to them, excise yields which are largely used to combat the negative effects tobacco consumption has on health."
"Unfortunately, Mr Katiforis' s report lacks this required clarity."
"However, the report has made it clear that the rapporteur wants to protect the interests of the tobacco industry, and particularly in those countries where products are also available at low prices."
"The rapporteur' s approach serves the interests of the cigarette industry and not the interests of the citizen."
"It is therefore very disappointing to note that the rapporteur confines himself to amending the Commission proposal where the level of excise duty is concerned without giving a reasoned consideration."
"This consideration is something which the European Commission itself does give with regard to increasing excise duty, namely in terms of promoting a well functioning internal market and discouraging smoking by pursuing a consistent and convincing policy."
"This is underlined in the amendments I have tabled together with Mr Maaten."
"In the past, Parliament has in two resolutions clearly called for an upward fiscal harmonisation of excise on tobacco."
"The claim that the increase in excise would encourage smuggling is not proven."
"Quite the reverse, in fact, smuggling practices occur precisely in those areas where tobacco products are cheap."
"However, research has shown that the increase in tobacco prices encourages people to quit smoking and deters non-smoking young people from taking up the habit."
"It will be to the credit of Parliament if the amendments that I have tabled together with Mr Maaten are adopted."
"Finally, I should like to note once again that, sadly, one billion euros' worth of tobacco subsidies still go up in carcinogenic smoke."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the United States - a country which has achieved the most striking results in curbing cigarette consumption - the incidence of taxation in relation to price is much lower than in all the European countries, even those with the lowest excise duty levels."
"I feel that this is a benchmark we must not disregard."
"There is another factor that we must not lose sight of."
"The British Member said that increasing prices leads to a reduction in cigarette consumption, and this is evidence to prove it."
"However, what happened in Italy is that an increase in cigarette prices brought about by an increase in taxation did indeed reduce the consumption of cigarettes sold on official markets but only because it greatly increased the consumption of contraband cigarettes."
"This is especially true in that cigarette smuggling takes place not between European countries with differing excise duty levels - and we would point out that excise duties in the United States vary from State to State - but from outside Europe to inside Europe: cigarettes are smuggled from Montenegro across the Adriatic and by this route to the whole of Europe."
"Moreover, we will be in danger of exacerbating this phenomenon of criminal, mafia smuggling if we continue to pursue this policy of increasing excise duties."
"The positive results obtained in terms of public health in the United States - I want the Members to understand this - were pursued and achieved by applying lower rates of excise duty than in Europe."
"Mr President, I will make a few brief and concise observations."
"I fully agree with what the rapporteur said about the legislative procedure, the role of Parliament and the need for loyal cooperation between the institutions."
"I also agree with the rapporteur on his modifications to the Commission' s basic proposals."
"The Commission proposes a special tax, an abscissa of 50% with a threshold of 70%."
"Mr Katiforis proposes, firstly, to reduce this threshold to EUR 60 - a proposal which my group agrees with - and secondly, to offer the States which this directive is aimed at an alternative option: to apply the rate of 71%, including within this rate both special taxes and valued-added tax."
"I believe this is an innovative and important approach which respects the principle of price proportionality, which to a certain extent puts an end to the minimum threshold, and introduces a degree of clarity into indirect taxation."
"The accumulation of indirect taxes and value-added tax have been repeatedly condemned by this Parliament and this option - to establish a combined minimum level for the two taxes - seems to me to be a good solution."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that price plays a part in dissuading people from smoking, but it is not the only method, and we therefore expect the Commission to send us supplementary proposals soon, aimed at putting an end to this habit."
"I also agree that the price increase in coastal and border countries may lead to an increase in fraud."
"I would ask the Commission to strengthen the cooperation procedures in order to eradicate fraud, which is one of the elements that erodes indirect taxation, especially here, but we will talk about that later with Mr Bolkestein, in relation to the Kauppi report."
"Congratulations, Mr Katiforis."
"On this occasion you can count on the support of my group."
"Mr President, we feel that the Katiforis report on the proposal for a directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products is a good compromise on the Commission and Council' s proposal."
"Indeed, adopting the Commission' s proposal, we would ultimately have made the legislation too inflexible and created great difficulties, particularly for the manufacturing sector, with the result that the cost of national production - especially in southern Europe - would have increased and its quality decreased. There would also be an increase in smuggling, as has already been pointed out."
"In particular, we feel that the idea of a fixed amount minimum excise tax on cigarettes, as proposed, would not have protected - or rather, would have compromised - equality in the field of competition between very large and small and medium-sized tobacco companies, thus leading to distortion of the principle of competition."
"In our opinion, Mr Katiforis' report focuses on three goals."
"Firstly, the goal of tax harmonisation - it proposes a rate of 71% - in that VAT rates are made subject to a common rule for we are imposing a total tax for the first time: excise duties plus VAT; by taking this line, we will achieve greater convergence and avoid indiscriminate price increases and penalising the manufacturing industries of the Member States of southern Europe."
"Secondly, the goal of combating fraud and smuggling."
"Thirdly, it also achieves the aim of greater prevention of health risks, which is not obtained through continually increasing taxation but, we feel, especially through specific investment in research too."
"Lastly, we feel that the position on cigars and cigarettes as presented in the Katiforis report is more convincing in that it also avoids potential employment slumps, thus safeguarding the principles laid down in Article 127 of the Treaty."
"Therefore, Mr Katiforis, the Italian members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, European republicans, democrats, Italy of Values members and liberal socialists will support your report."
"Mr President, 22% of all cigarettes purchased in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are smuggled into the country."
"In the year 2000 smuggling of tobacco caused losses of GBP 3.8 million to the British Exchequer."
"Her Majesty's Customs and Excise have been able to cut the cross-Channel bootlegging of tobacco by an impressive 76% since March 2000."
"The bootleggers are up in arms at this, but now, with the Commissioner announcing his intention to take action against the United Kingdom for creating barriers to the free movement of goods, the door could be opened even wider to give smuggling an even greater field day."
"The cheap smuggled tobacco has produced new smokers among the young people in the United Kingdom."
"That is a tragedy."
"It has also threatened the few remaining jobs in the British tobacco industry."
"The British tobacco industry should have an even playing field with the tobacco manufacturers in the rest of the European Union and should not be penalised."
"Mr President, I and my delegation of British Conservatives welcome the rejection of the Commission's proposal in the previous vote in Parliament, and we regret the current proposal to accept the Commission's proposal, which is flawed."
"We will be supporting a number of Mr Katiforis' amendments because they make a bad proposal rather better."
"However, overall, we cannot give our support to this proposal because we do not believe in the upwards harmonisation of tobacco taxes."
"Tax is a matter for nation-states, for domestic governments, and should remain the preserve of domestic governments, which are democratically elected and democratically accountable, tax being one of the most fundamental aspects of nationhood and statehood."
"In addition, we are by no means convinced by the health arguments on smoking and tax."
"We are increasingly concerned that ever-spiralling levels of tax on cigarettes may lead to increased smuggling."
"Such illegal smuggling of cigarettes from outside the European Union is now causing a great deal of concern and may lead to an increase in smoking, certainly in my constituency and much of the United Kingdom."
"So the health issues in favour of high tobacco taxes are not clear cut but, even more importantly, we do not believe in the upward harmonisation of excise duties or, in particular, the upward harmonisation of tobacco taxes."
"Hence, we will be opposing the Commission's proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, smoking is dangerous both for people who smoke and for those in their vicinity."
"Even those who are not even born are harmed by the fact that their mothers or fathers smoke."
"Smoking is therefore very much a public health issue."
"We must therefore do everything to prevent people from starting smoking."
"I know what I am talking about, Mr Katiforis, for I, myself, have been a smoker."
"The words 'public health' do not even appear in the report."
"Mr Katiforis is a very intelligent and agreeable fellow MEP, but even intelligent MEPs are occasionally wrong."
"This time, Mr Katiforis is wrong."
"There is a lot of evidence to show that higher cigarette prices reduce the level of smoking."
"Less tobacco is consumed, and fewer young people begin smoking."
"In my country, the Public Health Institute has calculated that the one-off effect of the increase in cigarette prices in 1997 was to save 12 500 people from premature death, thanks to the fact that 100 000 people gave up smoking when cigarettes became more expensive."
"We are talking here simply about my own country, Sweden, which has only 9 million inhabitants."
"As is well known, taxes in Sweden are, moreover, significantly higher than in the EU generally."
"The arguments are therefore in favour of our being obliged to accept the Commission' s proposals."
"However, I do not believe it is sensible for the EU to support tobacco cultivation at the same time as great efforts are being made to prevent smoking and reduce the spread of cancer."
"We must be a little more consistent and not engage too much in double standards."
"I therefore hope that Parliament will support Mr Maaten' s amendment and, through it, the Commission' s proposal too, albeit in a somewhat stricter form."
"Mr President, I belong to the majority in this House that rejected the Commission's proposal in November, and I would actually have been quite happy to have left it at that, but now we are confronted by a second report that we have to vote on."
"Unfortunately, the Commission is sticking to its plan to raise the minimum rates of excise duties."
"Today's are on tobacco; according to my information, the Commission wants to introduce a proposal to increase excise duties and to abolish the zero rate on wine, even though it is a proven fact that wine drinkers are more intelligent and less prone to weakness of mind in old age."
"What else the Commission plans to cook up the day after tomorrow, I do not know."
"This proposal will not achieve the objective set for it, that is, the progressive convergence of excise duties in the internal market, and puts an unnecessary question mark against the balanced compromise achieved in 1992 under Luxembourg's Presidency between supporters of proportional and specific taxation."
"If this hapless proposal from the Commission were to be implemented, there would also be a massively greater risk of smuggling, especially in the countries of the South and in post-enlargement Central Europe, because the price of cigarettes there would increase by between 200% and 500%."
"As far as the campaign against tobacco consumption is concerned, which has to be pressed into service in justification of the Commission's exorbitant proposal, I can only reiterate that there is no proof whatever that cigarette prices slow down tobacco consumption."
"Far from it, smoking then even becomes a status symbol."
"In view of these considerations, I reject the Commission's proposal."
"The amendments introduced by our rapporteur, leaving it to Member States to choose between excise duty at EUR 60 per thousand cigarettes and excise duty plus VAT of 71% of the price, represent the lesser evil, and, politics being the art of the possible, I will, of course, follow the rest of my group in voting for Mr Katiforis' report with full conviction."
"Mr President, the new report brings the positions of the Commission and Parliament closer to each other and I welcome the efforts made by Mr Katiforis in that respect."
"His report now proposes to approve the Commission proposal subject to two amendments."
"The first amendment concerns the taxation of cigarettes and offers Member States a choice between two taxation systems."
"The Commission is, however, of the opinion that this will lead to less rather than more harmonisation of tobacco taxation."
"The option proposed would not oblige any Member State to change its level of taxation and would even make it possible for a number of Member States, including Member States applying relatively low tax levels, to lower their rates."
"This would be in clear contradiction to health policy objectives, as has been pointed out by Mrs Honeyball this morning."
"For this reason, the Commission cannot accept this first amendment."
"Moreover, it feels that one of the reasons why it is proposed - in particular the need to conserve the balance between specific and percentage taxation - is already taken into account in its proposal."
"As I explained previously, Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount in euro retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportion of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation."
"To justify the amendment, the report also points to the situation of candidate countries, for which the minimum duty level should be an achievable objective."
"But offering them a choice between two taxation systems after accession would leave us with a wide gap between their tax and price levels and the tax and price levels of the present Member States, resulting in substantial revenue loss for present Member States."
"The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries and has therefore proposed to the Council that limited transitional periods should be granted to candidate countries to reach the minimum rate of taxation."
"The second amendment rejects the change in the definition of cigars and cigarillos."
"However, the Commission remains of the view that products having the characteristics of cigarettes should also be taxed as cigarettes."
"That change was requested by a number of Member States and has the unanimous support of all the others."
"It has also received substantial support from the cigars and cigarillo industry."
"I would also like to comment upon the two other amendments adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The first one suggests adding a new recital, calling upon the Commission to submit proposals to eliminate fraud and smuggling."
"The Commission shares the view that rate harmonisation in itself will not eliminate fraud and also that other measures are required to combat fraud and smuggling."
"However, this does not need to be re-emphasised."
"A number of initiatives to combat fraud in the sector of excise products, have already been launched following the 1996 report of a High Level Group on fraud in the alcohol and tobacco sector."
"The most recent example is the Commission proposal of 19 October 2001 for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on computerising the movement and surveillance of excise products."
"It will be more appropriate to discuss the issue of fraud, which is a general issue relevant to all excise products, within the context of this proposal."
"The second amendment concerns the upper limit of the euro amount proposed by the Commission and suggests lowering the amount from EUR 100 to EUR 85."
"The motivation of the amendment is that EUR 85 is easier to achieve than EUR 100 for the applicant countries, which today apply excise duty levels between EUR 6 and EUR 24."
"I would point out that this upper limit is not relevant to applicant countries."
"It is only relevant for Member States already applying a very high amount of duty but which, in spite of this, do not meet the 57% minimum."
"In conclusion, I can say that the Commission sees this report as a step forward in comparison with the first report, as it endorses the need for enhanced approximation of rates of excise duty."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Mr President, once again it was quite impossible to hear the Commissioner's winding-up speech."
"It is totally unfair to our Commissioners who come here to address us after they have listened to our speeches."
"I wonder whether, at the start of this two-and-a-half years of your presidency, you might consider a five-minute break between the end of business and Members coming into this Chamber, because we cannot continue in this way, showing this discourtesy to our Commissioners."
"Mr Corrie, your point is well made."
"Your suggestion is one possibility."
"We also need to ask the huissiers to ensure that when Members enter the Chamber they are not engaged in conversation."
"Conversations are for outdoors."
"Vote"
"The next item is the vote."

"( After the vote on the Commission proposal)"
"Mr President, I wish to express the Commission's disappointment that the vote has gone against its wishes."
"The only thing that remains for me to do is to bring the result of this vote to the attention of the Commission, which will take due account of it and inform Parliament accordingly."
"Mr President, I have asked for the floor, when you have given it to the Commission, to say that what we have just rejected in this House is Mr Oostlander' s report, not the Commission' s proposal."
"We do not have the power to vote on the Commission' s proposal."
"We have rejected the report by Mr Oostlander, together with his opinion of the Commission' s proposal."
"You are quite correct."
"That is what I declared - that the report, as amended, was not adopted."
"The procedure that now takes place, if the Commission does not withdraw the proposal, is that we refer it back to the committee responsible without voting on the draft legislative resolution."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0011/2002) by von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the implementation of financial services legislation (2001/2247(INI))"
"Before the vote on Paragraph 13:"
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the new President of Parliament personally."
"I hope that he will have the patience to listen to me as the previous President used to."
"I have to tell you that I took part in the work of the Conciliation Committee establishing the working hours of mobile workers performing road transport activities."
"I discussed the matter with my friend, Mr Ugo Gustinetti from Alzano Lombardo in the province of Bergamo, who has worked as a driver all his life, and he said to me: 'What is much more important than rules is that there should be genuine monitoring of driving time' ."
"Therefore, I propose that the Galileo satellite system should be used to monitor all the vehicles moving in the European Union from the sky."
"Mr President, I wish to make an oral statement on the vote on the directive on working time in the road transport sector."
"My delegation welcomes the adoption of the directive."
"The improvement of road safety in general and greater protection for crew are both matters for concern across the whole of Europe and must therefore be regulated on an EU-wide basis."
"The latest events in connection with the hauliers' scandal in Luxembourg and in my homeland, Austria, have shown that there is much wrong in the transport sector."
"The plenary's adoption in January of the proposed regulation introducing an attestation for drivers was a proper indication of the desire to get the better of the illegal employment of third-country nationals."
"The directive that the plenary has adopted today represents another important step."
"The requirement to adhere to rest breaks and the laying down of maximum and night work times are making their contribution to safety on Europe's roads."
"It is for that reason that we voted for the adoption of the directive."
"It is, however, regrettable and disturbing that self-employed lorry drivers have not, for the time being, been included in the scope of the directive."
"That is a problem."
"It will probably give rise to new forms of pseudo self-employment."
"- (PT) The result achieved by the Conciliation Delegation is very positive and represents a very significant achievement for the European Parliament."
"By adopting this directive on the organisation of the working time of persons whose occupation is the performance of mobile road-transport activities, we will eliminate distortions to competition within the sector and at the same time promote road safety."
"I welcome, in particular, the agreement achieved on the central issue of this directive: the inclusion of self-employed workers."
"Including these workers within the scope of the directive seven years after its entry into force and the possibility of the Commission undertaking a study of the consequences of the exclusion of self-employed drivers, to be carried out two years before the end of that seven-year period, have proven to be a useful and balanced formula for overcoming the resistance of some Member States and thereby obtaining the agreement that is crucial to the adoption of this new directive, which is of vital importance to the common transport policy."
"The definition of a self-employed driver put forward in the directive also makes a valuable contribution to preventing the creation of new forms of false self-employment during the period of temporary exclusion of self-employed drivers."
"With regard to the hours of night work, guarantees are provided for the competitiveness of the outermost countries, whose drivers have to travel long distances in order to reach the main centres of production and distribution, travelling at night when traffic is less heavy."
"The outcome of the agreement between Parliament and the Council, therefore, represents an appropriate balance between the economic aspects and road safety and the health of workers."
". I am a supporter of the general principles involved in regulating working time, for the benefit of workers in terms of health and safety considerations and, in the case of road transport, for the road safety/accident prevention benefits that will be achieved."
"I do believe that regulations of this nature must balance the acknowledged benefits against the practical realities faced by transport operators, especially in rural and island areas where no viable alternative to road transportation exists."
"The concession on limitation to night working is important to Scotland, where long road distances are unavoidable and where transport operators already suffer such disincentives as high fuel taxation and relatively poor road networks in many areas."
"Rapport Ghilardotti (A5-0026/2002)"
"Mr President, Mrs Ghilardotti has documented the debate on the directive on consulting and informing workers in an excellent report, which I support."
"Moreover, I was sure she would do a good job, for Mrs Ghilardotti was Chairman of the regional council of Lombardy, the largest region in Italy, when I was a regional councillor, and this document will certainly help workers to take part in the life of the undertaking they depend on for a living."
"However, I would like to ask Mrs Ghilardotti, who, I regret, does not appear to be in the Chamber at the moment but who, I am sure, will read my explanation of vote, whether we cannot manage to achieve a directive which would require workers always to be informed of their pension rights as well."
". This directive will give valuable protection to many employees whose livelihoods are at risk, in particular due to the increasing ease with which companies relocate."
"It will not, of course, stop job losses but it will prevent situations from arising where employees read that they are being made redundant in the newspaper."
"It will also enable preparations for large-scale job losses to be made if they are inevitable."
"It does not adversely affect the 97% of companies with fewer than 50 workers that fall outside the terms of the directive."
"This final agreement is certainly not as strong as the Green/EFA Group wanted."
"Nevertheless, we will support the agreement because it is a major step forward in some states like the UK, which currently has no such protection for workers."
"We saw this in my constituency, Wales, when Corus made 3,000 steelworkers redundant, with disastrous effects on many communities and no prior consultation with the workforce."
"The six-year exemption unfortunately shows that the UK Government has learned nothing from that experience and workers in Wales will continue to be amongst the most vulnerable in Europe to job losses."
"I hope it will not take six years before all workers in Europe enjoy the same rights."
". A stark example of the need for improvement and the establishment of a common European framework for informing and consulting employees is occurring in my home area at this moment."
"A long established multi-national company - Levi-Strauss - recently gave advance notice of redundancy in relation to workers at two factories in Scotland, at Bellshill and Dundee."
"The news media were informed first, and the announcement was accompanied by a statement explaining that the company had unilaterally considered and rejected any possible alternative to closure."
"This type of action is deplorable, not helped by the fact that the UK is seen as having the weakest legislation in this area."
"I therefore welcome and support moves towards a reasonable EU-wide standard for proper consultation with workers."
"Rapport Oostlander (A5-0460/2001)"
"Mr President, I too voted against Mr Oostlander' s report, but this does not mean that I am against combating drug traffickers."
"We all agree that it is right to fight to eradicate the scourge of drugs from the face of the earth - not just from European territory - but if we do not restore our young people' s faith in values, including the values of politics, we will never succeed."
"Therefore, when will we decide, for example, to remove from bookshops a book by a certain Italian journalist named Mario Giordano, entitled 'L' unione fa la truffa' [The Union is a fraudster]?"
"It is unacceptable to sell books entitled 'L' unione fa la truffa' in European bookshops."
"I call upon the Presidency to take the necessary measures."
". I have been on record many times before and I would reiterate this call today that soft and synthetic drugs should not be legalised in Europe."
"I do not support the legalisation of ecstasy, cannabis or other synthetic drugs such as LSD or amphetamines."
"The UN Convention against the Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs prohibits the use, manufacture and distribution of ecstasy, LSD and amphetamines and this policy position must be fully upheld."
"I would like to say for the record that I did not register my vote today because there was a wholescale misuse of language put forward in various amendments which sought to fully confuse the key elements of the debate today."
"It is undeniably the fact that the use of these drugs causes damage to the user' s health."
"They can hardly be perceived as providing a positive function."
"I believe that the World Health Organisation has taken the correct approach on this issue."
"We cannot and must not support the creation of a drugs culture in our society by legally permitting the use of soft and synthetic drugs."
"For example, some people have put forward the proposition that ecstasy use should be deemed quite normal in society."
"I abhor this particular line of argument particularly in light of the fact that there has been a number of tragic deaths in Ireland and across Europe from the use of ecstasy."
"The long-term effects of the use of ecstasy are still very much unknown, other than we know that ecstasy is still a drug that can cause depression and memory impairment."
"While the European economy is performing strongly, we must also ensure that key social problems such as drug abuse are combated in a society."
"European initiatives to reduce the level of drug abuse in Europe must be supported at every opportunity."
"I do believe that the European Social Fund has played a key role in this regard in the past and must continue to do so."
"- (NL) Those who organise international trafficking in hard drugs are only concerned with making money on the back of the suffering of others."
"Proposals not only to lock these criminals up but also to strip them of their profits receive my support."
"Without these profits, they have no motive for continuing their harmful trade."
"Unfortunately, Mr Oostlander argues that, within his group, he is not one for splitting hairs in order to fight the thirteen amendments from the Left."
"Those amendments focus on organised cross-border crime, national competences and the consideration of therapeutic and personal use."
"In addition, he makes no secret of the fact that, in his view, the proposals are minimal, and he hopes that they will be further tightened up in future."
"Some see his proposals as a way of opening the door to ruthlessly combating the production, transport and use of soft drugs."
"This would lead to the criminalisation of the users, who would then need to make their purchases from criminals who trade in hard drugs."
"With regard to those amendments, I consider whether they contribute to the discouragement of soft drugs in a way similar to that employed in connection with other harmful, but legal, stimulants, such as alcohol and tobacco."
"The rejection of the improvements by the Left necessitates my rejecting the entire package, unfortunately including a few sound proposals made by the rapporteur."
". I wholeheartedly applaud the efforts to standardise the meaning of and define the penalties for drug trafficking."
"Essentially, this report represents a balanced, far-reaching, sensible and tough approach to a perennial problem which besets all Member States of the EU."
"For too long, the terms and conditions of what constitutes a drug trafficking offence have been too woolly, thereby creating serious pockets of crime in some parts of the world and within the EU."
"An additional welcome measure is the standardisation of penalties, with prison sentences with a maximum term of no less than five years."
"Once this law becomes enforceable, it should act as a real deterrent."
"Fines should only be used as an additional measure to prison sentences since otherwise they could lead to the belief that you can somehow pay your way out of a criminal offence."
"Lastly, I welcome the nuanced approach that the report takes vis-à-vis mitigating circumstances."
"For example, minors and those who have committed offences under physical duress, should clearly not be subject to the same penalties as all offenders."
"Report Ludford (A5-0436/2001)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we naturally welcome the proposal for a Council directive which is totally in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions, which stressed the need to finally put in place a policy for integrating third-country nationals."
"Having said that, we could not support the report."
"We regret that the proposal does nothing more than set out the conditions governing the residence of third-country nationals and that it does not, in any shape or form, establish a genuine European status for third-country nationals comparable to that of EU citizens."
"By the same token, family members must enjoy the same rights as the person they are joining. Yet, the way in which it is presented in the report, the right to live a normal family life, which is internationally recognised, does not take into account certain fundamental laws."
"Although the right to vote was, in principle, adopted in part, the conditions of application are not mentioned. Political rights are, however, an integral part of any integration policy."
"Fundamental rights are universal and if the universality of rights must be applied without exception, it should also apply to everyone, whether or not they are EU citizens."
"As for the criteria regarding resources and evaluating the stability of resources, would it not be better to offer all residents access to the labour market, rather than to confine some of them to exclusion?"
"Furthermore, there is no reason why students or persons that have been granted residence with subsidiary protection should be excluded from the scope of the proposal."
"Firstly, however, the concepts of public order and security, which are reasons for excluding persons from permanent status, require a common definition."
"Yet these concepts are now left to the discretion of the States or the competent authorities, which gives rise to serious discrimination, particularly towards third-country nationals."
"Lastly, with regard to procedures, the examination process takes six months, which is far too long."
"If the application is refused, a redress period, which does not exist, should be provided and this must have a suspensory effect, enabling any attempt at the expulsion of the person to be blocked, in the name of the right to self-defence."
"My final point is that the directive does not cover the millions of third-country nationals who are residing illegally, but who urgently need a political solution from Europe."
"The Union must therefore shoulder its responsibilities."
"To sum up, this report does not promote equality between citizens of the Union and citizens of third countries."
"The European status of a long-term resident does not exist."
"We must not therefore sanction this type of political approach."
"Mr President, Baroness Ludford' s report calls upon us to facilitate the movement within Europe of citizens who wish to stay here for at least three months of a six month period."
"The Pensioners' Party is for this and is pleased to see citizens of any other State travelling within Europe."
"In this regard, however, I feel we should distinguish between citizens who come to visit Europe with honest, noble intentions - Baroness Ludford belongs to the nobility so she, better than anyone, can understand that nobility must be valued - and the honest citizen is noble, and citizens with ignoble intentions."
"In other words, an open doorway for the new nobility of honest citizens but doors closed to the delinquents who, I am sad to say, are to be found everywhere, just like black sheep."
"The nobility, however, the new nobility of people with noble intentions, must be allowed to enter Europe."
"- (DA) The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament has abstained from voting in favour of the overall report because we are unable to support Article 5(1) of the Commission' s proposal."
"- (PT) This proposal for a directive has my vote because it represents a major step forwards and makes a valuable contribution to the creation of a more coherent Community policy in the field of immigration."
"It is an attempt to define the status of long-term resident, because we all recognise the need for the European Union to reach a compromise on harmonising the situation of citizens of third countries residing legally and permanently in a Member State, in which they must be guaranteed legal, economic and social rights on a par with those enjoyed by the Union' s own citizens."
"This status will be obtainable after five continuous years of legal residence, at the request of the interested party, who must have financial resources and sickness insurance, so that he or she does not become a burden on the Member State, and as long as the applicant' s behaviour poses no threat to public order or to domestic security."
"On the other hand, once this status has been granted, the individual will be guaranteed a set of rights, such as the right to work, to education, social security, healthcare and access to goods and services, etc., thereby making this a real instrument for integration into the society in which the individual lives."
"It is worth emphasising once again the importance of creating a more energetic policy for integration, which is crucial to promoting greater economic and social cohesion and to preventing discrimination and racism."
"Nevertheless, we must also stress the fact that genuine integration requires efforts on both sides."
"Furthermore, I welcome the series of procedural guarantees established in this proposal for immigrants who are anxious to be granted this status and which will enable us to prevent potential abusive behaviour by the competent authorities of the Member States."
"We voted against the Ludford report, which supports the Commission' s proposal to establish a single status for third-country nationals, who have been legally residing in one of the EU countries for more than five years."
"In our view, this idea is fundamentally flawed, as it will make the existing status uniform and more rigid, and deprive each Member State of any margin for manoeuvre in an area - namely, the presence of long-term foreign residents on its territory - which must, first and foremost, remain a matter for the national sovereignties."
"Secondly, we cannot give this proposal a legal basis without distorting the meaning of Article 63(3) and (4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which only provides for 'measures' regarding residence and not a 'status' in the full meaning of the word."
"It is true, however, that if the Treaty of Amsterdam had not been ratified, the weaknesses that the Commission is now exploiting would not exist."
"Lastly, we are seeing once again that, in practice, the Commission is using the concept of status as a lever to grant long-term resident third-country nationals (including refugees as well, for good measure) rights that are virtually equal to those of national citizens."
"Article 12 of the proposal for a directive lists the areas where equal treatment would be de rigueur, in other words, almost all of them, except the right to vote."
"This systematic equality is unjustified; although foreigners clearly have a right to receive benefits in return for having paid social security contributions, each nation must have the freedom of choice to decide whether to grant benefits that are funded from tax contributions."
"We wonder whether this desperate attempt to achieve equal treatment for all is one of the profound causes of the disaffection towards citizenship that is currently evident in our countries."
"We are in favour of full equal rights, including political rights, for everyone living and working in the European Union, whether citizens of a Member State or third-country nationals."
"The proposal for a Council directive sets itself a different objective altogether; amongst others, that of increasing the mobility and flexibility of the immigrant workforce within the European Union."
"Nonetheless, the proposal makes several improvements - which we have voted for - to the status of persons who originate from third countries and who are residing in the European Union."
"That said, the proposal aims to limit even these few improvements to long-term residents only, which we cannot adopt."
"It is even more difficult for us to adopt most of Parliament' s amendments, which further restrict the original text and have no other aim than to pander to nationalist, sovereign or xenophobic prejudices."
"We shall not vote against this text, because, in many ways, it improves the situation of certain third-country nationals who live and work in the European Union."
"But we refuse to give our backing to the numerous restrictions that it contains."
"We therefore abstained on the whole text, rejecting the particular amendments - that is, most of them - that would make the original text worse."
"It is a pleasure and a joy to see our fellow Member Baroness Ludford back at work."
"Since she was appointed a senior human rights specialist at the European Parliament, we can only remember the emblematic report that we voted on last March, which was dedicated to the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"She threw all her belief and all her effort into the task so that she would succeed in impressing upon us her passionate belief in 'anti-racism' ."
"Today, thanks to her impressive resilience, she has not disappointed; the active integration of third-country nationals will be achieved more quickly and to a greater extent and will be a useful weapon in the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"Baroness Ludford has reassured us and put our minds at rest."
"Her report is therefore presented as a list of duties."
"Duties that are, of course, reserved exclusively for the people of Europe."
"Therefore, third-country nationals who have been residing in an EU country for more than five years shall automatically acquire the status of long-term resident."
"The administration has mandatory powers to issue the resident permit which is valid for ten years and is automatically renewable (Articles 8 and 9 of the directive)."
"Once the status has been granted, Member States can only withdraw it under very restricted and specific circumstances."
"The legal certainty of the holder must be as high as possible."
"The holder can therefore be absent for a period of more than two years without having his long-term resident status withdrawn."
"The host Member State is obliged to grant to third-country nationals and their families, under the right to family reunion, the same rights as those granted to nationals, whether this is in terms of education, professional training, social protection, social assistance or tax."
"They can also enjoy additional welfare benefits, such as economic or cultural benefits, in order to enable them to integrate completely."
"To complete the picture, obtaining this status must constitute the first step towards being granted the nationality of the Member State in which they reside."
"This objective will fulfil the desire that Parliament has voiced on numerous occasions to see a multiracial, multicultural society flourish within the Community, where there could be no discrimination on grounds of race, gender, ethnic origin, religion etc."
"We are greatly looking forward to seeing Baroness Ludford welcome with open arms the several thousand refugees from Sangatte who are hoping to settle in England."
"Home, sweet home!"
"- (NL) If the measures for residents and visitors from outside had not been prepared before 11 September 2001, they would probably have been subject to a long delay due to the new fear of terrorism and lack of security."
"It is high time we tore down the last vestiges of statutory discrimination against a large proportion of our population."
"This discrimination affects people who, mainly in the 1960s, were attracted as 'guest workers' from Turkey or Morocco to come and fill the most unpleasant and worst paid jobs."
"Initially, their permanent residence was not taken into consideration by the six Member States of the then European Communities."
"After 40 years, many of these people from the first generation of migrants still do not have the nationality of their country of residence."
"For these people, there was no European unity for years."
"Unlike people with the nationality of a Member State, they were required to continue to comply with visa obligations in each separate Member State which they crossed in order to spend a holiday in their country of origin."
"The fact that they are now afforded more equal rights is unfortunately not so much the effect of indignation about the discrimination against them as it is a way of building one large European super state and of demonstrating that the old national borders have largely become defunct."
"- (DA) I have abstained from voting in the final vote on this report."
"I have done so because Denmark has a reservation in this area and not because I disagree with the intention behind the report or the directive."
"I would emphasise that I am in favour of giving rights to third-country nationals when they accept work in another EU country."
"Rapport Kessler (A5-0455/2001)"
"Mr President, this directive is not unlike the previous, noble directive of Baroness Ludford. As I see it, it discusses the possibility of movement, particularly for unemployed people who come to Europe to seek work - which is good - but also for pensioners and elderly people who wish to see the beautiful sights of our Europe."
"As representative of the Pensioners' Party, I would like to take this opportunity to call upon Parliament, in addition to allowing the movement of people who wish to visit our beautiful European countries, to do everything possible to make it easier for those elderly people who have worked for a lifetime and now, at last, have the time to dedicate to healthy, intelligent, educational, cultural travel round the beautiful sights there are to see in Europe."
"The Commission' s proposal on the movement of third-country nationals within EU countries for stays of less than three months is not restricted to harmonising conditions; it also aims to reduce certain controls in the name of 'freedom' ."
"This is the case, for example, with the 'reporting of presence' by foreigners under the Schengen Convention which I mentioned in yesterday' s debate."
"Even if this obligation to declare oneself was poorly applied, I was of the opinion that it was a matter of urgency to strengthen this obligation, rather than to weaken it."
"In another area, the Commission is also pursuing its former approach by proposing to introduce a 'specific travel authorisation' issued by a Member State which will apply in all the others, in order to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals for a period of less than six months."
"This reform is a good illustration of the subversive technique whereby a series of small steps can finally bring about the grand plan."
"As things stand, stays of more than three months are subject to national visas which fall within the sovereignty of each State."
"The 'travel authorisation' proposed by the Commission would erode this mechanism."
"In order to justify this derogation, on page 9 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the Commission mentions the case of certain foreigners who would need to move around the EU over a six-month period in their capacity as 'recipients of services' , such as 'tourists' or 'persons taking health cures' or even 'musicians' , as Commissioner Vitorino mentioned during the debate."
"This pretext is rather weak; hardly any tourists stay for six consecutive months in the EU and there is no justification for developing a directive specifically for them."
"The advantage for the Commission is elsewhere, namely the destruction of the coherence of a system based on national sovereignties in order to introduce a different kind of system, one that has supranational objectives."
"This dogmatic exercise will not bring any other benefits for our current area of priority, which is controlling migration flows and security."
"On the contrary, there is a danger that it will harm it, by encouraging weaknesses and inconsistencies to appear."
"Rapport Katiforis (A5-0016/2002)"
"Mr President, before I left for Strasbourg, I met my great friend and colleague, Mr Giuseppe Italia - that really is his name, the same as my country, Italy - and Giuseppe Italia, who lives in Cremona, said to me: 'I know that you are going to vote on this report."
"That is good, I am in favour of that."
"I am a chain-smoker and I am prepared to go out of my house to have a cigarette if there is someone indoors who does not like smoke."
"However, I am sixty-two years old: I don' t drink, I don' t have sex any more because ...' - he did not expand on this point - 'but, at least, leave me the pleasure of smoking cigarettes for I do not disturb anyone and I have no other pleasure left in life.'"
"Therefore, I voted for the motion: I am in favour of smoking in appropriate places and I am against increasing taxation on cigarettes."
"Mr President, after Mr Fatuzzo' s diverting speech, I would like to add my comments on the Katiforis report."
"I come from the south of Italy and I am sad to say that we continue, as always, to be badly served by airlines."
"I should have been in the Chamber for one of my reports - I am a shadow rapporteur - but I did not get here in time."
"In any case, I would like to point out here that this connection between smoking and health which we are continuing to make in resolutions on excise duties and State tobacco subsidies is inappropriate."
"There is clearly a connection between health and smoking but this is not the way to solve the problem."
"In southern Italy, particularly in Naples, contraband cigarettes are sold door-to-door and on the street: therefore, if we really want to boost the smuggling activity, the way to do it is to continue to wage war on this product."
"I would also point out that in some very poor areas with a high level of delinquency, such as the province of Caserta, tobacco succeeds in literally keeping3 000 workers off the breadline, and these jobs would be placed in extreme jeopardy."
"Congratulations, Mr Katiforis, on your two-fold resolution which the House has endorsed almost unanimously."
"Mr President, I should like to make a comment on the Katiforis report."
"I share the concern about the less privileged regions."
"I have the feeling that some States - and I am thinking of France, but do not rule out that there may be others - use the whole tobacco excise issue to put themselves in a good light abroad by adopting a progressive policy, that is to say a policy that promotes health and is against tobacco, while they actually devote too little attention to compensatory measures for their regions that rely on tobacco for a living."
"I also heard in Corsica a complaint similar to the one expressed by our fellow MEP."
"I therefore believe that those in Paris care little about the suffering in the regions in their concern to make us more healthy."
"Not by cutting down on sex, but by cutting down on smoking, Mr Fatuzzo."
"Rapport Van den Berg (A5-0464/2001)"
"Mr President, yesterday, I followed with great interest the debate on the reform of development cooperation policy and the debate with the Commission on the grey zone between relief and development cooperation."
"I fully concur with the report by Mr Van den Berg."
"I should like to stress that, wherever I go, I hear complaints from women in situ about the lack of involvement and the lack of participation in the practical implementation of reconstruction."
"In Somalia, for example, the women are on the spot but the men take the decisions in Kenya, far removed from reality."
"I therefore believe that the verbal concern about gender aspects is not sufficient."
"We must insist on women being actively involved in the field; they are sufficiently responsible to consider, and help assess, the way in which reconstruction should take place in practice."
"Relief, rehabilitation and development: pensioners and the Pensioners' Party are in favour."
"Indeed, they are so much in favour of this that I too, Mr Andria, was delayed in my plane journey to Strasbourg."
"Why is that?"
"Because I had to stall hundreds of pensioners - doctors, lawyers, architects and engineers - who, having learned of this report, wanted to leave immediately for developing countries to offer their services to help them, free of charge, with no remuneration, in the hope that this document would support, encourage and assist those elderly people and pensioners who so wish to continue to be useful after their retirement in the many developing countries."
"It was very difficult to dissuade them and I hope that, next time, they will have reason to applaud the European Parliament because it accepts their help."
"We voted in favour of this report for the sole reason that, if the European Parliament rejects the text, this should not serve as a pretext for making further cuts to emergency interventions that are granted to cope with natural disasters in poor countries, interventions which are already disgracefully low."
"By condemning the coordination problems alone, the report is, however, concealing the dreadful lack of resources."
"What is more, the report makes no mention of the fact that, despite the fact that natural disasters have equally disastrous consequences in poor countries, and that these countries are completely incapable of coming to terms with even the slightest of their consequences, this is because they do not have the material and human resources, such as hospitals, doctors and transport, and that they are so poverty-stricken from being plundered, both in the past and present, by the capitalist companies of the world' s most powerful countries."
"To speak of 'gaps' in 'international assistance' is utterly scandalous when referring to the most powerful countries, which restrict themselves to making purely symbolic gestures when they have to assist a poor country in coping with a natural disaster, but which, in fact, spend astronomical amounts on dropping bombs on a poor country such as Afghanistan (and many others before it)."
"Rapport Olle Schmidt (A5-0392/2001)"
"We have voted in favour of the report in view of the importance it attaches to transparency and environmental considerations."
"We would nonetheless make it clear that we are opposed to Paragraph 22, designed to make the ECB the EIB' s supervisory authority."
"Report Von Wogau (A5-0011/2002)"
"Mr President, Mr von Wogau could not fail to win the vote of Mr Fatuzzo and the Pensioners' Party on this major document on European finances, public finance and the financial market."
"Pensioners and the elderly like to keep abreast of money matters, of course, because they know the value of money after a whole lifetime of dealing with it."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express the great joy with which elderly people throughout Europe welcomed the introduction of euro notes and coins, the new currency; they feel as if they are in a fairy tale country, in a land of dreams where there is more money than before."
"I am sure that this European finance policy will bring pensioners and the elderly greater pensions, more money and greater well being. Europe is drawing closer to them."
"Before I explain why I voted for the report in question, I would like to draw your attention to Mr von Wogau' s major contribution to Parliament' s work as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I know he will be just as valuable as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"My heartiest congratulations!"
"The process of integrating the financial markets involves reshaping all the structures which supplement financial services."
"In this context, it becomes even more important to take note of experience gained in markets outside as well as within Europe in terms of organisation, operating procedures and the functioning of control measures."
"In particular, to this end, we need to introduce new telematic technologies to increase the efficiency of the securities markets."
"In fact, the use of these new instruments, which both allows the level of competitiveness between securities operators to grow and makes it possible to manage large volumes of transactions according to time frames and procedures which, until a few years ago, were unhoped for, has helped to raise the 'quality' of prices on these markets and to reduce brokerage costs."
"The implementation and integration of the securities markets must, however, be based on a more effective decision-making process - I refer here to the Lamfalussy report - which safeguards the interinstitutional balance while fully respecting all the levels of democratic control established and in operation."
"That said, the first thing we need to do is speed up and streamline the legislative process, adopting legislative acts at first reading where possible."
"Secondly, there must be an increase in transparency and provision of information, for these are an essential basis for the development of an integrated European securities market."
"The third improvement needed is consistency and clarity of procedures for both consumers and investors."
"We therefore need an information system to facilitate transactions, from the placing of orders through to payment."
"Lastly, it is vital to regulate the role of securities brokers."
"This should take the form of regulation of brokers and regulation of activities, in addition to establishing a new balance of supervisory powers in which Parliament' s powers are equal to those of the Commission."
"The report by Mr von Wogau on 'comitology' within financial services - namely, on the Commission' s introduction of implementing measures for legislation in this area - raises a number of very interesting questions, but, in our view, does not always provide the right answer."
"The starting point of the discussion is the current wording of Article 202 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which grants to the Council, and to the Council alone, the responsibility of delegating implementing powers to the Commission, which is contested by the European Parliament."
"It believes that, given the recent extension in its co-decision power, Parliament should now jointly decide the rules, as well as the implementing measures."
"The European Parliament is putting forward some excellent ideas in the von Wogau report, such as the automatic inclusion of a sunset clause in legislative acts, under which any delegation of powers to the Commission with a view to taking implementing measures would be suspended at the end of four years so that its appropriateness can be re-examined."
"On the other hand, Parliament is departing from its true role in wanting to verify all the implementing measures, and even 'to attend meetings of the Securities Committee as an observer' ."
"The Council traditionally enjoys two types of powers, executive and legislative."
"Due to its executive powers, Article 202 grants it a specific role in drawing up implementing measures."
"The same does not apply to the European Parliament, which has only a legislative role in applying the Treaties, and must not therefore be involved in everything."
"Nevertheless, the Commission clearly has a problem when it comes to supervising the drafting of the implementing measures."
"The European Parliament' s reaction may not be fully appropriate, but it has been triggered by a genuine reason."
"The next Intergovernmental Conference should respond to this by strengthening the role of the Council in the execution committees, and by strengthening the democratic scrutiny exerted over these committees: the scrutiny of the European Parliament over the Commission' s representatives, possibly, but also the scrutiny of sectoral assemblies made up of national parliaments, which would be exerted over the Council' s representatives."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.08 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Situation in the Middle East"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only my obligation, but also my desire, to begin by warmly congratulating you on your election last month to this extremely important post, which is a fundamental pillar of the European Union' s institutions."
"Mr President, I have said this in private, but please allow me to repeat it publicly."
"It is going to be a great pleasure for me to work with you, with the Presidency, and with Parliament, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever our complicated agendas allow it, I will be very happy to attend Parliament to explain the important actions the European Union is taking in the field of security and foreign policy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been asked to attend today to speak essentially about the Middle East and that is what I will focus on, but I would also like to take this opportunity to exchange a few words with you on the situation in Afghanistan and the Balkans, where - we must not forget - we have very serious commitments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the first term I am going to use when talking about the situation in the Middle East is frustration."
"For those of us, like myself, who have spent years trying to find a formula for resolving the problems of the Middle East, the situation we are in can only be described, both from a personal point of view and from that of the parties involved, as highly frustrating."
"I first became involved in the problems in the Middle East at the Madrid Conference, which was the driving force that demonstrated that we needed a formula essentially based on the idea of 'peace for territory, territory for peace' and which subsequently gave rise to the Oslo process, which brought results, but not all the results we wanted, and which suffered from the enormously tragic assassination of Prime Minister Rabin."
"Today, unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot talk of a peace process, since there is neither a process nor any peace."
"My first comment, ladies and gentlemen, is therefore to say how much I, as a person involved, regret the consequences of this lack of a peace process, as do the people who are suffering on both sides."
"Should we be pessimistic then?"
"I would say not, and despite all the frustration, despite everything that is happening, we must retain a certain degree of optimism and a sense of future possibilities."
"I believe that the European Union is performing its task correctly by not throwing in the towel."
"We must stick vehemently to our principles and our commitment to this process."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must not just defend and help the Middle East peace process because of the principles and values which inspire the European Union, but also because, in this globalised world, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, is our home territory."
"We cannot conceive of a stable Europe, a progressive Europe, without a Mediterranean and a Middle East which are also progressing."
"It will be very difficult to achieve a stable and peaceful Europe, which is worthy of the status of a great world actor, if we are not also capable of having a Mediterranean which is peaceful, tranquil and prosperous."
"Please allow me to say that, since I had the opportunity and the privilege to work on the drawing up of the Mitchell report, almost a year ago now, there have been many, too many, missed opportunities."
"Too many moments when something could have been done and it was not."
"Too many occasions when progress could have been made and it was not."
"The European citizens and we in Parliament, their legitimate representatives, must collectively commit ourselves to never again allowing an opportunity to be missed."
"At this point there are certain opportunities which I would like to mention to you."
"But please allow me to go a little, not into the broader story, since we have had the opportunity to discuss that on several occasions in this House, but into more recent history."
"Please allow me to return to December of last year."
"On 10 December, I was in the Middle East."
"I was able to be there and talk to all the political leaders."
"I also met with General Zinni, the representative of the United States there."
"There was a tough stage, as you will remember, but later there was also a moment of hope."
"And we must recognise that, thanks to the effort of Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the representative of the European Union in situ, we achieved, from around 10 December, the most significant moment of peace for many, many months, which lasted until the middle of January."
"There was opportunity during that period, the most significant demonstration of which was the speech by President Arafat on 16 December."
"You will remember perfectly that on 16 December President Arafat made a speech in his own language, broadcast by television stations, as requested by the Members of the European Union, in which he called for a cease-fire, for peace and for the terrorist groups to stop their violent acts on behalf of the Palestinian Authority."
"As I have said, there were a few days of peace, of hope, which were related to the Christmas celebrations. Even when President Arafat himself was not authorised to go to Bethlehem to celebrate Christmas."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, since 10 January we have a situation similar to the previous one."
"First of all violence broke out amongst Palestinians in one of the settlements, later Israeli forces murdered an important member of one of the Al Fatah groups and later there was the incident involving the vessel, the Karim A. I would like to talk about both things very briefly."
"It was a terrible tragedy that violence should have broken out again in January."
"Because we had passed that crucial period of seven days of total calm and the opportunity was not taken to make a qualitative jump forward."
"I remember, and I will never forget, how, in Tel Aviv airport, on 6 December, late at night, together with the United States' representative, General Zinni, we were thinking about the plan to implement the Tenet plan and the implementation of the Mitchell plan."
"We had agreed on a trilateral meeting between the Palestinian, Israeli and United States security services and subsequently a bilateral meeting between the Palestinians and the Israeli forces."
"Terrorism and violence from both sides destroyed the opportunity we had over those days."
"And it was complicated - as I said previously - by the famous episode of the Karim A. Please allow me to stop a moment and explain to you what the famous Karim A has meant."
"As you know, the ship, which contained arms of a higher calibre than those normally used by the Palestinians, also had a strategic value for the Israeli leaders and for the United States, since it was the beginning of the relationship, not yet finally proved, but very possible, between 'somebody' in the Palestinian Authority and Iran."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and Iran has been practically non-existent for many years."
"If that relationship comes to be proven, it would significantly change what we might call the Middle Eastern landscape."
"There is no firm proof which I have been able to see physically, but there is no doubt that something of that nature has taken place."
"As you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, all of this has led to an increase in the already significant distrust between the two parties."
"If Camp David represented a break in the trust between the two parties, the situation of the early days of January this year have lead to huge further increase in that distrust."
"What can we do from now on?"
"How can we try to resolve the situation?"
"Remember the famous European Union declaration in Laeken, in the final days of December."
"It assigned clear responsibilities to the two parties and I believe it is one of the best declarations made by the European Union."
"We must continue in this direction, which was the one taken by the last General Affairs Council."
"That Council, as well as making that declaration, sent me to the United States to try to find a common position between the European Union and the United States, above all in relation to the situation of the Palestinian Authority."
"As you will remember, President Arafat is practically a prisoner in Ramallah and the Israeli authorities are still claiming that the Palestinian Authority has become unnecessary and irrelevant."
"You know that that is not the European Union' s position and that we believe we should maintain the Palestinian Authority and its President, for various reasons: firstly, because it has been elected by the Palestinian people and, secondly, because we firmly believe that there will be no military solution to this conflict and that therefore the only possible solution is dialogue, and that dialogue requires negotiators, and the negotiator elected by the Palestinians are the members of the Palestinian Authority, headed by President Arafat."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are maintaining that position."
"And I have had the opportunity over recent days - I have spent the whole week in New York talking to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and in Washington with Vice-President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell and the President' s adviser, Condoleezza Rice - to try to discover whether we are able to give further joint impetus in the face of this terrible situation in the Middle East."
"I believe that these visits have some consequences."
"I do not want to talk about the influence of any one party, or the influence the European Union, but I will restrict myself to describing the facts."
"Last Wednesday night when I was in the United States, Prime Minister Sharon, for the first time since saying that he would never again hold contacts with the Palestinian Authority, received three very important Palestinian leaders in his private residence: the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Ala; the person who is considered to be the number two in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Abu Mazen; and Mohamed Rachid, who is considered to be one of the most important people in the financial world within the Palestinian Authority."
"For the first time, Prime Minister Sharon received these people in his house."
"I can also tell you that yesterday and today Secretary of State Powell has received Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Parliament, in Washington."
"In other words, we are at a point where we can once again say that there is a tiny glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel."
"The aim of all this effort is to try to recover a political perspective."
"We can and must continue to fight against violence."
"We must continue to condemn terrorist attacks, but we must also be capable of giving the conflict a political perspective."
"That was the spirit of the Mitchell report. That was the spirit in which I participated as a representative of the European Union, and that is the spirit which must inspire all of us."
"That is where we stand, ladies and gentlemen."
"I cannot tell you at this point that I have great hope."
"I have a little bit of hope."
"I began by saying that I was very frustrated, but I can also see that there is some possibility that we may inch forward a little."
"Any movement in the right direction is worth trying, however small it may be."
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know how many of you have been there recently, but the situation, from the citizens' point of view, is truly horrendous."
"It usually took me twenty minutes to get from Jericho to Ramallah. At the moment it may take me three hours to make the same trip, owing to military and police controls."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union is doing all it can to try to bring a little hope to this process."
"I believe that the European Union must continue to work in conjunction with our friends in the United States, as well as the King of Jordan and President Mubarak."
"A few hours ago I was with the King of Jordan, I also spoke a few hours ago with President Mubarak on the telephone and I have spoken to President Arafat this morning, and there is, as I have said, a little hope."
"I cannot say that there is a lot. We still have the rest of the week to carry on working."
"At the weekend, as you know, the Foreign Affairs Ministers will meet at Gymnich to deal almost exclusively with the issue of the Middle East."
"What political initiatives can we bring to the table?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to participate in what I believe should now be our course of action: to help, to contribute to the successful outcome of the process of dialogue which has begun between the President of the Parliament of the Palestinian Authority and the Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Peres."
"As you know, the negotiation mechanism which has now begun is as follows: to try, as soon as possible, to have the Palestinian State recognised, before the definitive borders are recognised."
"The idea is that the bases of the negotiation should be the 1967 borders, with exchange of territories if necessary, in order to compensate for some of the possible difficulties."
"To try not to enter at this point into a discussion of the more difficult issues: Jerusalem and the return of the refugees; and to begin to work with the mutual trust of two States which already recognise each other, although the second is not complete."
"This is the idea we are working on. I cannot guarantee success."
"I must also tell you, very frankly, that Prime Minister Sharon told me that for him that was not the perfect solution but that he was going to let the Foreign Affairs Minister continue with the negotiation."
"That is to say that we cannot be sure that in the end the government of Prime Minister Sharon is going to accept it."
"But I believe we must continue working in that direction."
"If there is no change, even the slightest change, in the current situation, the violence will continue to dominate the centre of the debate."
"And we must be able to prevent violence being at the centre of the debate, since politics must be there."
"I insist once again: this problem can only be resolved politically, by means of dialogue, and, therefore, sooner or later - let us hope that it is as soon as possible - arms and violence must disappear so that politics can prevail."
"There is no other solution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, just a few days ago, Simon Peres spoke in a restricted sitting of the General Affairs Council to the fifteen ministers and told them something which meant a lot to me, due to the way he expressed himself and the emotion with which he said it."
"He said more or less as follows: ""I will never be in a government which does not have the objective of two States: Palestine and Israel."
"For a dreamer such as I, Simon Peres, who is very old and has always worked to achieve peace, it is impossible to imagine a situation in which there are not two States."
"If there are not two States, two negative things will happen, which I could not accept: one, Israel would not be a democratic State because we would be imposing ourselves on the Palestinians, or, on the other hand, Palestinian demography would win out and the State would not be a Jewish State ""."
"For all of these fundamental and profound reasons, which he expressed with great emotion, we must carry on fighting for two States, quickly, on the basis of the agreements of the United Nations Security Council, the two resolutions, and on the basis of those approaches which I referred to earlier."
"Will we have success immediately?"
"There is no guarantee of that."
"Is there the will to make every effort to do so? Yes."
"I can assure you that there is."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, neither the European Union nor anybody has a miraculous solution."
"To carry on working with the United Nations, with the United States, with Egypt, with Jordan, is - I believe - the best way to try to make progress in that direction."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we are doing."
"You can rest assured that both Miguel Ángel Moratinos and I will be working 24 hours a day, whenever necessary, to try to resolve this conflict, which is of profound concern to the Europeans."
"We are not talking about a distant problem, but a problem which is physically, geographically, close and which we feel in our hearts and in our heads."
"It is therefore our obligation to continue doing it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, please allow me very briefly to mention two issues which I had been asked to mention."
"The first is Afghanistan."
"Commissioner Patten will have more information to offer you, because it is he who has represented the European Union at the Tokyo meeting in a most dignified manner."
"I just wanted to say that we have a personal representative of mine in Kabul, and I am also rather proud to say something that we are not always able to acknowledge: the military forces defending Kabul at the moment, supporting the government which was approved at the Bonn Conference - also a European city - are mostly European forces."
"Thirteen European Union countries have forces deployed there."
"I believe we have to say this very clearly: we must be proud that the people who are carrying out the peace and stabilisation process in Kabul are basically citizens of our countries."
"Secondly, I will tell you that we have to work, and that we will do so in very difficult political circumstances during the remaining time between now and June, when, as you know, the Assembly will once again have to name the Grand Assembly which will have to meet to elect another government, which will not be easy."
"The present government has a certain degree of balance."
"To change those balances will not be easy, but it will certainly have to be done."
"Therefore, between now and June we will have to work very intensively with the representatives of Afghanistan and also the other three fundamental countries."
"Firstly, Pakistan."
"Yesterday, both Chris Patten and I were with the Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister."
"I believe that they are doing a fantastic job and we should congratulate them on it."
"Secondly, Iran, the other key country for the stability of the region."
"We must recognise that, regardless of what is said or what can be said about Iran, its representatives behaved constructively in both the meeting in Bonn and the meeting in Tokyo."
"I believe that we must work with them."
"And thirdly, Russia."
"These three countries are crucial to the external stability of Afghanistan."
"We are doing so and we are going to continue to do so, in order to try to ensure that this process, which will begin in June, and which was launched at the Bonn meeting, yields results."
"The other issue I wanted to mention, very briefly, Mr President, is that of the Balkans."
"I would like to focus on three points, which in my judgment are the hottest, or potentially the hottest issues."
"The first relates to the FYROM, Macedonia and Skopje."
"I believe that, after the agreements signed in Ohrid, we are in an ideal situation, from a political point of view."
"The whole Constitution was changed and a few days ago the Law on Local Governments was approved, which was a fundamental element in terms of being able to implement the return and entry of police into areas they had been expelled from some months ago."
"We are therefore moving in the right direction."
"The situation is still not perfect, but I believe we will be able to spend the Spring in peace and calm."
"At this moment, NATO military forces, led by Germany, are still there."
"The government has accepted an extension for another three months, which may become six."
"The European Union is considering the possibility of treating them as an actual European Union responsibility in the future."
"No decision has been taken, but it is being considered and therefore, in relation to Skopje, although this is not a time for great celebrations, I believe that things are moving in the right direction."
"The Conference of Donors, which Chris Patten will refer to, may work and may be a considerable help from an economic point of view."
"Secondly, in Kosovo, as you know, there were elections which we should all be satisfied with."
"The elections took place very calmly, with no violence, and the Serbian minority also participated in them."
"They are now the second largest force in the Assembly."
"What is happening now, at the beginning of February, is that they have not yet been able to reach agreement, and remember that the elections took place in November."
"They have not yet agreed either on electing the President, which really should be President Rugova, or on forming the government."
"It also happens that the representative of a European MIC, which will continue to be European, had to leave for personal reasons and we have had a few weeks of vacuum."
"I was there trying to give a little impetus to the negotiations, which are absolutely essential, so that Rugova, who does not have the majority to govern, can do so with the others."
"Let us hope that over the next few days we will have an Assembly with a government in place, with the Presidency elected which has the ability to confront the real problems that that government will have to deal with."
"The last point I would like to make relates to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"As you know, the talks between Podgorica (Montenegro) and Belgrade broke down on 24 October."
"I was called by Kostunica and by Yukanovic, to see whether we were able to keep those talks alive."
"We have managed it and we are continuing to work, to negotiate and to facilitate those talks as the European Union."
"I am going there as often as I can to talk to each of them."
"We will meet again on Sunday, when we will have another meeting to see whether it is possible, by means of constitutional reform, to prevent the referendum and the separation of Montenegro from Belgrade."
"We are working very intensely on that: there is total consensus between the Member States of the European Union that we should make every effort to achieve that objective."
"There were certain doubts over whether the United States would take the same approach or not."
"After spending this week dealing with their leaders, I can tell you that they are taking the same approach and they are prepared to help us to achieve this reform of the Federation' s Constitution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end - and I believe, Mr President, that I have almost exceeded my speaking time, since I was told 30 minutes and this is my twenty-seventh minute - by referring once again to my first point: the Middle East."
"There is no doubt that it is, and must continue to be, our main concern."
"The European Union has great responsibilities and we must continue to work in that direction."
"It will not be easy, but we must not throw in the towel and we must continue to be resolute and determined."
"We will win this battle."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this is the first time I have spoken in a debate with you presiding."
"It is not just the half of me that is Irish which welcomes your presence in the Chair - all of me welcomes your presence in the Chair."
"I wish you well for a very successful presidency."
"I am sure we can count on it being not only successful but also remarkably eloquent."
"I have one potential confession: If I have to slip away for a couple of minutes during the course of the debate, it will be just to do my democratic duty in another place, where one of the Union's great institutions is meeting and discussing important matters relating to competition policy and other things."
"I will only do that if I have to and will return straight away to the debate."
"The whole Parliament knows how tirelessly my friend and colleague, Mr Solana, has worked to restore some semblance of hope in the bloody shambles of the Middle East peace process, and to sustain the progress that the Union has undoubtedly made in bringing stability and hope to south-east Europe, and to the western Balkans in particular."
"I have an admirable speech, which goes over all the issues which the High Representative covered so extraordinarily well."
"In order not to offend the intelligence of Parliament and to ensure that as many Members can take part in the debate as possible, I will not simply cover the issues which Mr Solana has covered with such knowledge and passion."
"I will just underline the strength of my agreement with everything the High Representative has said."
"He has pointed out the missed opportunities - one after another - which have brought so much savagery and violence to the region, beginning with the failure to implement the Mitchell report, and going on to the failure to respond with adequate generosity of spirit to the speech made by Mr Arafat on 16 September."
"He has touched on some of the appalling errors which have disfigured the history of the region, including the Karine shipment. What we have seen is a descent into violence: killings provoking more killings, violence, repression, senseless destruction."
"As the High Representative said, we do not have a Middle East peace process any more but - to use a phrase from a New York magazine a few weeks ago - a bloody feud."
"We have to remain engaged in order to try to restore some hope, and the High Representative set out some of the things the European Union is doing to press the case for peace and for a political settlement."
"There is one thing on which I should like to focus - which the European Union has been doing and which is sometimes decried. We have been supporting the Palestinian Authority, and our support for the Palestinian Authority has first of all made certain that there is still a viable negotiating partner for the Israeli government."
"Secondly, it has made sure that there has not been a descent into anarchy in the Palestinian territories - because let us be clear that the alternative to a Palestinian authority is Palestinian anarchy."
"What is the alternative to the substantial commitment we have made?"
"In the last two years, we have spent about EUR 400m from the Community budget in the Palestinian territories, and that money has been carefully vetted month by month, in particular the contributions we make to the Palestinian Authority, to ensure that it is not spent on purposes of which this Parliament would not approve."
"It must be said that if the accountants of Enron had been one-hundredth as diligent as the IMF is, month by month, in looking at how our money is spent in the Palestinian territories, a lot more people would still have jobs and pensions to look forward to."
"When one looks at that commitment and sees the extent to which projects we have started and others in which we have invested money have been destroyed, wilfully and purposefully, it is enough to make one literally weep."
"We have seen the destruction of projects worth about EUR 17m in which the European Union has invested - that is, just over a tenth of the total destruction of infrastructure which has been identified by the World Bank."
"And the World Bank argues, though this must be a very rule-of-thumb figure, that the Palestinian national income has been reduced by about USD 2.4bn as a result of what has happened over the last months."
"I ask myself, and I ask Parliament: where is the evidence that any of that increases security?"
"(Applause)"
"Where is the evidence that going back twice to destroy the forensic laboratory that we had been asked to provide for the Palestinian security services increases security in the Territories?"
"Where is the evidence that destruction of a sewage pump increases the security of Israel and Israeli citizens - something which I wholly understand they are passionately concerned about?"
"Where is the evidence that taking bulldozers to the runway in Gaza airport is a contribution to the security of Israel?"
"We all know that sort of destruction of infrastructure, health and education services, people's livelihood and jobs destroys hope and any prospect of political stability and security."
"The High Representative referred to what we are doing in Afghanistan and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Why is Europe spending EUR 600m this year in Afghanistan - EUR 200m from the Community budget?"
"We are doing that not just out of humanitarian motives, but also to try to ensure a more stable and secure future for the people of Afghanistan."
"We know that economic development and social progress help contribute to political stability and to greater security."
"That is why we are making that investment in Afghanistan and why, so far, the European Union, the Member States and the Commission have pledged about 45% of what the World Bank and the UNDP say is going to be needed in Afghanistan over the next five years."
"I hope some others - the United States, Japan, Saudi Arabia - will be as generous as we have been in the next few years."
"Why are we spending what we spent in the Balkans, in FYROM, for example?"
"In the last few months, with the reconstruction agency starting to do as good a job in FYROM as elsewhere in the region, we have already repaired 400 houses, there will be 300 more repaired by April; electricity has been restored in Aracinovo; water and electricity are restored in Kumanovo."
"We have made a considerable contribution to restoring normality to Macedonia and will keep on doing that."
"Again, why?"
"Not only because of a humanitarian impulse but also because we know from our experience in Europe that there is a relationship between economic stability and political stability and security."
"I do not labour this point as a sort of demented chartered accountant."
"I make these arguments because they are so obviously true."
"We know they are true from our experience."
"If you make people unemployed, if you destroy any infrastructure for people's social well being, then what you are doing is not only making their lives miserable but also, almost certainly, making sure that everyone's lives become more violent."
"I hope that even now in the Palestinian Territories and in Israel more people will be prepared to listen to the moderates, to those who made their views about the future so bravely known at Kalandria checkpoint before Christmas."
"I hope that the Voice of Peace movement will be listened to because the people who argue in that brave way for peace are the only ones who really chart a way forward for the Middle East, for the Palestinian State in the future, and for Israel."
"Anybody who does not believe that should ask Members of this Parliament; should ask somebody like Mr Hume what helped to produce peace in Northern Ireland."
"It was moderates being prepared to stand up for their beliefs, it was moderates having the courage and decency to go out there and argue for what we all know is the only way in which you turn off the violence and turn on the peace and security."
"Look at what has happened in South Africa, which the Voice of Peace Movement from the Middle East has recently been visiting - exactly the same process occurred there."
"So in endorsing everything which the High Representative has said, I just wanted to ask this question: how many more people have to die before the voices of the moderates who are left in the Palestinian Territories and Israel are actually listened to by the citizens of those communities?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September and subsequent action taken in Afghanistan and the current situation in the Middle East, have pushed into the background a matter that both Mr Solana and Mr Patten have mentioned, namely a peaceful settlement in Macedonia."
"I wish to say a word of thanks to Mr Solana, the High Representative and also to Commissioner Patten, but also to all the others who have played their part there in making Macedonia peaceful today."
"This is a gigantic success for the European Union, for which our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks you."
"In these days and weeks, we are looking eastwards."
"We expect there to be new countries in the European Union in the next few years."
"I will, though, say quite emphatically and underline what the High Representative said, that it is important to our security in Europe that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we, as Europeans, cooperate peacefully and well with all the countries of the Mediterranean region."
"We will also state that, when these problems are under discussion, we must first just put people on centre stage."
"We state quite clearly that the life and human dignity of a Christian and a non-Christian in Europe, the life of a Jew, an Israeli in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and the life of a Palestinian, of a Muslim in Ramallah or the Gaza Strip are of the same value, and no distinction must be made between human rights in Europe, in the Islamic world or anywhere else on this earth."
"(Applause)"
"We wholeheartedly agree with both Mr Solana and also Mr Patten in declaring our need of dialogue and of partnership."
"These involve us telling the truth and not going along with irresponsible language."
"When, for example, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says, in Thursday's issue of 'Maariv' - and I am quoting him verbatim: 'In Lebanon' - that is, in 1982 - 'it was agreed that Arafat was not to be eliminated."
"To tell the truth, I regret that we did not eliminate him.' - that is irresponsible language."
"That is the sort of language that leads to war; it is not the sort of language that brings about reconciliation."
"(Applause) I find it difficult, even in view of my nationality - and I was born after the war - to say this here."
"I find it cynical of the Israeli Prime Minister to respond to our criticism of his attitude by speaking of a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe."
"No, we are not anti-Semitic."
"We want Israel to live in peace within secure borders."
"In that, we stand alongside all Israelis."
"This has absolutely nothing to do with anti-Semitism."
"We reject that appellation with all the decisiveness we have."
"(Applause)"
"We have, of course, demands to make of Yasser Arafat."
"He wrote a remarkable article in the 'New York Times' a few days ago."
"In it he says that he intends to redouble his efforts against terrorism from the Palestinian side, thus expressing the possibility that he might not have previously done all that was necessary."
"So we also call on Yasser Arafat to do more in this respect in the places where he has influence, knowing as we do that he does not have all the Palestinian groupings under his control."
"Mr Solana also mentioned the weapons shipments on the Karine-A."
"We too want to have information on who they were intended for."
"We urge Arafat to provide information on this."
"I believe that we Europeans have, along with the Americans, a great task ahead of us."
"The Americans, though, must also understand that they have to give Israel and Palestine equal treatment, and that both sides have the same dignity."
"Secretary of State Powell, in an interview a few days ago, spoke of Palestine's right to exist, its right to be a state."
"All this we welcome."
"I think that we, Europeans and Americans together, now have a common task, to contribute to peace in that region."
"Yasser Arafat is, of course, the elected President of Palestine."
"If we do not accept him as a partner in dialogue, then there can be no peace and no dialogue."
"We therefore call on Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat to make a start on peace by talking to each other so that people in the region, in the Middle East, can have a future worthy of human beings."
"All those who promote that, such as Javier Solana, Chris Patten and others, have the full support of our group."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, High Representative, I too want to welcome the Commissioner, who will shortly be returning to the Chamber."
"I wish to start by joining with Mr Poettering in what he said on behalf of his group, and also, on behalf of our group, express our thanks for the success of the policy on the Macedonian issue which the High Representative and the Commissioner conducted last summer."
"The press is, unfortunately, always full of the things that are not going well in Europe, but when a policy is successful, it is virtually ignored."
"I want to focus my remarks on the Middle East."
"I am dismayed by the figures the Commission has published on the destruction recently meted out to projects funded by the European Union."
"The point here is not the fact that something is being destroyed, but rather the reason why it is being destroyed."
"The Israeli government is attempting to wreck whatever might become the infrastructure of a future Palestinian state, and that is something we cannot accept."
"You were saying today, Mr Solana, that what is going on there is not a peace process."
"I agree with you wholeheartedly."
"I have been saying in this House for a year and a half that we should no longer use the word 'peace process' ."
"It is a low-intensity war, but a war all the same, and our task is to put a stop to it and attempt to restart what will become a peace process."
"We are, though, still a long way from doing that."
"Mr Solana, I fully support your statement that the EU must carry on, for we have no alternative."
"As has repeatedly been said, though, Israel does not want us as mediators."
"Perhaps you will again be accepted and welcomed there, with an opportunity we are rarely given to present our policies and our proposals."
"Are we then to finance projects only to see the Israeli government's tanks destroy them?"
"I also consider the recognition of a Palestinian state to be very important, indeed, as Mr Poettering has said, the only possibility."
"A President has been elected for this Palestinian state, and that is something Mr Sharon cannot ignore any more than we can."
"He is the only person we can negotiate with."
"I do not believe there are many other potential partners in dialogue on the Palestinian side."
"I regret, Mr Solana, my inability to share even in your modest optimism."
"For one and a half years, we have been looking on while two utterly unequal opponents wage war on each other."
"We look on while Israeli tanks destroy Palestinian homes and kill Palestinian civilians and we also watch as Palestinians kill themselves and take equally innocent Israeli citizens with them."
"It goes without saying that we condemn all violence and every terrorist act without 'ifs' and 'buts' ."
"Where, though, does it get us?"
"We achieve no progress by it, and so, Mr Solana, we and the Commission as well, have to think in terms of using the powers we have by reason of the association agreement with Israel, even to the extent of suspending it."
"High Representative, Commissioner, you have the dubious fortune to live in interesting times, as the Chinese might say."
"You may be the architects of the Union's awakening in foreign policy."
"I welcome the meetings that Mr Sharon had last week with Palestinian leaders."
"I regret that it is the first time since he came to power that he has directly engaged with the Palestinians and I hope it is not mere coincidence that the talks come just before his trip to Washington DC."
"But it will not be enough to talk about a cease-fire."
"We need to be talking about an Israeli pullback and an end to the destruction of EUR 17 million worth of EU-funded Palestinian infrastructure."
"I recommend, High Representative, that if we want peace we do not define any starting date."
"Nonetheless, the news that some Israeli reservists are reportedly refusing to serve outside the 1967 frontiers is a welcome development."
"After all it was similar pressure from reservists that led to Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon and, taken together with Arafat's expression of willingness of the Palestinians to end the conflict and the need to find creative solutions, these green shoots of optimism need to be nurtured and encouraged to grow."
"High Representative, you spoke of the Mitchell report and light at the end of the tunnel."
"I hope this is not the headlamp of an oncoming train."
"Sometimes America's friends - or so-called friends - in the Middle East have been about as helpful to the peace process as the so-called loyalists in Northern Ireland have proven loyal to the UK Government."
"The Union has a serious dilemma if it believes that US policy on the Middle East is damaging the entirety of Western interests."
"I wish you wisdom and courage in your discussions with our friends on the other side of the Atlantic."
"High Representative, you spoke also about Afghanistan."
"My group is concerned about reports of interfactional fighting in Northern and Eastern Afghanistan, leading to thousands of Pashtuns fleeing villages, reports of 50 or more people being killed in Gardez."
"Such reports are an ominous sign and strengthen the case for an international stabilisation force to prevent any possibility of a slide to civil war."
"Our priority would be to complete the elimination of terrorist networks but in this regard we believe that whatever questions there are over the status of combatants held by the US in Afghanistan and in Guantanamo Bay, they should be treated consistently with the 1949 Geneva Convention."
"(Applause)"
"That Convention was the fourth such to establish principles for the treatment of enemy soldiers and civilians in wartime."
"I hope that you will support my call for a United Nations committee to review it, to determine whether further changes are needed concerning armed insurgents and terrorists who do not fall within the traditional definitions and, if not, at least call on the Americans to sign the 1977 amendments to extend protection to guerrillas and combatants, amendments which the US has refused thus far to sign."
"In his state of the union address, President Bush displayed a shocking belligerence."
"Just as his environmental policies lead to global warming, so his diplomatic and military policies are pushing the world towards a new cold war."
"In this century every shot the US fires will indeed, in the words of the poet Emerson, ""ring round the world"" and unless you can appeal to, and nurture, a wider concept of American self-interest, then we risk the menace of a new military millennium."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, High Representative, we are being haunted by the chronicle of long-expected and mindless acts of violence in the Middle East."
"You said that politicians feel a sense of frustration, not to mention cynicism."
"This translates as melancholy, sadness, distress, fear, anxiety and despair for the people."
"We could continue by saying that the Israelis certainly have not done what was necessary."
"Mr Sharon' s strategy consists of destroying Palestinian infrastructures, because he does not believe in the Palestinian State, he does not want a Palestinian State."
"He has spent his whole life fighting a Palestinian State."
"We must therefore make him understand that he will only achieve peace and security in his country if there is a Palestinian State."
"And, to do this, we must enter into a dialogue of political interference in Israel."
"It is the Israeli people that must be made to understand that they can only have security if there is the Palestinian State."
"The only possibility of security for Israel is if there is a Palestinian State."
"As far back as 1972, I defended this thesis and I was almost beaten up during an important meeting at the University of Jerusalem."
"I know what fighting for this issue means in Israel, but there is no other solution."
"Similarly, there is no other solution than saying that, in the Palestinian territories, there will be no return of all Palestinians to the State of Israel."
"The numbers of those returning will be limited, we must have the courage to say this, but a State of Israel is a State of Israel, a Palestinian State is a Palestinian State and the two must remain separate."
"The price of this is that there will be a European intervention force between the Palestinians, maintaining security in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Jaffa, but which also maintains security in Ramallah, Gaza and in other Palestinian towns."
"You will say to me 'But who are we to do this?'"
"Mr Sakellariou will say 'Europe means nothing."
"No one listens to us.'"
"First of all, we must want to be heard, we must want to speak out, we must want to say 'No, it is not up to the Americans to run global politics!'"
"We, the European Union, know that the Middle East conflict is a result of a fundamental European crisis."
"It is our responsibility, the responsibility of Germany, the responsibility of others who created the situation that we now have in the Middle East."
"This is why we must not give up."
"This means that today, we must break down the barriers that are isolating President Arafat."
"This does not mean that I believe President Arafat is absolved of all responsibility."
"He is as hypocritical as Mr Sharon."
"They are two old gentlemen who have been fighting for decades in this region and we know that hypocrisy is one of their common weapons."
"They know one another very well, they do the same thing."
"That is not the problem."
"It is not a question of moral standards."
"As one speaker said today, there is an elected president - Mr Arafat. There is a second - Mr Sharon."
"I can do nothing, even though, in any case, I would not have voted for Mr Arafat or for Mr Sharon."
"Democracy is not what I decide, it is what the majority decides. Nothing can be done."
"We have to put up with the situation."
"I shall therefore come back to the point that we must break down the barriers that are isolating Mr Arafat."
"This is why our group is asking the European Parliament to invite Mr Arafat and Mr Perez to have a discussion with us."
"They both hold the Nobel Peace Prize, therefore they know what is meant by peace."
"Well, let us invite two holders of the Nobel Peace Prize to discuss the subject of peace with us here in Strasbourg."
"And let us put pressure on Mr Perez to allow Mr Arafat to leave."
"It is scandalous that it is Mr Sharon who decides whether Mr Arafat has the right to take part in a meeting in Brussels or in Strasbourg or wherever."
"It is up to us to intervene politically to break down the barriers isolating Mr Arafat."
"We must fund, organise and support all the NGOs that are fighting at civil society level for new relations to be forged and so that everything between the Israelis and Palestinians will not collapse, as there are some wonderful things being done in this region."
"Those who have often visited Palestine and Israel know this."
"This is why we have a fundamental responsibility to contradict the key phrase that you hear in Israel, which is 'there is no other solution' ."
"This is not true; there is always another solution."
"I know that today, as Mr Patten said, those who speak of peace are not listened to, but if we manage to show that the other side can hear the initiatives we are proposing, then there will be many more initiatives, like those by the soldiers who are saying that they want to defend the security of Israel, but do not want to occupy Palestinian territories and the Palestinians."
"This is why I hope that Parliament will have the courage to make a determined effort in its attempt to influence the Israeli and Palestinian civil societies and make a strong gesture by inviting Mr Arafat and Mr Peres to Strasbourg, in order to break down the barriers isolating Yasser Arafat."
"Mr President, High Representative, I welcome many of the positions that you have clearly outlined, Mr Solana, particularly regarding the Palestinian Authority and its president."
"I also know that you are working in a creative and worthwhile manner with your many counterparts in order to encourage the prospect of a breakthrough in the situation."
"I also thank Mr Patten for his fair and forceful words on the subject of the destruction of infrastructures which symbolise the heart of the Palestinian State."
"I think, however, that the general attitude of the Fifteen is still greatly out of touch with the extreme seriousness of the situation in the Middle East."
"In my view, there is a great danger of seeing the majority of Palestinians lose their last hope for peace out of dignity."
"A nation that is submitted to this sort of daily humiliation by the occupying forces must never feel that the whole world does not care."
"We must therefore make ourselves heard."
"As Mr Poettering rightly pointed out, it is not normal for the head of a government to express regret that a man, recognised by the whole international community as the leader of a people and a nation, was not killed 20 years ago."
"What do we think of this?"
"And how has Europe reacted to the dangerous green light given by President Bush to Mr Sharon' s policy under which he makes things worse in order to further his own ends?"
"The rapport between them is as threatening as a violent storm cloud."
"Conversely, how are we interpreting the signs, a growing number of which is evident amongst the Israeli population, of a deep-rooted opposition to Mr Sharon' s policy on the basis of the fundamental requirement that the military occupation of the Palestinian territories must be brought to an end?"
"I am thinking of the courageous statements made by Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, who believes that a nation of occupants will end up being disfigured by the crimes of occupation."
"I am thinking of the 300 men and women who travelled from Israel to Ramallah this weekend to deliver a message of peace to Mr Arafat."
"I am thinking of the appeal launched by 52 Israeli officers and soldiers to no longer agree to fight in order to occupy, deport, destroy, blockade, kill, starve and humiliate a whole nation of people."
"The latest opinion polls reveal a profound distrust of Mr Sharon' s security policy and almost an absolute majority in favour of peace with the Palestinians."
"Do such facts not give us more room to manoeuvre than those that we use to significantly heighten the tone when faced with the irresponsible attitude of the current head of the Israeli government?"
"What are you intending to do, Mr Solana, in this area, to support the forces of peace in Israel?"
"Lastly, practical measures are as important as fair words in diplomacy and these measures are now expected from Europe."
"One of the very significant initiatives, such as the one I proposed to you in an open letter that I sent last week, and the essence of which Mr Cohn-Bendit has just partly taken up, could be to invite President Arafat, and possibly Shimon Peres, to the European Council and to the European Parliament and, if Mr Sharon dared to defy the European Union by using force to prevent our guest from travelling, to organise a joint visit by the 15 Foreign Affairs Ministers to Ramallah and to clearly express an opinion on the conditions that, in Europe' s view, would secure a return to peace."
"I believe that it is of utmost urgency to give, in one way or another, those who support dialogue and peace on both sides the prospect of a breakthrough, which they vitally need."
"Simply by doing this, you will present - and I know that this is your desire - Europe with a task that rivals its greatest ambitions."
"Welcome"
"I have the pleasure of informing Parliament that Mr Rodrigo Samayo Rivas, President of the Central American Parliament, and Mr Manuel Gamero Durón, Vice-President, have taken their seats in the gallery of official visitors."
"I extend a very warm welcome to them on our debate on the Middle East."
"Situation in the Middle East (continued)"
"Mr President, like previous speakers I, too, am gravely concerned that since last December the situation in the Middle East has deteriorated to a new low."
"There has been an appalling loss of life, the conflict in the region between the Israeli and the Palestinian people has deepened and the hopes of restarting the peace process regrettably have receded."
"Between 15 January and 25 January last, over 45 people were injured from bomb attacks alone, while ten people were killed during the same period."
"This is a staggering level of violence and hatred by any standards."
"Hundreds of Palestinians have been left homeless as a result of the demolition of nearly 100 houses by the Israeli forces at the refugee camp in the Gaza Strip."
"I very much welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency has written to the Israeli Foreign Minister expressing our deepest concern at the damage that has been done to projects funded by the European Union as a direct result of Israeli attacks against the Palestinian institutions."
"Mr President, violence has brought neither greater freedom to the Palestinian people, nor greater security for the Israeli people."
"In both cases the result of violence over the last few months has achieved the opposite to what was originally intended."
"Violence has only resulted in an intensification of hatred and recriminations between the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples."
"The Israelis and Palestinians must resume the search for peace and the two sides must act together and they must act in tandem."
"The Mitchell principles have clearly laid down the broad parameters for an overall peace agreement."
"Any future agreement must both recognise Israel's right to live in peace and security and ensure that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are protected and promoted."
"This means the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories."
"Israeli and Palestinian authorities are going to have to move to renew some level of security cooperation with the aim of ending this awful present cycle of violence."
"Persons involved in perpetrating any of these awful terrorist attacks which have taken place must be arrested and must be brought to justice, including terrorists operating in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad organisations."
"Recent discussions between representatives of the Palestinian authority and Prime Minister Sharon must be seen as a somewhat positive move, but negotiations must surely be meaningful and cannot be seen as a cosmetic exercise under any circumstances."
"We must all remember that Yasser Arafat is the democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people and he has the political authority and the political mandate to represent the concerns and the needs of the Palestinian people at this time."
"Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people, but of the broader international community."
"I welcome the recent article written by him in the New York Times in which he stated that the Palestinians were ready to end the conflict with Israel."
"This call for reconciliation and coexistence must be welcomed by all interested parties."
"I strongly believe that the EU must continue to play as active a role as possible in brokering a peace between both sides."
"President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon are meeting this week and I hope that this will signal a more willing involvement on the part of the United States to re-intensify its efforts to reach a political agreement in the region."
"I strongly believe that the European Union and the American government have mutually important roles to play in ending the violence in the region and restarting meaningful peace talks."
"Finally, the Israelis and the Palestinians must also calm the situation and de-escalate the conflict."
"Sustained attacks by Israel on the Palestinian Authority and its security forces and facilities are wholly misguided."
"Incursions by the Israeli military forces into Palestinian territories must be halted immediately and there must also be a lifting of restrictions that are imposed on the Palestinian people."
"Let us all remember, as was said by previous speakers, that the alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy."
"Thank you, Mr President, there is, once again, a glimmer of hope in the Middle East."
"There are two indications of this."
"First of all, there was the discussion between Prime Minister Sharon and prominent representatives of the Palestinian Authority that was held in the middle of last week."
"Furthermore, a regular follow-up every couple of weeks has been announced."
"In addition, there is the public assurance by Mr Arafat in the American press that he wants to call an end to the terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens."
"I sincerely hope that the meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon next Thursday will help these developments move towards a de-escalation of the extremely bloody Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
"Just consider the extent of the killings and destruction on both sides."
"And suffering, certainly personal suffering, cannot be captured in cold statistics or weighed up on a merely rational level."
"Meanwhile, a consistent rejection of, and fight against, terrorism do remain the conditions par excellence for creating any political compromise between the State of Israel and its neighbours."
"This is of direct interest to various countries in the region, for they fan the Palestinian and Lebanese flames of terrorism willingly and knowingly."
"This is why the clear warning by President Bush addressed to them in last Wednesday' s State of the Union speech deserves full support from the EU Member States."
"However, this political realism is lacking on our Continent, precisely at a time when European shortcomings have come to light in NATO in such a poignant way."
"The EU Member States support efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, especially by making a credible and effective contribution to the current fight against terrorist networks in that region."
"This will benefit the Israelis and Palestinians alike."
"I would therefore call on the Member States in the person of their High Representative, Mr Solana, to make this contribution."
"Last week, a young person from my town, Apeldoorn, sent a touching e-mail about peace in the Middle East."
"His appeal was not for a spiral of violence but a spiral of prayer."
"Along with the psalmist, I would say indeed: pray for the peace of Jerusalem."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think that Mr Patten' s comments - and I am sorry that he is not here at the moment - are absolutely unacceptable."
"In my view, to speak of the senseless destruction - and this is a point on which we obviously agree with him - of the Palestinian infrastructure and to speak of the selective killings of Palestinians without mentioning the Israeli victims is absolutely intolerable."
"But this is also symptomatic of the policy that Commissioner Patten has, for many months, been conducting towards Israel."
"I am pleased that the High Representative, Mr Solana, is here with us, because at least he can raise the quality of our debate slightly above the level we are used to in this House."
"Having said that, I do not think, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that we can resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine by simply asking both sides to make a little effort, or even asking both to make a great effort."
"Mr Barak made some proposals with which we are all familiar and these proposals were not accepted."
"The Palestinian Authority existed and the Palestinian Authority has sanctioned the suicide attacks that were and still are carried out every day against Israel."
"That is the reality today."
"I think that the European Union has an opportunity to show true generosity, but not by means of the tourist trips that Mr Wurtz is suggesting."
"The European Union could show its true generosity by saying to the public, to the people of Europe, that they must have the courage to fully integrate Israel into the European Union, that this is the only way to guarantee security in Israel, to finally give five million Israelis the feeling that they can live in peace alongside the Palestinians, but within the European Union."
"This proposal has been put forward."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must urgently begin to reflect on this in slightly more depth."
"Mr President, I have the feeling that, recently, in each debate in this Parliament on the Middle East, we basically go over the same ground."
"The only thing that changes is the state of the crisis, which, unfortunately, is increasingly worse in that region."
"Since the last resolution we approved in the European Parliament, with the majority support of the parliamentary groups, there have evidently been more terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians."
"I think there have been five in the last ten days."
"We have also, however, seen the siege by the Israeli army increasingly close in on the Palestinian population and its institutions."
"There has been very considerable material and personal damage which I consider to be completely unjustifiable."
"Within the landscape of violence, which is very controversial both inside and outside the region and also here in the European Parliament, we should be able to agree on certain things."
"The first is that nothing can justify acts of terrorism, which reduce the chances of peace and produce nothing but pain and indignation."
"The second is that it seems clear that the Palestinian National Authority does not have the capacity to restrain this wave of violence."
"The third is that not everything is permissible in the fight against terrorism: when we have the Rule of Law, we must always act within the parameters of the law and with scrupulous respect for human rights."
"The fourth is that the parties in conflict must understand that no act of violence is going to improve their position."
"And the fifth is that we cannot stand on the sidelines; on the contrary, the European Union must maintain its political pressure and its permanent presence in the region."
"I am happy to see the efforts the Council and the Commission are making, but I am even happier to hear that there is a glimmer of light on the horizon."
"I agree with the Council declaration, which says that our first priority must be to put an end to the suffering of both peoples."
"And it seems to me completely pointless for us to try to find somebody to blame."
"On the contrary, I believe that we must seek solutions and, for example, the European Parliament should promote and sponsor an international conference for peace in the Middle East, a second instalment of the one held in Madrid ten years ago, from which Mr Solana could no doubt recount many experiences."
"Let us hope that amongst all of us we can contribute to peace, because I believe that that is the only truly important thing at the moment."
"Mr President, High Representative, today' s debate seems to me to be a proper debate."
"I appreciate the Presidency' s flexibility as regards time: if the President wants to make this a genuine political debating chamber once again, it may be no bad thing that he is showing some flexibility towards us."
"I would like to say that we are caught up in an appalling, absurd situation: when the Israelis elected Ariel Sharon to power they thought he would bring them more security, but they are now in a terrible situation."
"When President Bush was giving his assessment of the tragic situation after the attacks on the Twin Towers, he gave the impression of intending to eradicate the sources of hatred and to genuinely do something about this tragic affair."
"However, if the United States now backs Ariel Sharon, there is a danger that it will no longer be able to play the mediating role it had even under Bill Clinton."
"At present, it would appear that Yasser Arafat is not in control of the situation, for the terrorism of Hamas is still gathering momentum, but if Mr Arafat were to lose all support, the consequences for Palestine would not bear thinking about."
"Therefore, it is up to us, to Europe to do something."
"I do not want to shock anybody, but I believe that the only way to give Israel security - as many Members have said - is to establish a Palestinian State."
"Therefore, we must start to declare right now that we are prepared to recognise such a State and also that we need to have a special relationship with both the Israeli State and the Palestinian State."
"I will not go so far as to mention accession to the Union, as Mr Dupuis did, for fear of causing offence, but if Europe wants to genuinely lay the history of the twentieth century to rest, it cannot confine itself to enlargement and refuse to assume full responsibility for the consequences of European history."
"Mr President, the recent Palestinian suicide attacks, Israel' s tough reaction to them and, to some extent, the statements by Prime Minister Sharon about Mr Arafat, have once again brought the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a head."
"This spiral of violence must now be broken as a matter of urgency."
"The international community must urge both parties to reach a permanent settlement and cease the terror."
"One glimmer of hope is at any rate the consultation between Prime Minister Sharon and some Palestinian official representatives that was held last weekend."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, a tougher stance would be welcome."
"We must strengthen our position in the peace talks, given the exceptional interests - and first and foremost the humanitarian interests - that are at stake."
"European leaders can no longer afford to look on from the sidelines, at the risk of a much greater and more extensive conflict emerging in the Middle East."
"The peace process will be a lengthy and tiresome process, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance, we can attain our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East."
"I too nurture some small hope."
"In actual fact, there seems to be greater awareness within Parliament of the tragedy taking place and also of where responsibility lies for this situation, not least our own responsibility."
"As Mr Solana has said on a number of occasions: we have wasted many opportunities."
"I fear we will waste others too, but I do feel it is important that we have gained this awareness."
"I find Mr Bush' s support of Ariel Sharon' s policy truly irresponsible, opportunist and inhumane, for it is not that the two sides lack confidence in each other: this is a specific policy, a specific decision - Ariel Sharon has made this explicitly clear in his speeches in the Knesset - not to allow a Palestinian State to exist, apart from 'Bantustan' territories, and not to give back the Occupied Territories."
"I do not understand why we do not realise that this is his policy and take appropriate action."
"At the same time, some responsibility certainly lies with Yasser Arafat, and it is an appalling tragedy for both Palestinians and Israelis that terrorist acts are taking place."
"However, my hope lies in Commissioner Patten' s words, in Mr Solana' s words, in actions and signs, and I would like to tell you of the great hope that I have in Israeli society."
"On Saturday, together with 300 Israelis - young people, coloured people, young lads who have refused to serve in the Occupied Territories, women, university professors - we crossed the Kalandia checkpoint, running serious risks for the Israelis who crossed it were told they were not allowed to enter the Occupied Territories."
"Three hundred of us crossed the Kalandia checkpoint to go to meet Yasser Arafat."
"The young Israelis said: 'We want peace."
"We are the other Israel' ."
"And Mr Arafat embraced them."
"However, the most important part was in the afternoon when we met the Palestinians and Palestinian organisations, and they too displayed their desire for peace."
"I therefore feel that it is imperative that we believe in these organisations and act to support them."
"I too, like Mr Cohn-Bendit, want to issue a challenge."
"If Mr Arafat leaves the territories, there is a danger that we will not be able to get him back in again."
"It is important that we work to support this operation, to bring Abu Ala and Avraham Burg here."
"International protection is vital for the Palestinian people; moreover - and here I agree with Mr Sakellariou - it is vital that we take practical action, even suspending the association agreement, for Israel must respect human rights."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic situation of Palestine illustrates two political truths, which are only bitter for utopians."
"First of all, each nation necessarily aspires to sovereignty, in other words, to have the full reign of a territory that is its own and which it can organise as it wishes."
"Secondly, it is not, therefore, borders which create conflicts, but the lack of safe and recognised borders."
"It is not the division of nations which engenders war, it is when the nations are thrown together."
"Throughout the world, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies have failed, causing bloodshed, and yet there are many utopians even in this House who would like to conduct such experiments on our European societies."
"I greatly admire Mr Cohn-Bendit' s realistic attitude towards the Middle East, an attitude that totally contradicts the hare-brained ideas of his friends and his own colleagues, regarding the situation in France for example."
"That said, the tragic but fragmented events - bloody attacks, arms trafficking, the mutual accusations of murder, terrorism, the repeated failures at maintaining a truce, the unacceptable destruction - are sad consequences, which must not, however, be confused with the profound causes of the situation."
"The fundamental problem is that there will only be peace if the Israelis and the Palestinians each have a territory that is marked by recognised borders and, within this territory, they have the opportunity to govern their country freely, without threats or interference."
"The State of Israel now possesses three quarters of Palestine' s former territory under the British mandate."
"The Palestinians must be permitted to live freely, in peace, in the other quarter."
"As sensitive as some places are for the Jewish people and for other believers, places which have great religious significance, we must bring an end to the colonisation of the occupied territories which stems from 1967."
"We must observe the United Nations Security Council resolutions and we must also bring an end to a military occupation that has lasted for almost 35 years now and which is an outright record in history."
"Of course, Israel has a right to secure serious guarantees in exchange for its withdrawal."
"These guarantees can be granted within the framework of the United Nations Organisation, and, in particular, by the United States of America."
"They must be more serious than those that failed to prevent the 1967 conflict. However, this is no longer 1967."
"Israel must thus have the courage to appreciate its victories, to withdraw from the occupied territories."
"Only then can peace return to the Middle East."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, one victim of the recent bombings in the Middle East, in which Israeli civilians were targeted, has been the willingness of moderates to form coalitions."
"I think one has to distinguish between murdering civilians willy-nilly, pursuing possible terrorists or, on the other hand, setting a 7-day deadline and positively inviting the radicals to promptly wreck the possibilities for dialogue."
"Israeli settlement policy, which is to be continued, provides us with examples of this sort of thing, as does the hopeless existence which drives Arab Palestinian refugees to turn themselves into weapons, and the consideration of the idea that they should return to their original homes and thereby put a question mark against the State of Israel's long-term viability."
"We also see it in the destruction of infrastructure on Palestinian territory, and that in areas that have nothing to do with counter-terrorism, but - as Commissioner Patten rightly said - destroy prospects for development."
"It is for these reasons that we have to make it clear that we, the European Union, have to make a fresh start, and it is perhaps not right that you, Mr Solana, are going there to play for high stakes in a week's time, followed by the American representative the week after."
"So we shuttle hither and thither and get nowhere."
"Why do you not, for once, go there together in the same week in order to make clear that this is a joint European and American initiative to hammer the point home that we will no longer allow things to go on the way they are."
"Both of you must go there together and take funds with you in order simultaneously to give hope and guarantees of security."
"We must find a new point of departure, and we will not do it in the ways we have used so far, nor - and this remark I address to Mr Sakellariou and others - by adopting resolutions apportioning guilt in a one-sided way, because then we are destroying the opportunity to be intermediaries."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the reports you have presented today may not have been positive or optimistic, but they sketched a realistic picture."
"I am very glad that, after a short, perhaps terrifying moment, the European Union has clearly demonstrated that it is not willing to sit back and let the Palestinian structures, supported moreover by funds raised by the European Union, be destroyed."
"This is not about denying Israel the right to defend itself against terrorism, but about our strongest condemnation and rejection of excessive courses of action that really have nothing to do with counter-terrorism."
"I am very pleased that this is what both representatives have done, clearly and unmistakably, and that they have made their position clear without falling prey to emotionalism."
"That is important because the pro-peace groupings that are present both in Israel and in Palestine are waiting for Europe's voice to be heard."
"I support all the efforts at joint action with the USA, but where this is not possible, we must be an identifiable, and indeed, readily recognisable, European voice."
"My second observation, on the Balkans, may well be taken as underlining all of what has been said here."
"I would only ask that particular additional attention be given to the situation in Albania, where things are not at present developing very well."
"I wish to make it very clear that I cannot see us going down the road towards an association agreement with Albania if Albania does not concern itself with the country's stabilisation."
"What has happened in the past weeks is, alas, no contribution to stability."
"We want stability in the Balkans, we have done much, and with great effort, to achieve it, and let no power in the Balkans cause this stability to collapse again."
"I would therefore ask you both to follow events in Albania, in particular, very closely, and represent our positions there with a great deal of clarity."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"After months of heartrending and meaningless violence in the Middle East, we must now nurse and foster each and every glimmer of hope."
"President Arafat has indicated that he is prepared to negotiate with any Israeli party and to help search for a creative solution for the return of the refugees."
"These are two courageous steps forward which deserve our support and should be immediately responded to by an equally generous offer by Prime Minister Sharon."
"In addition, we have noticed that, in Israel, a shift has emerged in public opinion with regard to one of the key issues of the conflict, namely the illegal occupation of the Palestinian regions."
"There are now 110 reservists of the Israeli army who have signed a petition in which they refuse to take part in the occupation any longer."
"These brave soldiers deserve the open and emphatic support of the European Union because they are choosing international law and human rights, rather than choosing to obey their orders and to follow the path of least resistance."
"They are, in fact, choosing the road of peace, away from occupation, away from terror and state terror, and towards the negotiating table and, hopefully, peace eventually."
"I would be interested to hear from Messrs Solana and Patten whether they are prepared to express this support."
"It is with considerable sadness, and with full sympathy for your frustration, High Representative Solana, that we have seen the ongoing deterioration of the situation in the Middle East over the past few months, especially when we were convinced, after 11 September, of the urgent need to find a political solution to the problem."
"I should simply like to recall the closing statement of the special session of the Mediterranean Forum, held in Brussels in November, before the vote on 13 December on our recommendations preceding the formal declaration by the Laeken Council."
"I would remind you that this statement called for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the Tenet plan and of the recommendations of the Mitchell committee, and reiterated our conviction, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that establishing an impartial monitoring mechanism would serve the interests of both parties."
"It has to be said that all of this has come to nothing and that, in fact, recent events seem to have closed the door on any serious attempt to restart negotiations."
"Although, like William of Orange, I believe that it is neither necessary to have hope in order to embark on a course of action nor is it necessary to succeed in order to persevere, I feel that we must welcome the fact, Mr Solana, that you are ceaseless, as you have just demonstrated, in making every possible effort to give renewed hope, which is so badly needed in that part of the world, to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples."
"We can only encourage you to pursue all initiatives for cooperation between the United Nations, the United States and the most directly involved Arab States, in order to put forward proposals, in conjunction with them, on actions that are crucial to restoring mutual trust and respect, without which the current downward spiral of violence can never be halted."
"This is why I am not in favour of our Parliament today playing the role of excommunicator."
"As Commissioner Patten said in his last speech to this House, 'What is past, is past' ."
"What we are interested in is the future and the immediate future."
"I also feel that I am summing up the opinion of the majority of Members when I repeat that we in Parliament are ready and willing to fulfil our mandate to take the initiative by issuing another invitation - why not President Cox? - to the representatives of the two States at the highest level, perhaps even Mr Arafat himself, to come and explain their intentions to us, as the speakers of the Palestinian Legislative Council and the Knesset did in September 2000."
"By the same token, we would like to encourage you to give positive consideration, in conjunction with the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, to the possibility of holding an ambitious peace conference along the lines of the conference held in Madrid, in which, Mr Solana, you played such an important part, as you reminded us."
"In our own interests and for the sake of coherence with the spirit of our unreserved commitment to the fight against terrorism, we must play as active a role as possible in saving the peace process, while respecting the legitimate rights of the region' s peoples."
"Mr President, the European reaction, which has been somewhat more coherent than usual, has come at the right time."
"It has now become quite clear that Mr Sharon' s policy is leading nowhere."
"When there are no political prospects on the horizon, the Old Testament prescription of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' leads directly to horror and to chaos."
"Bloodshed leads to further bloodshed."
"This is a return to the Middle Ages, even to prehistoric times."
"It is therefore high time that the Council of the European Union, the Commission and all our governments spoke up, loudly and clearly, whatever the President of the United States might think."
"It is Mr Sharon, and not Mr Arafat, who has the power to end the conflict."
"How can he do this?"
"Simply by complying with international law, by ending the repressive occupation of Palestine and by withdrawing behind Israel' s internationally recognised borders."
"The best way to protect both Israeli and Palestinian citizens is to re-establish a proper border between the two peoples."
"The way out of the deadlock of hatred does not lie in the humiliation and the destabilisation of Mr Arafat."
"It lies in land distribution and in acknowledging Palestinian nationhood, not in the medium term, but immediately."
"Mr Solana, Mr Patten, you must state this quite clearly."
"This is the urgent message that all of Europe' s representatives should be conveying."
"Mr President, I too congratulate the High Representative, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten for their untiring work."
"We share your frustration at the lack of outcomes."
"Has the time come now for us to move on from dialogue and move into shared partnerships, overcoming perceived religious differences to tackle common human evils of poverty, ill health and illiteracy?"
"Surely the place today for dialogue is within Islam, between Muslim and Muslim, to work out ways of discarding false jihads, rejecting distorted interpretations of the Koran that lead inevitably to misguided martyrdoms and terrorist assaults."
"Islam is a faith that promotes peace, equality and a secure life."
"Meanwhile we should tackle the lack of democracy in the oil-rich states."
"Here we can assist through building civil society and use means such as our association agreement with Egypt to exert undoubted influence."
"High Representative Solana mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"My view is his as well."
"I believe we should open a Commission office in Tehran as soon as possible."
"This is an Islamic state, and yet a democracy; it has Sharia law, and yet a parliament."
"Surely Iran is part of the solution rather than part of the problem - a peaceful society in a violent region."
"I thank our Commissioner and our High Representative and their staff for all their work."
"Mr President, Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon's recent remark that he regrets not having killed Yasser Arafat in Lebanon in 1982 is unforgivable."
"But I suppose we should not be surprised: Mr Sharon's own terrorist behaviour in Lebanon, when he permitted the massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, was subsequently condemned by Israel's Kahane Commission of Inquiry."
"Given this fact, it is regrettable that he was subsequently elected as Prime Minster of Israel, this being the root of many of the current problems."
"Current Israeli policy is ludicrous and counterproductive."
"How can they make demands on Arafat to behave as if he was the leader of a normal state, while at one and the same time they make him a virtual prisoner in his own home, destroy his airport and his broadcasting station and humiliate him?"
"Who do they want to replace him with?"
"In the post-11 September situation, the European Union has been oversensitive in its approach to the Middle East."
"We are indeed an honest broker and we should be vigorous in that approach."
"The fact that the Americans are indebted to us for the solidarity and the support that we provided when they needed it should mean that we are entitled to a reciprocal response from them."
"And instead of being the puppet of Israel, they should join with us in an even-handed policy approach to the tragedy in the Middle East."
"If that is not forthcoming, then we should act on our own."
"It is frustrating that the United States through its present stance is becoming much more part of the problem than part of the solution."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for continuing, in spite of everything, with their already excessively longstanding efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East."
"We are clearly facing a frustrating, cruel and, if I may say so, surreal, situation."
"It is surreal because we are facing a situation in which the Prime Minister of Israel does not support the constructive conclusions of his Foreign Affairs Minister."
"It is also surreal because Mr Sharon - who regrets not having destroyed Mr Arafat, who he describes as irrelevant, in Beirut in 1982, and who calls the Palestinian Authority a terrorist organisation - is meeting with three notable members of this so-called terrorist organisation."
"It is surreal because Mr Arafat is under great pressure to combat terrorism but, at the same time, Israel - and we are allowing it - is bombing and thereby destroying the resources available to the Palestinian Authority for combating that terrorism."
"This surrealism, however, is welcome if it can bring us closer to peace and development in the region, not only for Palestine."
"I would like to say however - and I hope I am wrong - that I hope these talks by Mr Sharon with these supposed terrorists from a supposed terrorist organisation, are not simply another attempt to gain time before his meeting with President Bush in Washington tomorrow."
"I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, a question relating to the famous seized vessel, the Karim-A: it appears that the people who are trying to ascertain whether the evidence of Iran' s involvement is reliable are working on the basis of stronger evidence than the appearance of arms which are 'made in Iran' , because we all know that the fact that arms are manufactured in a particular country does not necessarily mean that they are supplied by the government of that country."
"Mr President, I say this - and I will end here - because, in this era of trilateral evil, and the demonisation of the situation and the desire to spread suspicions all over the place, it could be a fatal error to encourage suspicions of this type in relation to those invisible enemies which Mr Bush is currently dealing with."
"Mr President, this debate has focused largely on the situation in the Middle East."
"I am not sure that the largely one-sided tone of this Chamber is at all helpful."
"I endorse Mr Brok's call for a more balanced approach but as requested I also want to take the opportunity briefly to touch on another area of crisis which is of increasing concern at the moment and where the European Union has the capacity to exert some influence."
"I am referring to Zimbabwe."
"Even if electoral observers are allowed in, we must maintain the pressure on Mr Mugabe to deliver free and fair elections."
"We do not want to be in a position of merely recording that the election was fixed and standing back and wringing our hands afterwards."
"We want the presence of observers to deter violence and electoral fraud so that the Zimbabwean people can make a genuinely free choice."
"Many of us continue to be alarmed by reports from inside Zimbabwe about the situation on the ground."
"I am referring to the fact that five MDC supporters have been killed in the past week, that MDC demonstrations and rallies have been disrupted by the police, that the independent press is restricted, the Independent correspondent, Basildon Peta, was earlier today arrested under the Public Order and Security Act and the Australian journalist Sally Sara has been refused admission."
"Taken together one might think that these matters already constitute a breach of EU conditions."
"I have some questions for Mr Solana."
"What representations are being made to the Government of South Africa to apply greater regional pressure on the Mugabe government?"
"Are the measures for the implementation of smart sanctions now in place?"
"What level of deterioration in the situation will trigger these sanctions?"
"Is the European Union's response being fully coordinated with that of the United States?"
"Thank you, Mr President, talking about the conflict in the Middle East means being faced with the substantial dilemma of striking a balance between Israel' s right to safe borders and a viable Palestinian state."
"We are further from this goal than ever before, or so it seems."
"Nobody feels safe anymore, either in Israel or in the Palestinian state."
"Nobody appears to be able to play an objective role in getting the peace process back on track."
"The extremists set the agenda, and the Americans seem to tolerate the tough stance adopted by Prime Minister Sharon."
"Whichever way one defines the position of President Arafat, it seems to me that, without him, chaos would descend on the Palestinian Regions."
"What can the European Union do?"
"In my view, we should mainly keep the channels of communication open."
"I back those fellow MEPs who say that we must continue talks with both parties and exert pressure on Israel to accept the Palestinian Authority as the only significant interlocutor, and so find the way back to consultation."
"However, we must also continue to ask Mr Arafat to tackle the terrorists on his own home turf."
"The European Union should be prepared to postpone a certain form of cooperation with Israel in this context, but not to rule such postponement out in respect of the Palestinian Authority either, should it transpire that the fight against terrorism is not being taken seriously."
"This brings me to yet another point which I should like to put to Mr Solana."
"The conflict in the Middle East is also tied in with the relationship between the EU and the United States, and this issue is also important in the fight against terrorism."
"In addition, I should like to find out his reaction to the statements by President Bush who talks about the axis of evil and the three countries he refers to by this."
"What is the EU' s reaction to this?"
"Is he driving a new wedge between the European Union and the United States?"
"I would particularly like to know what implications these statements by President Bush have for the policy of the European Union, particularly with regard to Iran."
"I am interested to know how the Council assesses Iran, but also the other countries which are being accused by the Americans of state support for terrorism."
"In my opinion, this will be an important issue in the time to come, also in connection with the fresh debate on the military superiority of the United States and the military weakness of the European Union."
"Mr President, as the last Member to speak in today's debate, it appears to me that there has been an unusual degree of unanimity, accompanied both by concern and a determination to bring about some sort of happy ending."
"Are we really in the worst stage of the Palestinian crisis or has the tragedy risen to its climax, to be followed by catharsis and a way out?"
"Without wishing to judge, we must admit that Sharon's policy has even made victims of the Israelis: he has painted himself into a corner with a no-win policy."
"Perhaps Sharon dreams of a final solution to the Palestine problem, to complete the circle of one of the darkest periods in the history of Europe."
"But America must take its share of the blame for failing to understand that supporting no-win policies basically undermines its own policy and role."
"Are we Europeans merely bystanders here?"
"No, we are not."
"I believe that the proposals made by both Commissioner Pattern and the High Representative, Mr Solana, and everything else said during the debate, are very serious proposals with the potential to become practical policy."
"Nor do I think that we, the European Union, are mere bystanders doomed, like Sisyphus, to roll the boulder to the top of the mountain and then watch others toss it back over the edge."
"We must, however, also turn our attention to other matters because now we have a crisis in the Middle East and tension on the borders of the European Union."
"And then we have another crisis within Europe."
"The Balkan crisis."
"In this sense, Mr Solana was right to comment on the state of flux around Albania, around Kosovo, around Montenegro and the area in general, where there is not so much a fragile equilibrium as an unstable equilibrium, which is far worse."
"The success of any endeavour which, in the Balkans in particular, has been undertaken mainly by the European Union, must be based on - and we must insist on - a fundamentally political solution, because that is where, in the final analysis, we shall be judged on our ability to manage crises peaceably and bring about political results."
"I should just like to place on record our gratitude to the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Ramón de Miguel, for being here for the entire afternoon to listen to this debate."
"Frequently that is not the case in these debates."
"Mr President, I will try to be brief and to start by thanking you all - those who are here, those who have left - very much for your support for our efforts to bring peace to an area which, as I said at the very beginning, is geographically close to us and also very close to our hearts, minds and values."
"I would stress once again that the difficulty of the problem is not the absence of a mechanism to provide a solution to the crisis."
"We already have the Mitchell report, which contains the steps to be followed, and it has been accepted by both sides."
"The problem is not that we do not have rails on which the train should be travelling but that we have not been able to get the train out of the station."
"The train cannot leave the station until the requirement of a seven-day period of complete calm has been fulfilled."
"But what happens?"
"When you set seven days of complete calm as a precondition, you can always find somebody who is not for the peace process and who, at the last minute, can engineer a catastrophe."
"Therefore, you are back to square one."
"That has happened on a couple of occasions."
"This manner of doing things hands the initiative to the most radical people and takes it away from the moderates."
"That is the problem we have at this point in time."
"Let us hope that the modest beginnings of conversations - I would not call them negotiations between the two sides - held right now, yesterday, tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow, maybe at the beginning of the week, will produce at least a change in the way they handle the crisis, by not placing the solution in the hands of those who do not want the process to move forward."
"I have not received many questions."
"Therefore I am not going to respond to the very interesting remarks you have made. At least 90% of your statements have been supportive."
"Two questions have been put very clearly and I would like to answer them before I make my final remarks."
"On the question by Mr Menéndez del Valle regarding Karine-A, I do not have the intelligence on which several countries have based their statements."
"Several countries - some are members of the European Union - state that their intelligence has established a link."
"Whether it is a state-to-state or state-group-to-state-group link is an open question."
"But there is no doubt that some kind of link exists between the Iranian people and some Palestinians."
"The second question I would like to answer is from Mr Brok, although he is not here."
"This joint effort is being carried out every day on the ground by representatives of the European Union, of the United States, of the Secretary-General of the UN and of the Russian Federation."
"They work together every day."
"I would remind you also that we - that is, I, Mr Powell, Mr Ivanov, Mr Koffi Annan - meet regularly to deal with this issue collectively."
"We need to be tenacious and persevering."
"We also need a change in both societies, and not only in the authorities that lead the countries."
"Those societies have indeed changed very profoundly in the last few years."
"Israel has changed."
"The strong, broad-based peace camp there has not disappeared, but it has been reduced."
"The same thing has happened on the other side."
"Frustration has created a sentiment that the peace camp cannot bring about peace in a reasonable period of time."
"That lack of trust and of confidence between both sides was not present before."
"I remember very well the relative friendship in Oslo between Arafat and Peres and between Rabin and Arafat."
"That has disappeared."
"We have to do something to reconstruct society vis-à-vis society and we, as Europeans, have a tremendous amount of work to do there, to bring these societies together, because they will have to live together."
"Whatever we can do through this Parliament, through the institutions, through the NGOs, we must do."
"I would like to tell you two little anecdotes, one from a very good friend of mine who was in the peace camp in Jerusalem."
"The other day he told me that he would not dare send his daughter and his son to school in the same bus."
"That is a dramatic and profound change in the heart and in the mind of somebody who would otherwise be a fighter for peace."
"On the other side, on the Palestinian side, you go to a hospital, you talk to a paediatrician and he tells you how a little boy has been killed."
"This is a terrible blow to trust and confidence among people."
"Therefore we have to work also with societies."
"We have to engage societies, universities, schools, doctors, etc. to impress upon them that they have to live together and that Europe will be behind that sentiment of reconciliation."
"That is something we have to do."
"I will conclude by recalling a beautiful phrase from Yitzhak Rabin who, without any doubt, was the architect of the Oslo process, together with Shimon Peres."
"He used to say something that is still valid."
"We have to fight against terrorism, as if there were no negotiations, and we have to negotiate as if there were no terrorism."
"That is the approach we have to rally around today."
"It is necessary to continue the negotiations, to continue talking, to continue moving the political scene - the centre of gravity has to be politics."
"Until they put politics at the centre of gravity, it will be very difficult to move the process forwards."
"We can be proud of what we as Europeans are doing."
"We do not have the capacity to solve the problem, but we can move in the right direction as soon as possible and aim for peace."
"This is not a question only of values."
"It is part of our history, no doubt about that, but it is also part of our future, the future of this European Union, of the countries in an enlarged European Union and of the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, which are part of our family."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received seven motions for resolution to wind up the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Several colleagues - Mr Cohn-Bendit, General Morillon and some others - made a number of suggestions as to initiatives Parliament might take."
"I am very open to working with the Conference of Presidents and colleagues on those."
"Last week I had a very productive private meeting with Ambassador Moratinos to seek his advice as to how best to move some of these ideas forward."
"We will talk about that in the appropriate forum."
"Vertical agreements and concerted practices in the automobile industry"
"The next item is the Commission communication on vertical agreements and concerted practices in the automobile industry."
"Mr President, it is my pleasure to make this - albeit brief - presentation of the draft motor vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission adopted this morning."
"Parliament is aware of the relatively severe practical limitations of the current Block Exemption Regulation, which is due to expire next September."
"It is not sufficiently beneficial for consumers, particularly where they wish to exercise their right to a single market."
"Moreover, the rules currently in force hinder the development of new methods, including Internet distribution; lastly, access to technical information for independent repairers needs to be improved too."
"We have therefore put together this Block Exemption Regulation, which the Commission has adopted today, and I would like briefly to outline its main points."
"The basic line underpinning the regulation is that the new system must be more stringent than the existing regulations and must allow greater competition on the sales and after-sales markets."
"What are the main characteristics?"
"Firstly, as regards the sale of new vehicles, flexibility and freedom to choose are the draft' s key points."
"When they select their distributors, vehicle manufacturers can choose between a selective distribution system and a distribution based on territorial exclusivity, but they can no longer combine the two systems."
"Both systems allow a vehicle manufacturer to guarantee that the members of its distribution network are qualified and that its distribution network covers all the areas of Europe, thus ensuring total coverage of the territory."
"In both cases, the rights linked to the single market will be much, much better safeguarded than at present."
"In an exclusive distribution system, distributors will be assigned to a specific geographical area such as a city, within which no other distributor will be permitted to open a showroom or carry out sales activities."
"An exclusive dealership may, however, sell to any potential buyer that approaches its showroom."
"This also applies to independent resellers, to those known as grey resellers."
"These resellers could be supermarkets, for example, and they would exploit the price differentials to buy vehicles in countries where the prices are lower and then sell them in Member States where prices are higher, thus helping to create a genuine single market."
"If, on the other hand, manufacturers opt for selective distribution, the distributors can advertise and send out customised mail shots and e-mails to consumers throughout Europe, even visiting them in person."
"Consumers could, however, still encounter difficulties in dealing with a dealership from another Member State, particularly as regards simple, direct contact with the foreign dealership, payment of invoices and agreements regarding the delivery of the vehicle."
"We therefore deemed it necessary to adopt a more radical approach in order to bring about greater integration of the markets, making it genuinely possible for consumers to buy vehicles abroad."
"A vehicle distributor must be able to open sales or delivery outlets closer to consumers' places of residence, including in other Member States."
"On a practical level, this means, for example, that an Amsterdam Volkswagen dealer could open a showroom in the United Kingdom and sell Volkswagen Golfs there at the Dutch retail price, which is 23% lower than the British price."
"This, of course, would create the necessary market conditions for reducing the currently considerable price differentials of motor vehicles in the European Union."
"Then consumers are demanding multi-brand dealerships."
"The draft regulation makes multi-brand selling much more simple."
"The only permissible constraint is that the different brand models are displayed in different areas of a showroom so as to avoid confusion between brands."
"This display method is already used in car showrooms and has proved universally satisfactory."
"Moreover, the draft regulation seeks to reorganise the existing relationship between sales and after-sales services, allowing specialisation."
"Distributors will be able to opt to provide after-sales services themselves, as dealerships currently do, or they will be able to subcontract to one or more authorised repairers."
"These repairers must observe all the quality requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers."
"In addition, block exemption makes intermediaries' work much easier: one example is that of Virgin Cars, which buys vehicles on behalf of consumers and will now be able to find the best deal for consumers more easily."
"All these factors give distributors more room for manoeuvre to organise their activities on the basis of market conditions, exploiting new sales opportunities and thus consolidating their independence from manufacturers."
"Another way to reduce dealers' dependence on manufacturers is by laying down the obligation for manufacturers to give sufficient grounds for deciding to cancel distribution contracts."
"If the distributor does not agree with the grounds given, it can have recourse to a mediator or a court."
"Moreover, the Commission has decreed, through this draft regulation, that a reasonable period of notice must be given before the cancellation of a contract, in most cases two years."
"All these measures ensure that distributors can make full use of the new opportunities offered to them by this draft regulation."
"I would now like to say a few words on after-sales services, which are also extremely important."
"The new draft regulation seeks to ensure that consumers have a genuine choice and that they can have recourse to both authorised repairers and independent operators."
"In the interests of the safety and reliability of all vehicles - we have placed great emphasis on this objective - we have to ensure that all operators can compete with each other in all sectors without this affecting the quality of the service provided, which must continue to be of the highest level."
"The new regulation allows all vehicle manufacturers to set quality requirements which must be respected by all repairers who wish to be authorised repairers."
"Manufacturers can therefore guarantee that the members of their network comply with high quality standards."
"This avoids foreclosure of these markets as new operators could now be designated authorised repairers, provided, of course, that they are prepared to observe the requirements set by the vehicle manufacturers."
"The proposal also lays down the benefit for dealerships whose contract has come to an end of being able to continue to operate as official dealerships of their brand for as long as they satisfy the quality requirements."
"The general level of technical skill on the market is thus increased and a substantial Europe-wide network of official repairers is maintained. This will help to bring higher quality of service and greater road safety."
"Moreover, we can expect the proposal to have a positive impact on employment and small and medium-sized businesses."
"The proposal seeks to make it easier for independent operators on the after-sales market to compete."
"In view of the increasing complexity of motor vehicles, it is important for independent repairers to have better access to all the necessary technical information, including diagnosis devices, equipment and training."
"Any discrimination between official repairers which are part of the network and independent repairers is therefore unacceptable."
"The proposed changes also encourage the use of spare parts which are cheaper but of equivalent quality, making repair work less costly."
"I would like to end, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by focusing on the procedure."
"The next stage in the procedure is consultation with the European Parliament and the Member States and the publication of the draft regulation in the Official Journal."
"This will allow the Commission to receive comments from all the interested parties before adopting the final regulation."
"The whole process should be concluded before next summer."
"I am especially looking forward to giving a more detailed presentation of the draft regulation to the Parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 19 February and to continuing the fruitful dialogue already underway between the Commission and Members of Parliament, particularly Mr Konrad, who is your rapporteur for the subject, and the Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"Mr President, we have addressed a complex subject: a subject which is also extremely important, practical in nature and has wider significance."
"If we want the European citizens genuinely to identify with European integration, we cannot afford to let such a key element of the single market as that in motor vehicles to continue not to be a single market, for it would be unfair to the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner Monti, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks to you first of all, Mr Monti, for setting this proposal before Parliament."
"We very much welcome the fact that this proposal's first outing has brought you to Strasbourg, and this is much appreciated."
"As became clear during discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I welcome many points of this proposal, including those on the sale of more than one make of car, original spare parts, access to technical information, and liberalisation as regards the separation of service and sales, but I have a query about how freedom of establishment within the internal market is to be regulated."
"We in Germany have a regulation entitled the Group Exemption Regulation, which states that a regulatory framework should continue to exist, subject to a time limit."
"That is something I welcome."
"The content, though, amounts to liberalisation if all it says is that individual dealers may be restricted at national level but entitled to set up as many subsidiaries as they like within the EU internal market."
"This modifies these rules and makes a nonsense of them."
"It will create problems for us and we must discuss this."
"Such is my first important question in this context."
"Mr President, there is much to be welcomed in the Commissioner's statement, in particular its acknowledgement of the role of the grey market in bringing prices down, the use of the Internet, car supermarkets in the proper trade in spare parts and servicing."
"There is one question I have to ask."
"It looks as if in different national markets exclusivity can be maintained in a position which could be anti-competitive."
"How wide, in a given national market, could these exclusive deals with the dealer networks remain?"
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mr Monti for coming to Parliament today and making a very clear statement on a very complex issue."
"It would have been very helpful if we could have had the text in advance, but I understand and hope it will be available very quickly."
"I should like to raise two points with him."
"What concerns British consumers - and much of it is addressed in his proposal - is clearly the question of price."
"Does the Commissioner see a role for putting price bans and price guarantees in the regulation so it is reviewed after a certain period to ensure that prices are converging?"
"That would give a clear signal about the direction he wants to go."
"The second issue concerns freedom of dealers and their ability to invest."
"He has moved substantially in the right direction but I am concerned, in the example he gave, about the ability of a dealer to Holland to go and invest and set up a dealership in the UK."
"How is that going to protect dealers who already have a substantial investment?"
"Would it not be much better for them to be able to go and buy cars in Holland and sell them to consumers there, rather than have what could be a random solution which would actually dissipate the impact of the dealers' independence that he wants to give them?"
"I hope there will be further occasions, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example, to go more into the detail."
"What seems to me links the first two speeches is a concern that indeed would be there if a location clause could exist."
"One distinctive feature of today's Commission decision on the draft regulation is that the location clause is not there at any percentage level."
"This should go a long way towards alleviating those concerns."
"As regards making sure that prices converge, this is one of the objectives of the overall proposal."
"As you know, we keep regular track of the convergence or non-convergence of prices."
"We produce a report twice a year on the price of different models in the different Member States."
"That will be a powerful means of gauging the consequences, among other things, of this new regulation."
"We have resisted the temptation to become price regulators and to link specific competition arrangements for distribution to the size of the price differentials."
"It is not for us to say that this price differential is acceptable, but that this plus one is not."
"We are working on the roots of the phenomena, so that price convergence should develop."
"As for the Anglo-Dutch example, my answer briefly is that both modalities would be allowed, namely the setting up of dealers' outlets in the other countries and unrestricted trade without changing the location of the dealers."
"Mr President, on a point of order: before you ask the first speaker to make a contribution, I indicated that I wished to be added to the list."
"Mr President, I have a short question for the Commissioner."
"I was the rapporteur seven and a half years ago when we first discussed this project."
"I am pleased to see that the Commission has moved so far, but I still have a question."
"Maybe I am too cynical and too liberal, but why do we need to have rules?"
"Why cannot we just use the Treaty as it is?"
"Why do we need to have special rules for car dealers and for car sales?"
"So far as I am concerned we could use the normal competition rules."
"Mr President, I support Commissioner Monti's initiative and I am pleased that his Commission colleagues are also supporting him."
"Certainly the current rules benefit car manufacturers and dealers and disadvantage consumers."
"I see this particular proposal as upholding the principles of the single market, and I am convinced that it will lead to cheaper cars for EU citizens."
"I have one major concern and that concerns my own country."
"Is the Commissioner aware that the vehicle registration tax in Ireland will add anything between 50% and 100% to the price of cars?"
"So an initiative like this will be virtually meaningless unless the Commission is able to persuade the Irish authorities to reduce the vehicle registration tax."
"I know tax is a national competence, but we are moving towards harmonisation of tax and I would therefore humbly request that the Commissioner approach the Irish authorities to seek a reduction in the vehicle registration tax, so that Irish citizens can enjoy the same benefit as their continental counterparts."
"I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on steering this package, which was not entirely unanimous, through the Commission so skilfully."
"The same problems exist in the UK: 52 models examined in the UK are still more expensive."
"My question is the same as Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's."
"If we have the partial reforms that the Commissioner is proposing here today, and we carry those out in opening up the market to grey trade supermarkets, in particular Internet sales, is it not the case that the block exemption becomes obsolete, and when will the day be when we actually get rid of these rules?"
"Finally, Commissioner, in 1999 I asked you a question in response to which you told me that cars in Britain would be cheaper if Britain joined the euro."
"Is that still your position, and what difference do you think that would make in terms of price differentials?"
"I realise, not without relief, that I am not the Commissioner responsible either for taxation or for monetary union, but merely the Commissioner for humble competition policy which, nevertheless, has a role to play and tries to play it vigorously - with the support of Parliament, which is apparent once again today."
"On competition proper, why not be even more liberal and refrain from applying sector-specific rules?"
"Well, we have looked into this and a detailed analysis has brought us to the following conclusion. If we did not have specific rules for this industry competition-wise, the industry would fall under the application of the block-exemption regulation on vertical restrictions."
"That would have two main drawbacks."
"It would allow the industry to use very similar distribution agreements to those permitted at present, on which our evaluation report was pretty negative."
"Also applying the general regime would not be a satisfactory means of improving competition on the after-sales market."
"Independent repairers could be foreclosed from the market as a result."
"This is clearly something which could not be accepted."
"Furthermore, all motor vehicles would most likely continue to be distributed through the same type of selective and exclusive distribution systems if no new regulatory regime was introduced."
"Last, but not least, the general regime does not offer provisions which are crucial in the car sector to ensure benefits for the consumer."
"This is the case with the so-called availability clause, which allows, for instance, a British consumer to buy a right-hand-drive car in a left-hand-drive country."
"So, although we are in principle against sector-specific rules, as you have seen with the telecom package with my colleague, Mr Liikanen, we have moved some way towards the adoption of general competition rules."
"But here the particular nature of the situation has led us to firmly believe that a sector-specific rule would be more appropriate."
"As for supermarkets, for example, I can only say that, during the lengthy consultation process undertaken by the Commission, no supermarket or association speaking on its behalf directly expressed a desire to sell cars on a regular basis."
"On the other hand, it would not be true to suggest that the draft regulation adopted today gives no business opportunities to supermarkets."
"A supermarket could become a mono- or multi-brand sales dealer if it satisfied the criteria laid down by the manufacturer."
"Similarly, it may act as an intermediary for consumers."
"Finally, on the two issues which do not relate to competition but have a bearing on prices, tax and the euro, I will not go beyond the answer I gave on the issue of the UK, cars and the euro."
"As for taxation, the honourable Member underlined that this is a national responsibility and it is tempting, but perhaps not entirely consistent, to argue that this is to be jealously guarded as a national prerogative and yet ask the Commissioner to lobby actively for harmonisation."
"I will, however, pass this message on to my colleague, Mr Bolkestein."
"Mr President, Commissioner, everyone knows today that cars are complex and highly sophisticated products."
"If you now allow dealers to subcontract maintenance and repairs, an entire continuous chain of responsibility will be broken."
"This should cause us to be concerned for the consumer."
"How, in your opinion, Commissioner, will car manufacturers be able to honour their guarantees, ensure compliance with quality standards and, if necessary, recall vehicles if they now have only an indirect link with subcontractors?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the debate does not concern either the Commission' s final objectives or its principles in relation to this proposal, but rather the possible unwanted consequences which may result from the application of the future regulation of the sector."
"Therefore, given the removal of the localisation clause, I would ask you, Commissioner, whether you think there should be a transitional period for small distribution companies, bearing in mind the investments made or under way in this sector, which have a great influence on the level of employment."
"Commissioner, I congratulate you on the presentation of this document which is the last of the raft of rules relating to vertical restrictions."
"I would like to make some comments."
"You have given the example of the distributor in Amsterdam who could open a branch in London."
"Let us bear in mind that distributors are dependent - as always, but even more in this case, given the quantity of the investments to be made - on manufacturers, and that contracts do not extend for very long periods."
"It is true that, in the event of a resolution, they could go to tribunals, but I believe that, in the majority of EU countries - at least, Commissioner, in yours and in mine - the indefinite extension of cases would lead to the bankruptcy of distributors."
"Therefore, given that selective distribution is allowed, I would ask you whether, in order to achieve equality of prices between the different countries, it would not be more sensible, for example, to restrict this prohibition of the selective vendor selling exclusively to the final consumer or to other members of the network."
"That would favour parallel importers who would contribute to lowering prices."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for the clear account, and I am of the opinion that what is being proposed can optimise and improve the internal market principles."
"To that extent, I am in support of the proposals."
"The Anglo-Dutch example which the Commissioner quoted is related, inter alia, to the additional taxes which are being levied in each Member State."
"I know that taxes fall within the national competences, but I believe that the Commission is entitled to intervene if competition and internal market regulation are hindered."
"You state that you yourself are not responsible for taxation, but it is always the Commission that does the talking."
"If I therefore address the Commissioner, I assume that, formally, I am addressing the Commission and not specifically the Commissioner."
"I thus assume that you can take this message with you, as my Irish fellow MEP pointed out."
"In addition, I should like to ask why it is not possible to take a registered car from another Member State to the country where you live."
"In this way, far better use could, in fact, be made of the internal market."
"Commissioner, you have already heard many Members who believe that the approximation of prices must also be achieved by means of fiscal harmonisation, possibly more than by means of this regulation."
"The current regulation affects 100% of the distribution contracts."
"Nevertheless, you are establishing very tough limitation clauses in relation to the definition of a retailer."
"Do you not believe, Commissioner, that this new regulation could create legal uncertainty amongst dealers, which may also endanger the continuity of the investments they are making and, also, to a certain degree, the employment of these dealers throughout the European Union, who number more than one million people?"
"Are you not rather afraid that, with this policy of opening up competition, the large-scale distributors may benefit to the detriment of the small dealerships?"
"I will be brief."
"I want to welcome the announcement by the Commissioner."
"We will have to wait and see how it actually works in practice."
"The companies we are dealing with here are quite powerful."
"Does the Commissioner have an understanding with Member States that they will not top up their vehicle taxation as a means of recovering income lost as a result of lower prices, thereby wiping out the economic benefit to consumers?"
"In addition, would it be possible to make displaying or advertising pre-tax prices along with post-tax prices obligatory?"
"Generally we have post-tax prices advertised."
"Finally, what impact, if any, would this have on guaranteeing on a Europe-wide basis the car which may be bought in another state?"
"Mr President, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy considers it an important question as to what effects this will have on technical legislation, specifically with regard to on-board-diagnostics or the various interfaces."
"How, too, are we to ensure actual adherence to working standards and norms?"
"Is it envisaged that there will be some sort of third-party certification, with neutral third parties checking that the standards have actually been kept to?"
"In this area some action concerning taxation is important."
"The Commission has a role to play in this."
"I would remind you that the Commission's position for the Nice IGC was that there should be a shift to qualified-majority voting in those areas of taxation which are crucial for the functioning of the single market."
"I would not expect Member States to top up with higher taxes."
"They would face constraints in doing so."
"Will the new system bring about legal uncertainty for dealers?"
"I believe not - on the contrary."
"We are also confident of avoiding the sometimes-feared economic consequences for dealers and employment."
"The draft regulation offers former dealers the opportunity to become official repayers within the manufacturers' network and to locate where they wish."
"At any rate we already know that, this draft regulation aside, several manufacturers are planning to restructure and reduce the number of official network dealers in their systems."
"As to the European warranty, it remains in the proposal."
"Networks have to provide warranty, irrespective of where a car is bought."
"Thank you very much for your dedication and brevity, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0002/2002)."
"We are going to change the order of the first two questions in accordance with the Members and the Commissioners."
"Part I"
"Question No 39 by (H-0030/02):"
"Subject: Nuclear safety: Bulgaria's failure to comply with EU partnership agreement and agreements to decommission reactors at Kozloduy With regard to the decommissioning of units 1 and 2 of the nuclear plant at Kozloduy by the end of 2002, Mr Kovachev, the Bulgarian Energy Minister said on 8 January 2002 that his country will not be honouring its commitments to close down and dismantle the dangerous, old-style reactors, as provided by the revised partnership agreement between the European Union (EU) and Bulgaria, and the Sofia Memorandum, which Bulgaria signed with the Commission in 1999."
"How will the Commission ensure that the commitments contained in the partnership agreement to decommission units 3 and 4 will be honoured, and what stage has been reached in the decommissioning of units 1 and 2, given that all four units are unsafe and cannot be upgraded at reasonable cost?"
"Can Bulgaria ask for the opening of negotiations on the energy chapter under the pre-accession process when it refuses to honour its commitments to the EU on nuclear safety and has not drawn up a new energy strategy to bring it into line with free market rules (production and pricing) and the opening of the market to competition?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is unable to confirm the information according to which the Bulgarian government has announced its intention not to abide by the agreements entered into in respect of the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power station, nor can we attribute such a statement to the Bulgarian Energy Minister, Mr Kovatchiev."
"Differing opinions have in fact been expressed in political circles in Bulgaria during the current public debate on the closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power station - specifically of its units 1 to 4."
"Information available to the Commission indicates that, in a statement on 10 January 2002 on the early decommissioning of the four reactor blocks at Kozloduy, the Bulgarian Energy Minister mentioned 2008 or 2010 as possible dates for the closure of Blocks 3 and 4."
"The Bulgarian Energy Minister's statement did not refer to Blocks 1 and 2."
"The situation is that, in the agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government in 1999, we agreed on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 by 2002, that is this year, and that we would have discussions with the Bulgarian government on the decommissioning of Blocks 3 and 4 in connection with the revision of that country's energy strategy and that a decision on this would be reached before the date originally envisaged."
"The Commission made it clear that it understood this to mean that 3 and 4 would be decommissioned by 2006 at the latest."
"I must, though, say quite clearly that Bulgaria has not yet come to a formal decision on this matter."
"This means that we cannot, of course, complete the energy chapter of negotiations with Bulgaria as long as we do not have a definite decommissioning date set down for Blocks 3 and 4."
"The agreement I reached with the Bulgarian government at that time constitutes part of the European Union's common negotiating position in the energy chapter with regard to Kozloduy."
"It is clear, therefore, that this chapter cannot be completed without compliance with the content of this agreement."
"The matter is clear to that extent, and, on the Commission's behalf, I now repeat that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 of the nuclear power station at Kozloduy in accordance with the agreement entered into is an absolutely indispensable requirement for the conclusion of accession negotiations with the Republic of Bulgaria."
"Work has begun on the decommissioning of Blocks 1 and 2 and the right administrative and technical conditions are in place."
"As an international fund stands ready to finance these operations, I am working on the assumption that everything will go according to plan."
"I do not share the concern expressed by some that the decommissioning of reactor Blocks 1 to 4 will result in major economic difficulties, particularly as regards competitiveness."
"The Commission has calculated that Bulgaria has considerable over-capacity in energy production, and, as a new nuclear power station of modern design is being built, any loss to Bulgaria will be compensated for, and any problems are, in our view, perfectly capable of being surmounted."
"To sum up, we have not the least indication that Bulgaria will pull out of the commitment it has made."
"I would also like to expressly underline that the Bulgarian Prime Minister, at my most recent meeting with him, quite expressly confirmed to me that his government stands by the undertaking given by its predecessor."
"Commissioner, thank you for your reply confirming that reactors 1 and 2 will be shut down this year, in 2002, that work has in fact already started, and that reactors 3 and 4 will be shut down by 2006 at the latest, as originally agreed, as the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, has assured me in writing and as you have stressed repeatedly."
"I should like to ask you to keep up the pressure here because there will always be uncertainty about the security of supply. I should like to know exactly what the Commission has done about the single, interconnected operating system which could be used to exchange energy so that we do not have countries wondering what will happen now that reactors 1 to 4 at Kozloduy are to be shut down and whether or not they will be short of energy?"
"My second question concerns the loan granted to Bulgaria to bring reactors 5 and 6 up to Western safety standards."
"What has been done about reactors 5 and 6?"
"In order to avoid misunderstandings, I have to again tell you, Mr Trakatellis, in the clearest terms that there is as yet no binding promise by the Bulgarian government that Blocks 3 and 4 will be decommissioned by 2006; there is, rather, an agreement that the decision on decommissioning these blocks will be taken earlier than the Bulgarian government originally planned."
"The Commission stated in this communiqué that it understands that closure will take place by no later than 2006."
"Formal notification by the Bulgarian government is still required, but it is certain that that is on its way."
"Moreover, Mr Trakatellis, I have to tell you that energy provision in Bulgaria is a matter for the Bulgarian government."
"Nor is the issue of energy efficiency in the Balkans and Bulgaria's position in the energy market a matter within the immediate remit of the Commission."
"I can only reiterate our estimation that the decommissioning of Blocks 1 to 4 will not result in an energy shortage in Bulgaria, where there is, on the contrary, substantial overcapacity."
"I entirely agree with you that it is a matter of absolute necessity to inform the Bulgarian public in precise terms of the need for decommissioning and the measures that are to accompany this, as in fact - as you are no doubt well aware - the people of Bulgaria do not, as a whole, understand this requirement by the international community."
"We always behave as if these things were self-evident, and so I am grateful to you for addressing this point."
"The overwhelming majority of Bulgaria's population does not see it as at all self-evident that the country's largest and most important power station should be decommissioned under pressure from the international community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would be interested to know to which technical norms and standards the Commission actually refers when deciding which blocks are dangerous and have to be closed down."
"Mr Rübig, the Commission did nothing of the sort, and indeed it cannot."
"This was a political condition for the opening of negotiations with Bulgaria, one that was laid upon us by the Member States."
"This political condition was formulated by the Member States in consequence of an assessment carried out by the industrialised States as early as the beginning of the 1990s, in the course of which the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe was subjected to examination."
"This determined which of the nuclear power stations were seen by the Western industrialised States as incapable of being retrofitted at reasonable cost."
"I am, at the moment, unaware of what standards the States applied at the time."
"If you are interested, though, I would be happy to initiate the relevant research on your behalf."
"The Commission did not set any enquiries in motion, but performed its political function of achieving a result with the Bulgarian government as regards compliance with a political condition for the beginning of negotiations."
"I congratulate you, Commissioner, on always being allowed to make statements on such scintillating subjects, first Temelin and now Kozloduy."
"You must be a very happy man."
"May I ask how much a decommissioning of this sort costs?"
"What happens to the contaminated materials?"
"Who pays for it all?"
"How long does such decommissioning take?"
"What actually happens if there is some sort of mishap before 2006?"
"Who pays then?"
"Who bears the costs?"
"Following on from your answer to Mr Rübig's question, do you not also believe that we are yet again seeing how urgently necessary it is that we should have common European standards rather than always arriving at decommissioning dates by a process of rough estimation?"
"Blocks 3 and 4 in 2006 - that is what we have said now."
"Should we perhaps not make that 2004 or 2003?"
"What happens then if something goes wrong in 2005?"
"Madam, much as I regret it, the Commission bears no responsibility for the safety standards at nuclear power stations anywhere in the world, not even in Bulgaria."
"Even if I were able to answer your technical question, I would not be permitted to."
"Responsibility for the operation of the Kozloduy nuclear power station, for any safety problems connected with it and also for any accidents that might occur, is borne exclusively by the operator, that is, in this instance, the Republic of Bulgaria."
"I must also make it clear that the Commission is not in a position to take on any responsibility as we are not in a position either to have any influence on how this nuclear power station is operated."
"I have no personal view on how safe or dangerous this nuclear power station is."
"I am quite happy to give you detailed information on the technical processes involved as soon as such information is available to me."
"We have to work on the assumption that the time required to complete a project like the decommissioning of a nuclear power station, is to be reckoned in decades rather than years."
"That means that we are dealing here with a very long-term operation, which may, under certain circumstances, also involve long-term commitments or burdens on the Community budget."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"As the author is not present, Question No 38 lapses."
"We invite Mr Liikanen to take a seat in the front row."
"Part II Questions to Commissioner Liikanen"
"Question No 41 by (H-0054/02):"
"Subject: Improving the regulatory environment for SMEs The internal market is an ideal environment in which European undertakings can conduct business."
"However, some important obstacles to the free circulation of goods and services continue to hamper their operations."
"Given the need highlighted at the Lisbon Summit and in the European Charter for Small Enterprises for an improvement in the regulatory environment, further action in this regard is required."
"What steps is the Commission taking to that end?"
"Mr President, the internal market has been of huge benefit to companies, but still more can be done."
"Progress in this area is being watched within the framework of the Commission' s Internal Market Strategy for Services, approved in November 1999."
"The Commission examines the Internal Market Strategy each year to evaluate the results achieved and suggest improvements."
"The evaluation was last carried out in April."
"One of the aims is to improve the operational environment for companies and special attention is paid to helping small enterprises in much of the action that is taken in association with this aim."
"The Commission also monitors developments in the business climate for small enterprises with reference to the yearly report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises."
"The report for 2002 will be coming out in the next few days and will assess the action to help small businesses that the Member States and the Commission have said they are taking."
"The Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies to be held on 23 February in Aranjuez, in Spain, will be reporting on the conclusions of the report for 2002, and they will be submitted to the European Council when it convenes in Barcelona."
"At this stage I might say that there has been progress."
"Progress has been made, for example, in such areas as access to finance and the exchange of good practice."
"In addition, in December, an SME envoy was appointed whose task it will be to step up exchanges with small and medium-sized enterprises and their representative bodies."
"He will work in the Enterprise Directorate-General and his job will be to act as liaison officer on issues such as opportunities for SMEs to acquire funding and exploit innovation as well as matters to do with competitiveness, better regulation, implementation of the internal market process, participation in EU programmes and how best to enhance consultation procedures."
"Last year the Commission launched an initiative called 'Helping SMEs to go digital' . The aim is to make SMEs aware of the opportunities offered by information networks."
"Six events have been planned for this year in different Member States and there is to be a large-scale conference in Brussels."
"The Commission' s work to improve regulation is also making headway."
"There have been a number of proposals to improve the situation, both in a White Paper on Governance in the European Union and in the Laeken communication on improving and simplifying the regulatory environment."
"The proposals relate to the whole lifecycle of Community acts."
"Under discussion are, for example, the need for more effective consultation with interest groups and civil society, an evaluation of Community action and costs, and a simplification of current laws."
"By no later than June the Commission will have put forward a proposal for a straightforward action plan to simplify and improve the regulatory environment, after the Community' s institutions and other interest groups have been heard."
"The Enterprise Directorate-General will be actively involved in drawing up this plan and drawing on the experience gained from the business impact assessment system and the test project connected with it."
"The conclusions drawn, as a result of this project, will be ready this month."
"Commissioner, you have given me such a complete answer that I have few remaining doubts to ask you about."
"Nevertheless, I would like to insist that the measures he says are going to be adopted, above all in relation to the simplification of the regulations, be genuinely implemented and applied as quickly as possible."
"Great declarations, great words and great policies are all very well for existing undertakings, but it is essential that those who - inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit which we are so keen to promote - decide to create a new undertaking, are not faced with obstacles and difficulties which prevent them from going ahead."
"Furthermore, and in order that this policy may be truly effective, information on actions implemented by the Commission must reach the smaller entrepreneurs, a sector which very much needs it."
"Mr President, I agree with the honourable Member that words are words and only actions are important."
"When our report appears this week on the SME Charter it will present a picture of what has been done in Member States."
"It is very important for the Commission that we are able to present this year a thorough impact analysis of all new legislative proposals and that we know what the genuine costs to companies are, and that we always consider what the most simple solution might be."
"I am prepared to go back over this matter with the honourable Member in minute detail."
"But I agree: deeds are what is most important, whereas words are only good for a very short while."
"I would like to pick up on the Commissioner's last reply and I am delighted that he is talking about thorough impact assessment."
"I would like to put it to him that at the moment impact assessments that we receive attached to Commission proposals in many cases are not thoroughly done, they are not looking at the full implications, they are not necessarily independent."
"Would he agree with me that it is vital to have an interinstitutional arrangement for independent impact assessment so that when proposals come through this House and colleagues add burdens on business they are properly costed?"
"Also, when the Council adds provisions to Commission proposals in common position, they should be properly costed too?"
"Would he not share my view that this is the sort of bold proposal we want to see?"
"I have to say that the proposals we have seen so far from the Commission on regulatory assessment are far too timid."
"I share Mr Harbour's view that there is a lot to improve in the impact assessment."
"For that reason, when I took office I launched a project to create more solid methodologies for business impact assessment."
"The results of this work are ready now in February."
"Alongside this, the Commission proposed at the Göteborg Summit the need for sustainable impact assessments, which means impact assessments that include economic, social and environmental factors."
"This work is now proceeding inside the Commission and is led by the Secretary-General."
"I fully agree that we must have predictable accepted methodologies so that anybody can assess how we have come to these conclusions."
"The Commission is ready to open the debate on these issues and to appear before the respective committees, for instance, to discuss what we have learned in our business impact assessments."
"The Commission appreciates the importance of both business and sustainable impact assessments and the need to achieve them quickly."
"Secondly, of course it does not mean that measures will not be taken if costs are incurred but we should at least try to assess the costs honestly and then an informed decision can be taken."
"Mr Crowley arrived immediately before I gave him the floor."
"If you wish to ask your question, the Commissioner will reply."
"Question No 40 by Brian Crowley (H-0025/02):"
"Subject: Improving the business environment in 2002 and creating an inclusive eSociety"
"Will the Commission outline its proposals for 2002 aimed at improving the business environment, including for small and very small businesses, and will it indicate its time-scale for bringing forward the promised new initiatives aimed at consolidating the move towards an inclusive 'eSociety' ?"
"The European Commission will publish within a week the annual report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises."
"Through the annual report we monitor progress on the environment for small businesses."
"The 2002 report evaluates actions reported by the Member States and the Commission in favour of small businesses."
"The conclusions of the report will be presented to the Conference of European Ministers responsible for SME policies on 23 February and submitted to the European Council."
"As I have already said, the report shows signs of increasing political commitment and major progress has been made in the field of access to finance."
"Progress has also been made in exchanges of good practice such as cutting red tape in company creation."
"As regards the efforts of SMEs to adapt their business practices to the global knowledge-based economy, the Commission launched last year the GoDigital initiative for SMEs as part of the eEurope Action Plan."
"In some countries this report has received a very positive welcome."
"We are organising campaigns throughout the European countries at the moment."
"Before the end of 2002 a portal to provide SMEs with legal information, guidance and advice will be set up."
"The Commission has also just today adopted a Communication on eEurope Benchmarking, where you can follow how SMEs are being connected and how broadly they use eCommerce."
"This Commission communication highlights new challenges in relation to Internet usage: broadband is needed to stimulate new services; schools are connected but the Internet is not yet sufficiently part of the pedagogical process; governments online have to move towards full electronic transactions."
"The indicators include amongst others Internet penetration in business and the percentage of companies selling online."
"While good progress has been made, the take-up of eCommerce is not as fast as expected."
"This confirms the relevance of actions such as GoDigital, but also indicates the urgent need to identify obstacles to eCommerce amongst especially small companies as well as consumers. eEurope should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus towards effective usage and availability of the Internet for all citizens and businesses."
"The communication on the impact of the e-Economy on European enterprises contains proposals to deepen cooperation between all relevant stakeholders to develop a policy agenda for maximising the benefits of the e-Economy for European enterprises, taking into account the needs of SMEs."
"The Industry Council endorsed this proposal in December 2001 and invited the Commission and the Member States to intensify the debate on the e-Economy."
"The Spanish Presidency has decided to launch a policy debate with Member States to agree future priorities for the promotion of the e-Economy in Europe and to address this topic at the Industry Council meeting in early June."
"To this end it will be necessary to identify policy changes at national and European level to adapt to the needs of the e-Economy."
"These activities will be developed in close cooperation with the reflections and the preparatory work relating to the future of the eEurope Action Plan."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this electronic Europe project met with enormous difficulties when spectrum auctions started to be held."
"It resulted in bankruptcies, which are still continuing, and unemployment."
"What do you intend to do to prevent this from happening in the future, with certain Member States collecting charges against the general intentions of the e-Europe project - at the same time leading the sector into a wild downward spiral - and others not?"
"Mr President, last December - thanks to the European Parliament' s swift action - new legislation was passed on all electronic communication."
"For the first time it also contains a legal basis for spectra."
"It allows for the creation of what are now new bodies: a committee, to discuss long-term questions, and a working party, to consider the current administration."
"Now that we have a common legal basis and joint bodies, it will be possible to discuss common aims beforehand and coordinate action."
"This is obviously no guarantee that everyone in the end will choose the same approach, but I hope that we can at least agree together policies in an open and transparent way and that before the first State starts dividing up the spectra the rules will be known to all."
"The market will be able to act more wisely when it is known at least how things are moving in different regions of Europe."
"I believe that the sort of bedlam we experienced last time will not repeat itself, but it cannot always be guaranteed that common sense will prevail at all times."
"As the author is not present, Question No 42 lapses."
"Question No 43 by (H-0042/02):"
"Subject: eEurope 2002 initiative The Spanish Presidency, in its published work programme, notes that the 'eEurope 2002 initiative will have to be relaunched with new objectives'."
"Can the Commission explain why a strategy launched only two years ago is now in need of a 'relaunch', indicate the reasons for the failure of the original strategy and outline the objectives that the new strategy seeks to achieve?"
"I should first of all like to thank Mr Harbour for keeping e-Europe high on the European agenda."
"When we look back at the year 2000 we can see that the e-Europe action plan really rewrote the European political agenda."
"The idea was to set clear targets for the EU and Member States, clear deadlines and follow it up."
"Has this idea worked?"
"I think it has."
"To give you a few examples: the telecoms package and unbundling the local loop."
"We would never have been able to imagine these rapid procedures without high priority being given to information society."
"Internet penetration has increased."
"It was 18% in March 2000 and 38% in December 2001 - more than double."
"Nearly 90% of schools are now connected to the Internet."
"Today 90% of European enterprises have Internet access."
"We now have the fastest research network in the world."
"The start of progress in getting government on-line is well under way."
"A comprehensive overview is now available."
"It was accepted today in the Commission."
"I am happy to pass it on to Members of Parliament."
"What are the new challenges?"
"First of all, Internet penetration has risen sharply but is still very unevenly distributed across Europe."
"Schools are massively connected but still the number of pupils per on-line PC varies enormously."
"We must have more PCs at school per student."
"Even though businesses are more and more connected the reorganisation of business procedures is only starting."
"Business consumer e-commerce is still rather small."
"Governments have started enthusiastically to go on-line."
"Normally there is a question about presenting activities on their website."
"Real interactivity is still rare."
"All the interactivities give better services to citizens and increase the productivity of the public sector."
"The Commission has not come to the end of its actions because technology moves quickly."
"Broadband Internet is now a real option."
"Broadband is the essential physical infrastructure of the knowledge society."
"Without broadband we will not deliver fully Lisbon."
"Other nations have already made their choices for broadband."
"The Commission's report to the Barcelona Summit said: ""Broadband Internet access will be a key factor for improving the performance of the economy."
"Broadband networks will form the backbone of an increasingly interconnected and integrated society. E-Europe should be continued beyond 2002 and shift its focus more towards effective usage and availability of the Internet."""
"The Commission is particularly happy that the Spanish Presidency shares this analysis and has put the launch of e-Europe 2005 action plan on its agenda."
"The first discussion on a possible new action plan will take place at the informal telecoms council in Vitoria in Spain on 22 and 23 February 2002."
"The Commission is ready to go into pro-dialogue also with the relevant committees in the European Parliament."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for a wide-ranging reply and I note that two of the central achievements are those which Parliament has pushed through very strongly."
"However, my concern is not the work that he has done - for which I commend him very much - but rather, for example, the delays and problems that Member States are experiencing in transposing the electronic commerce directive, passed by this House with great speed."
"Similarly, I see that as regards copyright in the Information Society - another fundamental plank in the legislation that he does not mention - discussion is continuing on ideas for new levies on computer disks and other issues that will fundamentally hold back the development of the e-society."
"Does he share my considerable concern that Member States do not appear to be taking anything like seriously enough the fundamental principles that he has enunciated and would he give us some indication that he will give positive vent to them at the forthcoming meetings?"
"Will the Commission publish evaluation reports on both of these issues so that we in this House can put some political pressure on Member States to get on with it?"
"The two directives on electronic commerce and copyright are extremely important."
"It is the Commission's duty to ensure that Member States transpose them into their law."
"They are both within the remit of my colleague, Mr Bolkestein, but we are cooperating here and I am ready to contact him after Question Time."
"On the matter of copyright, the Commission is organising a workshop in the next few weeks on digital rights management technologies."
"When content is sold on line it is very important to guarantee a system where the copyright holder can receive proper royalties for his production."
"New technologies like digital rights management are helpful there."
"My personal wish is that this technology could result in more targeted methods to get proper revenue for copyright holders so that Member States would not need to go for these very broad untargeted solutions such as copyright levy."
"Finally, on the follow-up of the Member States, there is often a problem that progress is piecemeal and there is not sufficiently strong coordination in Member States to guarantee that progress will take place in all areas."
"That will be one of the issues we will raise at the next informal Council and we will pass this challenge to European Council in Barcelona."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what does the Commission intend to do about the threat that the digital divide will increase, because it affects people who are also financially badly off?"
"Secondly, the usage rate of Internet connections amongst us in Europe is low."
"What does the Commission intend to do about this?"
"Thirdly, the development of content here in Europe is also slow."
"It is nevertheless the key to greater action in the spirit of e-Europe."
"How do you intend to tackle this?"
"All these issues are extremely important."
"I have just a few remarks."
"Schools are well placed to bridge the digital divide."
"Through them we can guarantee education for all."
"In Europe comprehensive school systems still work."
"We can guarantee skills for everybody."
"When the Internet comes to homes via children we can avoid the divide from the start."
"But we must also look to the older age groups."
"Here, the combined efforts of the public sector in training, public access points which can be run by local communities, post offices and the private sector provide extremely important backup."
"Here I hope all Member States will take active measures."
"As regards usage, we are now discussing flat rates in general."
"In America, higher usage is often explained by the fact that there are more flat-rate offers on the market, not only for broadband but also for narrow bands."
"We have not reached a final conclusion on this, but this question is being raised now, as we have seen a tail-off in demand for broadband in the form of ADSL and cable."
"Should that be a solution?"
"I will reply to that after we have done some more internal work."
"As for content, if the Internet is not in your own mother tongue it will be not the Internet for all."
"The Commission is now implementing its programme, eContent, which concentrates on multilingual and multicultural platforms in the content area."
"It brings together different operators from different Member States."
"There has been huge interest and it is doing fine."
"The Information Society Technologies Programme is shifting attention towards applications."
"In the future the user will be at the centre."
"We have often put technology at the centre, but we must now put the user at the centre instead."
"Users are not looking for technology, but rather for content, services and applications."
"For that reason the attention of research is moving in that direction."
"The Commission supports these efforts."
"Mr President, the UMTS licences were auctioned for very large sums."
"What effect will that have on digital television licences?"
"I believe that new jobs have been created precisely by these initiatives, which also involve very substantial investments."
"What view do you take of the development of risk capital in this field?"
"To be honest, Mr Rübig, last year was not an easy one for the risk capital market."
"The venture capital market developed very rapidly in 2000, then we saw the difficulties and it went down."
"At EU level, the European Investment Funds invested in venture capital funds in various Member States."
"These investments were well-timed because of the lack of venture financing."
"We have also been using Community budget funds, with part of the multiannual programme credits transferred into the investment funds."
"Through these efforts the public sector has been playing its role."
"At the same time it is very important to complete the legislation on a genuine internal market for financial services and risk capital."
"In this regard we hope that the solutions resulting from the Lamfalussy report will be very useful."
"Today on the Internet I saw some good news: some new venture rounds for wireless applications have been completed."
"Perhaps the worst is over, but the market is still very tight compared to the situation in the past."
"So all such measures, an active financial market and public support measures, if there is market failure, will be needed."
"Thank you very much for your cooperation, Commissioner."
"Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou"
"Mr Alavanos's question concerns the Lisbon targets and whether or not Greece will be able to attain them."
"First, the target of full employment set in Lisbon was a political commitment by leaders of the Member States, not a binding legal commitment."
"Except that the political commitment was also highly significant and all the national action plans for employment have been drawn up and submitted on the basis of that commitment."
"In Greece, the second Community Support Framework applied over the last five years was completed in December 2001, so it is difficult to make an overall evaluation of it."
"Naturally, the job market was reformed and training and proactive employment policy structures and mechanisms were created during the course of the second Community Support Framework."
"The problem lies with the employment services which Greece started to reform at the end of the second Community Support Framework."
"As far as the third Community Support Framework is concerned, Greece is one of the few Member States which has set quantitative national targets under its national action plan, having announced a target of 61.5% for 2005."
"The third Community Support Framework includes a hefty 2.9 trillion drachmas to fund pro-active employment policies and reforms."
"The implementation of the third Community Support Framework is a huge challenge if Greece is to introduce the mechanisms needed for employment policy, such as an individualised approach, because the Greek national employment agencies need to be completely overhauled and training mechanisms need to work more efficiently and be geared to regional development objectives."
"The Commission is working closely with all the Member States and, as you know, it repeats the guidelines every year so that the Member States can take account of European agreements on the application of employment policies."
"Commissioner, I know you are a supporter of English as our official language, so I shall put my question in English."
"By chance, I have before me Eurostat's statistics on the economy labour market."
"Total unemployment in the European Union in 1990 was 7.7%; in 2000 it was 8.4%."
"In 1990 unemployment in Greece stood at 6.3%, less than in the Community."
"In 2000 it was 11.1%, the second highest rate after Spain."
"In Ireland, unemployment in 1990 was 13.1%; in 2000 it was 4.4%."
"Ireland and Greece are both cohesion countries."
"How do you explain that, and what critical view would you take of the Greek Government's actions during the second Community support framework?"
"First, may I thank you for your support."
"I knew that a progressive person of your experience would agree that English - and our mastering it in Greece - are very important."
"As far as the statistics which you quoted are concerned, we need to analyse the structure of unemployment in Greece."
"The rate of employment for men is exactly the same as the European average, but there is a huge difference in the rate of employment for women, which is 40% in Greece, compared with a Community average of 56%."
"Similarly, there is a very serious youth unemployment problem."
"Here too, in comparison with other countries, unemployment is very high among the young in Greece, 29%, mainly because the various types of part-time employment found in numerous countries, including the country you referred to, are counted as full-time jobs."
"According to the Commission's recommendations, what the Greek government needs to do is to focus more on policies for women and young people and on policies for older workers, because here again very few older workers are actually in employment."
"These are the three main employment policy problems and, according to the national action plan which it has submitted, this is where the Greek government has focused its efforts."
"Of course, the Commission will continue to make recommendations where policies have not progressed as the Greek government promised, as it did in September this year and will again next September."
"Question No 45 by (H-0008/02):"
"Subject: Employment in Greece According to the Recommendation for a Council Recommendation on the Implementation of Member States' Employment Policies (COM(2001)0512/final), Greece continues to have one of the lowest employment rates in the European Union, and unemployment in Greece has stabilised at 11%, which is considerably above the EU average."
"These data show that the labour market suffers from structural problems, a finding borne out by the Commission Communication on structural indicators."
"According to this Communication, Greek indicators concerning entrepreneurial expenditure on R&D, access to the internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are the lowest of all the Member States."
"Will the Commission say whether, following the Council Recommendation and the Commission Communication, Greece has taken any specific additional measures or initiatives concerning the above sectors with a view to promoting employability and improving its position?"
"I should like to start, Mr President, with the tables of indicators announced by the Commission in its most recent communication, which will be sent to Barcelona."
"It is true, as the honourable Member says in his question, that Greece's indicators on matters such as entrepreneurial expenditure on research and development, access to the Internet, lifelong learning and public spending on education are lower than those of other Member States."
"However, I should like to point out that the Commission's philosophy behind these annual indicators is not just to compare the situation between Member States which do not always have the same points of reference; it is to look at the progress made by Member States from one year to the next."
"If we take the indicator for Internet access, Greece has progressed from 4.5% last year to 11% this year."
"These are the main objectives for the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006."
"In other words, there are operational programmes for education, vocational training, lifelong learning, the information society and the dissemination of the information society in both the public administration and the business sector."
"This is one of the major challenges of the Greek government's national action plan and the Community Support Framework."
"Of course, we must not forget that these programmes have substantial Community funds, but that alone is not enough."
"Very substantial national funds are needed, together with efficient, urgent policies, especially for the information society, if these indicators are to improve significantly by next year."
"Thank you, Commissioner, you are of course quite right."
"What counts is the progress made from one year to the next and that is precisely why I should like to ask you if any indicators apart from the Internet, which you referred to, have improved?"
"And secondly, as regards the third Community Support Framework, which makes provision for all the major budget items which you mentioned, has Greece actually started spending any money?"
"We are already more or less at the end of the second year."
"Thirdly, I should like to ask a question which I have been asking repeatedly for several years now, Commissioner, because I have been unable to obtain a reply."
"Has anyone ever - not last year or the year before, because that would be impossible - but let us say five years ago; has anyone ever actually counted how many jobs have been created over a period of time from funds budgeted for job creation, just to give us a snapshot of exactly how efficient it is."
"Question No 46 by (H-0035/02):"
"Subject: Undeclared work in Greece In 1998, the Commission published a communication aimed at launching a dialogue among the Member States with a view to combating undeclared work which, according to data at the time, accounted for some 15% of the Union's GDP, while in Greece and Italy the figure exceeded 20% of GDP."
"Recent investigations by the Greek authorities, together with other available data, reveal that 10.5% of businesses are not registered with the Social Security Institution and that the percentage of non-registered workers fluctuates between 21% and 30%, resulting in a loss of billions of euro from the public purse and, in particular, the social insurance funds."
"What commitments did the Member States make as a result of the dialogue launched in 1998?"
"What progress has been made?"
"What are Greece's commitments and what recommendations have been made to that country?"
"What measures will the Commission take to combat undeclared work, in the context of the qualitative employment policy and the open coordination method, to ensure that pension schemes remain viable?"
"Mr President, may I assure the honourable Member that the European Commission shares her concerns about the impact of undeclared work, the impact of losses on the public purse, the impact on the job market and the impact on the pension system."
"The guidelines issued by the Commission in 2001 for 2002 call on the Member States to take measures to combat undeclared work and to encourage registration using a variety of means, such as regulatory measures, incentives, reforms of the tax system, allowances, collaboration with the social partners and special plans for relations between the social partners, between employers and employees."
"Greece's response does, I think, bode well for the future."
"By which I mean that the Greek authorities have introduced a series of measures dealing mainly with work inspectors, controls carried out by inspectors and the auditing agencies of the various insurance funds have been tightened up and, according to our information, a further 120 work inspectors are to be deployed."
"The commitments made by the Greek government in its national action plan also include a series of other measures dealing with allowances, that is, incentives to register low-paid workers, the results of which will not transpire until a later date, once they have been applied."
"On 26 February, the Commission is due to present the study started following the 1998 communication to which you refer. Experts from all the Member States will attend this conference and the presentation of the study to discuss efficient practices for dealing with undeclared work which have brought in significant results in certain countries."
"As far as the impact on pension schemes is concerned, I should point out that one of the parameters for combating the problem of the viability of pension funds is to increase employment."
"Not to increase employment generally any old how, but to increase employment which pays statutory tax and insurance contributions."
"This is the only way of boosting the funds and helping them to stabilise their finances."
"The open method of coordination established between the Member States does not, I repeat, involve any legal commitment vis-à-vis the Member States."
"Political commitments have been made and the Member States are due to submit pension reform plans, together with their economic and social implications, in September 2002."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"I do not share your optimism about progress because, as we can see in Greece and Italy - and I refer here to Greece in particular because it is my own country - there has been no progress."
"Twenty-five percent of unregistered workers alone are foreigners, in which case there is hardly any justification for the mass influx of unskilled foreign workers into Greece."
"Do you really believe, with this situation, that the ambitious targets set by the European Commission can be achieved, or should you be calling for means over and above political commitment, the means which countries need to have if they are to make progress?"
"Because undeclared work impacts not just on pension schemes, it also impacts on free competition and, of course, protection for workers, because we are hardly talking high-powered jobs here."
"I ask you in all honesty, do you feel that the means which you have at your disposal right now are sufficient to stamp out this phenomenon and its many and varied implications?"
"I must stress, Mr President, that the Commission is not a superstate and it cannot judge policies which are purely national policies and for which each Member State takes the specific measures which it feels it needs to take."
"What takes place at European level on this particular issue is collaboration between the Member States, through the guidelines, in which undeclared work is a priority and, naturally, steps have also been taken in countries such as Italy which have serious problems."
"Steps have been taken within an institutional framework to increase incentives to register workers and integrate immigrants."
"My evaluation of the measures taken by the Greek government, which is why I was cautious, is that its reaction bodes well in that it has introduced a series of institutional measures which are now under way, such as integrating immigrants and paying companies incentives for low-paid workers and, once they have been implemented, these institutional reforms should bring in positive results."
"As you know, the measures taken by government are evaluated every year and the guidelines contain the Commission's input."
"As you know, Commissioner, where there is undeclared work there are usually undeclared businesses."
"So I think we should be discussing not how many people have not been registered with social security agencies but how many businesses have not been registered at all, either with the Ministry of Trade or the police."
"Nowhere."
"There are sectors in Greece in which this is the rule rather than the exception."
"And their economic raison d'être is that no one knows about them."
"Of course, the Commission does not interfere in internal affairs in the Member States and rightly so."
"But I do still wonder if companies in general can get away without registering from the point of view of Community legislation?"
"Is there nothing the Commission can do about this during the course of its duties?"
"As you said, this is a matter in which it is very difficult for the European Commission to intervene."
"The registration of companies, which is the top priority for a country as far as its tax system, that is, its revenue is concerned, and as far as its social security system, that is, pensions are concerned, is obviously a priority for the Member States and I do not think that any recommendations are needed along these lines."
"I can only hope, from the information at our disposal, that the computerisation of the Social Security Institution, the law on regional companies and certain reforms along these lines will bring in results."
"Question No 47 by (H-0015/02):"
"Subject: Transfer of unemployment entitlements Under the provisions of Regulation (EEC) 1408/71, employees who are nationals of EU Member States may acquire unemployment benefit entitlements in any Member State."
"Immigrant workers, from non-Community countries, who wish to receive unemployment benefits in an EU Member State other than their country of residence are not entitled to do so under the terms of the Regulation, which does not allow them to transfer their entitlements."
"How can you justify the fact that employees from non-EEC countries are not entitled to unemployment benefits if they change their country of residence despite having paid contributions like other employees?"
"Why are they not allowed to make use of forms E301 and E303 to transfer unemployment entitlements?"
"Regulation 1408/71 and Regulation 574/72 protect the social security rights of workers by coordinating the different national social security systems of Member States."
"There are two main rights that workers have through these regulations."
"Firstly they have the right to unemployment benefit; secondly, to look for employment in another Member State and to continue to receive unemployment benefit for a maximum period of three months."
"However, this regulation applies to workers who are Community nationals."
"In 1997 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council to extend the scope of this regulation to workers who are third-country nationals."
"The same extension had been included in the larger frame of the Commission proposal of 1998 to modernise and simplify Regulation 1408/71."
"There were many discussions over many years."
"There was a very complicated discussion in the Council of Ministers."
"There were many disagreements between the Member States."
"The main obstacles to progress in this regard had been the lack of agreement on the legal base."
"It is not a legalistic or technical problem, it is a political one."
"But the difference in the legal base concerned first the Commission's proposal, which was based on the implementation of Articles 42 and 308, and certain Member States which considered that the basis of this proposal could be Article 63."
"The political difference is that under the last article there are some Member States that have the right to opt out of the regulation."
"Under the Belgian Presidency the Council of 3 December 2001 unanimously agreed that the basis which must be used is Article 63."
"So the Commission will very shortly present a new proposal to extend Regulation 1408/71 to third-country nationals using this new basis of Article 63."
"As far as the substance is concerned, I must highlight the Commission's agreement with your concept."
"I should just like to make one comment: it is the employers, the bosses, who are forcing these workers to move into other national territories."
"Workers are good for paying taxes, they are good for having profit sweated out of them, but there is no need for them to understand their minimum rights."
"This is totally unacceptable."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 48, 49 and 50, by Mr Fitzsimons, Mr Korakas and Mrs Thors respectively, will be replied to in writing."
"Questions to Commissioner Patten"
"As the author is not present, Question No 51 lapses."
"Question No 52 by (H-0960/01):"
"Subject: Reconstruction of Afghanistan and improving the subhuman situation of women What specific action or programmes is the Commission preparing in order to improve the situation of women in Afghanistan?"
"How will it ensure that women actually receive the aid and benefits intended for them?"
"The Commission is very much aware of the need to improve the situation of women in post-Taliban Afghanistan."
"Our initial EUR 57 m commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan includes specific provision for this."
"The Commission services are currently finalising contracts with NGOs and UN aid agencies to implement 18 projects worth EUR 25 m and programmes to support internally displaced Afghan people and refugees."
"Gender is a cross-cutting issue in all projects funded from the Aid to Uprooted People budget."
"In 2001 more than 50% of the projects directed at health, education and refugee care had specific and significant gender components."
"The Commission is currently assessing project proposals for the 2002 budget for uprooted people."
"The amount envisaged is EUR 24 m."
"In the new political situation in Afghanistan the Commission is planning to open an office in Kabul in February or March this year."
"This office will further enhance the Commission's ability to oversee the performance and delivery of its aid to Afghanistan."
"ECHO reopened its office at the beginning of last month."
"Regarding the humanitarian aid provided by ECHO, women are involved in various types of projects; all medical and nutritional projects funded by ECHO aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as to monitor the health status of women, in particular lactating and pregnant women."
"NGOs generally organise elementary hygiene education for women."
"NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medically related programmes."
"Medical NGOs play a great role in the training of women."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask a supplementary question which focuses on two aspects."
"Firstly, will women manage some of this economic aid?"
"Secondly, since there are specific risks for women - just today a girl of seven has been sold into marriage by her family in order to deal with hunger and meet their needs - I would like to know whether the Commission intends to create specific funds to prevent this type of violation of women' s rights."
"Given the situation I have described, which will no doubt be repeated tomorrow and the next day, I would like a concrete reply from the Commission."
"It is also very important to know whether women will manage these funds."
"The fact that there are many armed men very much hinders progress in the improvement of the situation of women."
"The simple answer to the very important first question that the honourable Member asked is an unequivocal yes."
"Not least do we hope that women will be centrally involved in a great deal of our development activity, but there are women in the interim administration."
"I hope there will be in the transitional administration."
"Women played a crucial role, let us not forget, in the success of the Bonn talks in December and we will be doing what we can to support the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs which will, I hope, be a good example of women managing programmes to help develop society and to help protect the role of women in a society which has abused them for far too long."
"The honourable Member asked a question about the specific security of women and young girls."
"In the light of recent well-publicised events, I wholly understand that."
"I hope that the overall improvement in the security situation and the increasing grip of the interim authority with our support will help to prevent things like that happening."
"But after the ferocious talibanisation of Afghan society over the last few years, and given the position of the country where warlordism is still rife, it is going to be some time before we can promote the sort of strong gender policies we would like to see."
"However, we will do all that we can."
"I am greatly encouraged by what the honourable Member has said."
"As the author is not present, Question No 53 lapses."
"Question No 54 by (H-0965/01):"
"Subject: Reform of the Stability Pact In light of the joint statement made by Patten and Solana on the reform of the Stability Pact, what is the Commission doing to ensure that the programme becomes more effective in the delivery of its services and in streamlining its personnel?"
"The High Representative and I wrote to ministers in November setting out proposals for the future work of the Stability Pact."
"Our main aim was to take the opportunity, two and a half years into the work of the pact, and with the arrival of a new special coordinator, to build on its achievements by enhancing the complementarity between the work of the Stability Pact and the EU stabilisation and association process, by focusing the pact's activities as tightly as possible and by putting a particular emphasis on encouraging regional cooperation."
"The General Affairs Council approved the recommendations in our letter on 19 November and asked the new Special Coordinator, Dr Buseck, who took up the reins on 1 January, to assess the current activities and working methods of the pact and to identify five or six objectives to be achieved by the end of this year."
"The Council asked him to report back to its meeting on 11 March."
"The Commission is now working closely with the Special Coordinator in the preparation of this report."
"Detailed consultations are taking place within the informal consultative committee which was established following the High Representative's and my own recommendations in order to improve coordination between the pact and the stabilisation and association process."
"Two meetings have already taken place: on 11 and 31 January."
"In conclusion, work is well in hand."
"The Stability Pact and the Commission are working very closely together to deliver the improvements the honourable Member refers to."
"I have every confidence that the report which Dr Buseck gives to the Council on 11 March will set out a number of practical proposals to that end."
"I thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"I am slightly perturbed that it seems to be taking so long to get this matter addressed."
"As we have just heard, it is not going to be until 11 March that we get further developments."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner, first, what measures are going to be recommended which will increase ownership by local people on the ground in the Stability Pact."
"It has been seen as remote and, unless we have proper ownership, quite frankly it will continue to be remote."
"Secondly, one of the areas of concern has been the quality of implementation in the Stability Pact."
"Is he happy that we are moving in the right direction in terms of implementation?"
"Thirdly, there is a view that there was a chronic lack of information on the ground about the Stability Pact."
"Is a strategy being put in place to deal with that?"
"As regards the first point, Dr Buseck is well aware of the problem to which the honourable Member referred."
"The proposals he brings forward on 11 March will reflect that awareness of his."
"The honourable Member will know that he is extremely experienced in dealing with the problems of the region and in particular in mobilising private sector support."
"I am looking forward very keenly to working with him."
"He will do an excellent job and he will want to engage with others who are working alongside him in an enthusiastic and transparent way."
"On implementation, it is fair to say that overall we have established an impressive record as far as the Commission is concerned in implementing what we have promised to do in the western Balkans and in south-east Europe as a whole."
"What we have been able to achieve in Serbia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in other countries, is impressive."
"I hope that we will be able to ensure that where there have been any bottlenecks affecting infrastructure projects with the Stability Pact - and sometimes those bottlenecks are the result of problems in the beneficiary countries - we will be able to resolve them."
"Dr Buseck and I are trying to focus on those problem projects and get them moving as rapidly as possible."
"As for information about what is happening on the ground, that is an issue which Dr Buseck is well aware of."
"We will help him to address it, trying to ensure that the publicity for the achievements of the Stability Pact goes to the pact, rather than to individuals."
"It is a pleasure to work with Dr Buseck."
"I think he will do outstandingly well and he can certainly count on our understanding and support and, I am sure, the understanding and support of Parliament, in the efforts he makes in the future."
"Question No 55 by (H-0002/02):"
"Subject: Aid to Asia and Latin America Given the European Parliament's amendment to the 2002 budget that 35 per cent of EU external assistance is allocated to social infrastructure, mainly basic education and health; and given Commissioner Patten's letter to the President of the Committee on Development and Cooperation of December 2001, that 'the Commission is willing to implement the budget on this basis. . . understand(ing) that the Parliament's focus is on the overall picture for EC assistance rather than the global performance of all donors'; what precise measures will the Commission take to operationalise this decision in relation to the regional budget lines providing aid to Asia and to Latin America?"
"Can the Commission reply with respect to communication with its delegations, the mechanism for agreement of Country Strategy Papers, the operation of its Quality Support Group, dialogue with partners, as well as in any other respects?"
"In the context of the 2002 budget, the Commission has supported a benchmark that 35% of spending in Development Assistance Committee Group 1 countries, including macroeconomic assistance with social sector conditionality, is allocated to social infrastructure, mainly education and health."
"This recognises that the Community contribution must be seen as part of the overall donor support in a given country and that a degree of flexibility must be the norm."
"The Commission is committed to work towards meeting this benchmark in assistance to the social sectors in all its programmes, including Asia and Latin America."
"With a view to honouring this commitment, a number of initiatives will be undertaken."
"In particular, these will include, first, improved emphasis on the social sector in all Commission programmes, in line with the priorities in the Community's development strategy."
"Second, the establishment during 2002 - and I know this is a point on which the honourable Member has himself laid great emphasis - of a solid statistical basis allowing DAC sectoral classification of programmes and projects from 2002."
"A reclassification exercise of all 2001 commitments will be undertaken with a view to enabling comparison to be made."
"Third, we want to make available to Parliament all approved country strategy papers, including multiannual programmes and associated financial envelopes."
"Finally, the continuation during 2002 of work on the definition of internationally agreed performance indicators and implementation of sector-wide programmes in the social sector. The Commission is in contact, as the honourable Member knows, with Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the organisation of a seminar in the spring of this year, where the Commission will report on progress made in these areas and, I hope, continue to gain from the experience and enthusiasm and commitment of the members of the Development Committee, including, of course, the honourable Member."
"The last time I debated with Mr Patten on this subject in committee he accused me of having an overdose of testosterone."
"I am glad he has not repeated that tonight."
"Stamina is what we need in dealing with this issue."
"He is right in saying that there are a number of areas of agreement between the Commission and Parliament, not least in the DAC reporting where progress is such that we very much welcome it."
"We welcome too their cooperation in relation to the seminar."
"I am concerned that the emphasis in his answer was on definitions, about reporting, about statistics - i.e. analysis - rather than the tougher decisions that are equally required to shift resources."
"It is important that we do not simply talk about the process in terms of information being available - important as that is, and agreed as we are on that issue - but that the Commissioner actually tells us, as those country strategy papers are passed, as the Quality Support Group evaluates new programmes, as delegations (and he did not answer the point about the role of delegations in this) take their decisions, as new staff are recruited, how will he ensure that real resources are allocated in greater number to basic health and basic education?"
"We need to see some shift of resources during the course of this year."
"Give us some hope that it will happen."
"First of all I am not against testosterone in trying to achieve some progress in this area."
"We need to show a great deal of energy and commitment."
"Secondly, as far as the role of delegations is concerned, as the honourable Member knows, I place particular emphasis, on the deconcentration exercise, which is a particularly ill-starred, euro-gabble way of referring to trying to manage our programmes in the field and as closely as possible to the people whom we want to see benefit from them."
"The delegations will play a key role in drawing up the country strategy papers, which will have to reflect the priorities of our development philosophy and development strategy."
"The honourable Member asks us to give him hope that we will be seeing a real shift."
"The purpose of providing a better statistical basis for analysing and planning what we are doing is to demonstrate that we are making an effort to achieve the objectives which the honourable Member and I have in common and which are also the objectives of my distinguished colleague, Commissioner Nielsen."
"So there would be no point for example in the CRIS exercise in which we are engaged if we were not intending it to have an impact on policy."
"I think the honourable Member accepts that one is looking for steady trends, rather than being too nailed down to specific figures in specific years in specific countries."
"One wants to see a shift of emphasis and a clear indication that the Commission's programmes are as associated as other peoples' with the objectives of poverty alleviation."
"I will make one additional point, which I attempted to make yesterday morning in the parliament of the country I know best."
"There is still a tendency when people look at what we are doing to compare apples with oranges."
"It is very often the case that other countries or Member States appear to have a far higher proportion of development assistance committed to poverty alleviation than we do because they look at what we are doing in the Balkans, in Russia, in the NIS, in parts of the Mediterranean, and compare it as though it was exactly the same as our more straightforward development assistance programmes."
"Because we are carrying the burden in those areas, admittedly with Member States' money, they are not having to do as much there as they would presumably have to do for political reasons, and therefore the figures sometimes flatter them at our expense."
"That is part of the price we pay for having an external actions budget which has development assistance at its core but has other priorities as well."
"Could the Commissioner tell me if what he said adds up to a guarantee that there will be a better balance between commitments and payments in Asia and Latin America and that we will have better utilisation of the funds voted for in the budget?"
"I could also - if I was not as cautious a man as I am - point to progress already in increasing the percentage of payments in relation to commitments."
"The figure last year in the Mediterranean was 56% to 57%, much higher than any figure we have achieved before but lower than I want to see."
"If you look at the achievements of Europe Aid - all of whose staff I addressed yesterday - they are starting to be able to demonstrate an improvement in relation to commitments."
"They have demonstrated a considerable success in reducing dormant commitments and sleeping commitments so that the reste à liquider has fallen quite substantially."
"So we are making progress."
"It will take some time before we achieve the sort of figures that all of us want to see, but we are headed in the right direction."
"I very much hope that before I make my swan-song in this packed Hemicycle I will be able to point to even greater achievements by the excellent staff in Europe Aid."
"We are going to put the last question to the Commissioner."
"Question No 56 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0007/02):"
"Subject: International Criminal Court"
"For several years now the establishment of the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity has been a priority of EU foreign policy."
"Only recently, the EU, through the Belgian Presidency, reaffirmed its commitment to working to secure, as rapidly as possible, the 60 ratifications required for the Criminal Court to be brought into operation."
"To date, 48 countries have already ratified the Rome Statute, including all the EU Member States apart from Portugal (which has, however, already completed the relevant domestic procedures), Greece and Ireland."
"Three candidate countries - Poland, Hungary and Slovenia - have already ratified the Statute and Estonia has announced that it will shortly deposit its instruments of ratification."
"Given the fundamental importance which the EU attaches to the speedy introduction of this first stage of an international justice system and in view of the tragic events which have occurred around the world over the last few months and years, would the Commission not agree that the ratification of the Rome Statute should be explicitly established as forming part of the 'acquis communautaire' and as a new 'Copenhagen criterion' to be met by any future candidate for accession to the EU?"
"Does the Commission agree that ratification should serve as a precondition for the signing and ratification of any association or cooperation agreement between the Union and third countries?"
"First of all I would like to apologise to the honourable Member for not being present earlier to hear his, I am sure, eloquent - though I am not sure, supportive - speech in the excellent debate on the Middle East."
"He knows that was not meant as a discourtesy, it was for democratic reasons upstairs."
"I am sure we will be able to lock horns about some of those extremely important issues on other occasions."
"As for his question, the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"The adoption of the common position of 11 June 2001, which aims to promote early ratification of the Statute and the swift establishment of the ICC, and the ratification of the Statute by 13 Member States underline our commitment to this objective."
"Ratification preparations by the remaining two Member States are at an advanced stage."
"The European Union's commitment to this issue is also reflected in the level of Community funding given to NGOs working for ratification."
"Since 1995, this has reached almost EUR 7m under the European initiative for democratisation and human rights."
"With respect to the enlargement process, the European Union position on support to the ICC is part of the common foreign and security policy acquis, which candidates are asked to subscribe to."
"In addition, in line with the common position, the European Union regularly raises the question of ratification in the framework of political dialogues with accession countries."
"Moreover, the Central and Eastern European countries associated with the European Union and the associated countries Cyprus and Malta aligned themselves with the EU declaration at the Sixth Committee of the UN General Assembly in November 2001, which sought to encourage a swift start to the ICC."
"In January 2002, they also declared that they shared the objectives of the EU common position on the International Criminal Court and undertook to ensure that their national policies conform to that common position."
"The Council of Europe has also called on all its members to ratify or adhere to the ICC's Statute as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I too have no desire to go into the ins and outs of the matter, which was on this afternoon' s agenda."
"I simply wish to say to Commissioner Patten that I knew he had informed us that he would miss some of the debate."
"I am, therefore, very sorry, as I said a short while ago in plenary, that he was not able to join us."
"Having said that, politically, we are at odds on the matter, but I believe we will have the opportunity to discuss this again later."
"With regard to his answer to this specific question, I am quite satisfied with the Commission' s position."
"I would say that making this issue, as Commissioner Patten said, part of the acquis communautaire is a crucial point and this will certainly help the candidate countries to speed up their ratification procedures."
"I certainly do not want to detract from the acquis which the Member concerned and I have discovered together, but I would only add my wish that some of our other partners in international affairs were also committed to establishing the international criminal court."
"It continues to be an issue that we raise with our transatlantic friends with considerable vigour."
"We did so with the last administration and we are doing so with this one."
"It is not a question of the administration having changed its policy."
"I would have thought that recent events - including those related to Afghanistan - would have bolstered the case for an international criminal court."
"Maybe it will take a little longer for that message to get home."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 57 to 83 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"VAT - Direct and indirect taxation"
"The next item is the report (A5-0466/2001) by Mrs Kauppi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs,"
"1. on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax (COM(2001) 294 - C5-0269/2001 - 2001/0133(COD)) and"
"2. on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct and indirect taxation (COM(2001) 294 - C5-0270/2001 - 2001/0134(COD))"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, VAT fraud is a widespread problem in the European Union, which is unfortunately becoming more common all the time."
"According to reliable estimates, during the first half of 1998, for example, Member States detected 250 cases of so-called Carousel fraud, worth more than 500 million euros in all."
"To this must of course be added other types of fraud, and all the fraudulent transactions that remained undetected."
"We can therefore estimate that VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States hundreds of millions of euros every year."
"Generally it is a matter of Carousel Fraud."
"Carousel Fraud means the acquisition of goods without paying the VAT as required under the rules of the internal market."
"It is characterised by a chain of invoices, with or without goods, extending across one or more borders."
"The essential feature of this type of fraud is that one or more links in the chain do not pay invoiced VAT to the tax authority, while other parties in the chain receive VAT refunds based on these very invoices."
"Carousel Fraud generally concerns small items of value, such as computers and mobile phones."
"The most effective way of preventing this type of fraud is through close, administrative cooperation between the Member States."
"It is generally known, however, that the current legal framework is not up to the task."
"In order to streamline the current legislative framework, the Commission has now put forward a proposal for a regulation that would considerably enhance and improve current forms of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT."
"I also support the Commission' s proposal for a directive, in addition to which I propose measures in my report to make direct cooperation between the authorities still more effective and practical."
"The main point of the proposal is to allow for direct contact between local and regional authorities responsible for the fight against fraud."
"At present, all communication must go through central liaison offices, meaning that all requests pass through one country' s administrative machinery from a local office to a national liaison office and down the same path in the other country. This means that requests for assistance often arrive too late at their proper destination."
"The tax evaders may well have disappeared by the time the local officials in the country that received the request for help look into the matter."
"I agree with the Commission that cooperation at local level would improve mutual understanding regarding requests for information, would increase the motivation of tax inspectors, and would avoid wasting the few resources that exist."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission proposal, which should be seen as a major step forward in the fight against fraud."
"All too often, criminals can take immediate advantage of the most up-to-date and advanced means of communication, while the authorities are weighed down by bureaucratic, cumbersome rules, which slows down the work involved in tracking down the criminals and uses up far too many of the administration' s resources."
"The Commission, however, could have gone still further to speed up cooperation and increase flexibility."
"I support the Commission' s proposal for sending communications in electronic form wherever possible."
"I would also propose that, to speed up the flow of information, electronic communication should be made the rule, and traditional correspondence on paper the exception."
"For the same reason, to speed up the exchange of information, that is, more room for manoeuvre should be given to the local authorities with regard to language policy."
"The obligation to translate requests for assistance between authorities must be made more flexible."
"Why should it be a requirement to translate a request for assistance into the official language of the second country if, for example, a Finn and a Greek come to an understanding that they will deal with one another in French?"
"There is one point, however, where the Commission proposal goes too far. The Commission is proposing that the Member States would be under an obligation to restrict many of the rights contained in the Data Protection directive if they thought this necessary in order to safeguard important economic or financial interests."
"It should be noted that there is no such obligation contained in the said directive but that it is simply a possibility that Member States can resort to."
"This aspect of the matter would therefore be better addressed by an amendment to the Data Protection directive and at this stage it should be left to the Member States to consider whether or not to pursue this line of action."
"Finally, something should be said about the legal basis."
"The Commission bases its proposal on Article 95 of the Treaty, which means the co-decision procedure for Parliament."
"I agree with the Commission' s view that this proposal should concern administrative cooperation only and must be dealt with according to the procedure laid down in Article 95."
"The Council has always rejected this view, formerly, and changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94, which only require Parliament to be consulted."
"Now, however, the Commission has decided to take the Council to the European Court of Justice over another proposal for a directive concerning the recovery of claims."
"The legal situation will thus be cleared up soon."
"I would also like to hear comments from the Commissioner in connection with this choice of legal basis and any new information he might have for Parliament regarding how the case regarding the legal basis for the proposal for a directive on the recovery of claims is proceeding in the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Kauppi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my colleague Mrs Piia-Noora Kauppi, for this report, which met with very broad support in the competent committee."
"That means that there was excellent communication between all the parties involved."
"The report constitutes yet further evidence of the competence for which our young colleague has, in a short time, acquired a reputation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as also for the industriousness shown by the quality of her work."
"Many thanks for that."
"The report is, secondly, evidence of our need, in many instances, for 'more of Europe' ."
"It is only together that we can combat fraud more efficiently and thus more successfully."
"In this connection, we need, on the one hand, better coordination in order to move towards cooperation and exchange of information, and, on the other hand, an improved and more professional legal framework to facilitate this process of information and coordination more readily."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats says 'yes' to improved cooperation by the authorities against VAT fraud, although we of course emphasise that we are not only opposed to VAT fraud but also every form of fraud."
"In any case, 250 instances of it were uncovered in the first half of 1998, with losses amounting to over EUR 500 million."
"I can do no other than associate myself with the rapporteur in saying that we do not need obligatory translations in cross-border requests for information, but rather more flexibility as regards the data protection directive, deregulation to make things simpler, rationalisation and flexibility to get the work processed more quickly, so that we can get on the fraudsters' trails and so create greater security in Europe."
"Madam President, I would like to express my total support for the rapporteur, Mrs Kauppi' s suggestion, and, consequently, for the Commission proposal, to which the Kauppi report gives its almost unreserved support."
"We Socialists also wholeheartedly support this Commission proposal."
"The proposal deals with two very important matters."
"The first is the issue of tax fraud in a specific area, that of VAT in intra Community and triangular operations."
"The second issue, which is related to the first, as an instrument in combating fraud - is that of cooperation between public authorities to find a solution to, or at least, to reduce, the level of fraud previously mentioned."
"Mrs Kauppi gave a perfect explanation of the proposals in her speech and I fully share her sentiments."
"Having said this, I would like to make two additional comments with regard to the content of this report."
"The first refers to the validity, today, of the 'provisional VAT system' , a system which was implemented in 1993 on the completion of the single market, of a strictly provisional nature, even with an expiry date, that has been spun out and which has not been respected, as you are all well aware."
"I would like to draw your attention to this because the reason we are having to discuss this report and the fraud it deals with today is that, to a large extent, we continue to maintain this provisional VAT system - set up by intra Community operations - which places a burden on a series of operations in the country of destination without having those border controls that were maintained by the system in place before the entry into force of the single market."
"Clearly, in a definitive VAT system, which is appropriate to the single market, with taxation at source, we would probably not be discussing this issue, because much of this fraud would be prevented at source."
"This is the first observation that I would like to make with regard to this report."
"My second observation concerns a very important point, which Mrs Kauppi referred to: the legal base chosen by the Commission to present this proposal for a directive."
"In my opinion, the Commission' s interpretation of the Treaty has to be applauded, for considering that the base applicable in this case was Article 95, that is to say, for deciding that tax matters can be reduced to matters of substantial, substantive tax law, but not to those of adjective law, to those matters - such as those we are dealing with at the moment - that deal with the management of taxes and the exchange of information between public institutions in the management of taxes."
"In these cases, it is not really a matter of fiscal law or tax law itself, in the strict sense of the word, reserved for national parliaments and, as a consequence, for unanimity, but of an issue that can be dealt with, as is happening now, by the codecision procedure."
"I would like to conclude, Madam President, with a piece of advice that stems from my last comment; it would be a good idea if, in the next Convention and reform of the Treaty, the field of tax matters could be defined once and for all and that a precise framework for harmonisation can be established."
"Naturally, not all tax matters can be harmonised; there are certain areas, such as income tax, that will never be completely harmonised, but there are others - and here I am essentially thinking about the basis for calculating tax on company profits - which should be set up as something that can be harmonised and exempted from the unanimity rule, which would give Parliament the leading role in areas as important as those we are dealing with."
"Madam President, the EU is continuing to be taken for a ride by professional fraudsters, a situation which is, regrettably, a beneficiary of the excessively complex VAT system."
"It is through our tax regulations, which are in part difficult to understand, that we are laying ourselves open to fraudsters and indirectly promoting tax fraud."
"What we need in order to raise the level of taxpayer honesty and increase tax revenue is not only efficient monitoring and effective cooperation by the tax authorities, but also comprehensible and simpler legal texts as a fundamental precondition for this."
"The taxpayer very often refuses to pay taxes he regards as unfair."
"Incomprehensible tax laws and the tax burdens arising from them are, though, always or automatically seen by the taxpayer as unfair."
"We are therefore in urgent need of a reform of the VAT system, which is far too expensive and complex to the point of being incomprehensible even by experts."
"It is not acceptable for transactions to be tax-exempt within the business chain between the Member States but taxable at national level."
"It is advance deduction of tax within the business chain that facilitates this evasion of tax in the first place and that should therefore be abolished."
"By taking this step, we would be cutting the ground from under the fraudsters' feet, simplifying the system and avoiding needless controls, with all their vexations, which are a further burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We should, therefore, be thinking, first of all, not only in terms of how we get the different authorities to work together better, but also about how we can simplify the system that makes fraud possible in the first place."
"That would be a step in the right direction, but we will, nonetheless, support Mrs Kauppi's report, as we share her view that it is self-evident that cooperation should be improved and that the effort must be made to make Europe less bureaucratic."
"Madam President, I have no doubt that the existing arrangements for cooperation in the area of VAT fraud are inadequate in the context of the evolved single market."
"VAT fraud costs the EU and its Member States several hundred million euro each year."
"Although measures have been taken over the last few years to come to terms with it, VAT fraud is still a considerable problem today."
"I agree that the best way to tackle this ever-increasing fraud is to have close administrative cooperation between Member States."
"By allowing direct contacts between local offices, the fight against fraud will become less bureaucratic and more effective."
"However, let me sound a note of caution in relation to the efforts inherent in this Commission proposal to base this measure on Article 95 of the Treaty."
"Article 95 specifically states that it may not be used for fiscal provisions."
"The Commission's view is that this proposal is merely about administrative cooperation and that it does not relate to actual tax collection or tax measures."
"With respect, I do not agree - my country does not agree - that by stealth the present position should be eroded."
"I do not think that SCAC - the existing administrative committee in the tax area - should have more of these functions assigned to it."
"It is the thin end of the wedge."
"This proposal relates to fiscal instruments which Member States use and it should certainly be adopted, but it should be adopted with the correct legal basis, which is Article 93, providing for unanimity of voting at Council level."
"The regulation that this proposal aims to replace is based upon Article 93, and quite simply this proposal should be also."
"Mrs Kauppi has referred to the concerns regarding the legal basis in her attached explanatory memorandum."
"In the past where conflicts have arisen in relation to the legal basis, the Council has always rejected the Commission's view and has changed the legal basis to Article 93 or 94."
"As pointed out by my colleague, it did this most recently on the proposal for a directive on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims."
"The Commission has decided to take the Council to the Court of Justice in this matter and Ireland will be joining the action on the side of the Council."
"While I welcome the substance of what this proposal aims to do, for the reasons I have outlined in relation to the legal basis, I and my Irish colleagues will be voting against the report."
"Madam President, they say that 'noblesse oblige' and I should, therefore, start my speech by congratulating Commissioner Bolkestein, on the skill with which he was able, this morning, to resolve the conflict that Parliament, the Council and the Commission have been facing for such a long time, preventing us from progressing towards a single market in financial services."
"I would also like to congratulate Mrs Kauppi on her report, which has managed, as has already been said, to achieve the support of most of the political groups in this House."
"I would like to make just a few specific observations."
"In a recent appearance to prepare for the monetary dialogue with Wim Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank, we were given a report which demonstrated that the introduction of the euro will make price differences between the various countries in Europe more evident, as a result, amongst other things, of differences in taxation."
"This leads us to call for the harmonisation of VAT and for it to be applied at source, as Mr Pérez Royo suggested, but, until this happens, it is clear that these price differences will encourage fraud."
"For this reason, 'more Europe' , or more decentralised cooperation within the European Union, is always welcome."
"I was a tax inspector and I know how the obligation to refer to higher public authorities can paralyse an idea."
"We need to eliminate formal requirements."
"I see no need for a translation: nobody would ask for a translation of information that would permit the arrest of Jack the Ripper and I do not see why things should be different in the field of taxation."
"With regard to the legal base, I disagree with the last speaker but I agree with Mr Pérez Royo, given that the difference between substantive law, which characterises the essential elements of the tax system, and formal law, which was set up in order to guarantee that these obligations are met, is well known."
"Whereas the rules of substantive law have their base in Article 93 and, therefore, unanimity, those concerning formal law, administrative law and application law have their base in Article 95 because, amongst other things, this allows us to avoid unanimity and also paves the way, as we saw this morning in the field of financial services, for what the Spanish Presidency calls 'more Europe' ."
"May I begin by saying that it gives me a great deal of pleasure to be able to discuss with Parliament today a proposal for a regulation to strengthen administrative cooperation between Member States in order to enhance VAT control."
"I thank Mrs Kauppi very much for her report."
"It is extremely constructive."
"I can only echo what was said by Mr Karas who referred to Mrs Kauppi as his ""young and effective colleague""."
"She is not my colleague but I should like to echo the appreciative words of Mr Karas."
"Mrs Kauppi, along with other Members of Parliament, spoke about the legal basis of this proposal."
"It is about administrative cooperation."
"It is not about changing the VAT regime."
"I wish the Commission could do that."
"We have wanted to do so for many years but we are not able to do so."
"But no, it is about administrative cooperation."
"It is not designed to change in any way the obligations of taxpayers or the rules governing the application of that legislation, but rather to gear administrative cooperation to the challenges of the internal market."
"That is why the Commission is submitting this proposal under Article 95 of the Treaty."
"In taking that article as the legal basis the Commission is consistent with its proposal for Regulation No 218/92 as well as with its proposal to modify the recovery directive."
"The Commission is correct in choosing Article 95 as the basis of this proposal."
"As Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said quite clearly, it gives Parliament codecision and that is what many Members of this Parliament want."
"I take this opportunity to thank Mr García-Margallo y Marfil for the kind words he uttered in my direction."
"I add to that that the Commission is extremely pleased that we have settled the matter of the so-called Lamfalussy proposal and that we can now continue with the work ahead."
"More to the point, the Commission is of the opinion that this proposal is an important element of the new VAT strategy to improve the operation of the VAT system within the context of the internal market."
"It also constitutes a response to the Council calling on the Commission to present proposals for fighting VAT fraud."
"The intra-Community market is today seriously affected by organised VAT fraud, where professional fraudsters abuse the exemption mechanism of the VAT system."
"Tackling that kind of fraud requires rapid and efficient cooperation between the tax administrations of the different Member States."
"But at present the legal framework is too weak to support really effective cooperation, essentially because it is vague, over-centralised and the exchange of information is not sufficiently intensive."
"In addition, cooperation is complicated owing to the existence of two legal instruments in this area with different scopes and different rules."
"This proposal sets up one single legal framework merging, for VAT purposes, the regulation and the directive, and modifies the current arrangements in three ways: firstly, the proposal lays down clear and binding rules governing administrative cooperation between Member States, for example, for the presence of foreign officials during controls, or for organising multilateral controls; secondly, the proposal devolves cooperation and provides for more direct contacts between tax inspectors of different Member States."
"This is also a point which Mrs Kauppi drew to our attention."
"She said that when French and Spanish controllers - for example - in a border area want to communicate, at the moment this communication has to pass via Madrid and Paris."
"It is obvious that direct communication between inspection staff will make cooperation faster and more effective."
"Thirdly, the proposal aims to intensify the exchange of information between tax administrations in order to combat fraud more effectively."
"I am very pleased that this proposal gets the support of all speakers this evening, except for Mrs Doyle, whom I can no longer convince, since she is no longer here."
"The Commission is extremely pleased with this support."
"I would therefore like to particularly welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur, Mrs. Kauppi."
"But given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council, and given the Commission' s strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board, as much as possible, during the negotiations in the Council."
"However I fear it will not be possible to take some of these amendments fully into account."
"In particular, as regards the issue of electronic communication, I would like to stress that much of the information covered by this regulation is not available in electronic format, and therefore, in practice, cannot be exchanged by electronic means."
"As regards the translations, I share the argument according to which Member States should strive as far as possible to waive a translation."
"But the Commission takes the view that the arrangements under which Member States should waive translations should be determined in an implementing regulation, binding for all Member States, and not individually by each Member State."
"Finally, as concerns data protection, the Commission takes the view that if Directive 95/46/EC is fully applied, fraudsters would be informed that they are under suspicion, and consequently it is to be expected that they would transfer their fraudulent activity and would dispose of the evidence of fraud."
"That would seriously hamper the fight against VAT fraud."
"I am personally confident that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues."
"The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail."
"It will do its best to achieve an agreement as soon as possible, and we are making good headway."
"But your support of the proposal is important to achieve that much desired result."
"I would therefore recommend this proposal most warmly for Parliament's approval."
"I thank Parliament for its most constructive intervention."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"State aid"
"The next item is the report (A5-0002/2002) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission' s ninth survey on state aid in the European Union (COM(2001) 403 - C5-0632/2001 - 2001/2269(COS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, today the world's eyes - or let us rather say, the eyes of Europe - were again upon you and what you were doing, although you were dealing with matters different from those which we are dealing with here tonight, which do not appear to be that interesting."
"However, I have just heard that I am permitted to speak for eight minutes, as my group is not especially interested in the subject."
"I see, though, that Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen are here, and so we can, anyway, give a repeat of our performance in committee, swapping our positions on this issue."
"But, joking aside ..."
"We have jointly - and ambitiously - resolved that the European Union is to become the world's most competitive region within the next ten years."
"If the European Union wants to be the world's most competitive region, that means that its enterprises must be the most competitive enterprises in the world."
"It also means that we need the European Union's ambience to be both favourable to competition and capable of handling it."
"Thus far, it is right that our task should be to roll back state aid to enterprises as far as possible, and our task must also be - if we actually have to grant aid at all - to direct it increasingly towards horizontal goals."
"To that extent, the perceptible decline in aid between 1997 and 1999 is to be welcomed - and that is the period under consideration, the period covered by the Commission's ninth aid report."
"We still, of course, call on the Commission to perform its role as a guard against aid that distorts competition."
"On the other hand, we should desist from seeing aid policy only through lenses coloured by ideology, and from engaging in it from one ideological standpoint or another."
"Some of us do that from time to time in this House, and I will give an example of it later."
"Whether we like it or not, it is a matter of fact that aid is a tool of state policy, because it is used for incentives to facilitate control in line with the market and because it can be used to avoid the need for intervention in the form of instructions or prohibitions."
"That cannot always be done."
"It is sometimes more appropriate to achieve something by means of legal regulations, but also sometimes just as practical to do it by means of control in line with the market."
"Aid has a vital place among the political instruments, as it can be used to correct failings in the market and reduce differences in standards of living between regions of the European Union."
"What we are doing with European regional and structural policy is, indeed, also aid, albeit not of the State variety that we want to discuss this evening, and those policies are political instruments in supporting SMEs, environmental protection, research and development."
"Let me say, Commissioner, that I welcome the fact that you, or the Commission, now have, in addition to the register of aid systems, which has now come into being, the State Aid Scoreboard."
"That was something called for by all groups in Parliament."
"This State Aid Scoreboard, which is in its earliest stages, can, in my view, be developed into an instrument which will make it possible to discern trends and assess aid by reference to qualitative criteria - the qualitative criteria to which I have just referred."
"That, then, is something I value."
"It is not only the quantity of state aid that should be comprehensively assessed; we also need qualitative criteria and objectives that have to be taken equally into account."
"As I have said, I have named them."
"Sometimes they justify control measures with time limits, and even existing market distortions can be removed in the medium term by the use of aid."
"I believe that the Commission has a far more broad and open mind - with apologies to Mr Evans, and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen - than has the present conservative-liberal majority in this House."
"I have noted that, in general debates, there is always full-bodied rejection of aid as if it were quite simply a snare of the devil."
"The politicians in the field, should one ask them, take quite different views of certain points."
"In reality, they too want nothing to do with its general disparagement."
"Let me now give you the example I mentioned earlier."
"The Commission has, fortunately, been investigating for some time the extent to which sleights-of-hand in the taxation of businesses are being used to obtain illicit aid."
"The Commission is doing this on its own initiative and because it is right to do so, but it is also doing it because it was called upon to do it."
"In committee, I formulated a passage in my draft report which the Commission, remarkably, emphatically supports, and along the lines of which it intends to go forward."
"When a vote was taken, the majority in committee cut out this passage."
"Now, I will be giving you the opportunity to make good this error tomorrow."
"My group will be reinserting this passage, and a couple of others as well, by means of an amendment."
"Do please remember that this is common policy on which we have agreed."
"So, tomorrow, you can make good the committee's error, or, alternatively, make it clear in public that that is not how you see the details of aid policy."
"You will have to do some thinking about that."
"I want to wind up by saying that too much praise for the Commission is not such a good thing."
"Let us cut back on it a little."
"So I would like to refer, Commissioner, to something I touched on once or twice in committee."
"It also has to do with the subject of qualitative criteria, qualitative and quantitative assessment."
"That is the area, as you will rightly observe, of regional aid granted by the Member States, which makes up a very large part of the aid total, well above half, I think about 56% or more if I remember rightly."
"You will conclude that that is the area in which a reduction in aid can be best and most rapidly achieved."
"That is, though, rather a generalised way of looking at things, and I would again recommend that you think a bit about whether it is not perhaps the area of regional aid in which we have very definitely to be guided by qualitative criteria."
"If we were to have a debate on that next year, that would represent some small progress."
"Madam President, I should like to challenge some of the assertions that have been made by Mr Rapkay."
"Firstly, there is very much more that unites us on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs than you would think from some of the assertions he has just made."
"We can see that from the report that we are considering."
"There are 22 paragraphs in this report."
"Mr Rapkay had only six areas where his report was significantly amended."
"We have six amendments to consider tomorrow."
"Let us look at the things that unite us."
"I certainly do not believe that state aid is the work of the devil."
"In a sense that was excessive rhetoric on the part of Mr Rapkay."
"We actually both believe in a competitive Europe."
"We are in favour of making our economy competition-friendly."
"Mr Rapkay's excellent report - which I will support in its current form tomorrow - is a consistent report building on the one produced by the committee last year."
"Of course there will be some differences of emphasis between us."
"We do not all share the same political outlook."
"But there is a trend in relation to the views that have been forward by the Economic Committee which are at the core of Mr Rapkay's report and for which I congratulate him."
"Yes, I certainly believe in the rigorous application of state aid."
"I congratulate Commissioner Monti for the stance that he has taken in this area."
"It is something that broadly reflects the position of our Economic Committee."
"Our committee is committed to taking forward the Lisbon process."
"Building a competitive Europe must be a part of that, so it is important that we have proper state aid control."
"Part of that is through the transparency that comes from the State Aid Scoreboard, of which Mr Rapkay has been a keen exponent."
"He has raised the issue consistently."
"We are delighted that Commissioner Monti has made progress in this area."
"There is more work to be done in developing the scoreboard."
"I am not absolutely sure that the Competition DG competition is at the front of the queue in terms of the Internet-friendly nature of its particular website."
"I am absolutely confident that more progress will be made."
"I went on to the Internet the other day to find out about the Competition Day that is coming up."
"It was not a particularly friendly site to deal with."
"I should like to mention the Steel Aid Code."
"I have consistently said to Commissioner Monti that the industry is looking for guidance here."
"We want the current regime to stay in place in some format."
"I hope that Commissioner Monti will feel after mature reflection that, given the difficulties with the United States of America, that is something he could support."
"Madam President, as Mr Rapkay said, we can talk to each other as we are used to doing now that we are gathered 'in the bosom of our family' ."
"I would first of all say thank you again to Mr Monti for the great efforts he has made in this area, and I would also thank Mr Rapkay very much."
"We do not always agree, but I am very pleased with the report, even if there are a number of things we have to discuss regarding how we are to vote tomorrow."
"There are also a couple of practical matters I should like to comment on, first of all a matter on which I myself have done some work, namely the Commission' s proposal concerning the shipyards package."
"We had a debate on this here in Parliament last autumn."
"I was very much against the proposed aid to shipyards, and I therefore want to ask the Commission how this matter is progressing."
"I was delighted to note that, at the Council meeting of Trade and Industry Ministers at the beginning of December, it was impossible to obtain the necessary majority for adopting the Commission' s proposal."
"The Commission was not immediately willing to alter its proposal, which was based upon the results worked out in what is known as the TBR report, drawn up by the Commission every six months."
"Naturally, I am concerned that the Commission' s next TBR report will conveniently demonstrate that we need aid for more types of ship than those cited in the Commission' s original proposal."
"I would therefore ask Commissioner Monti to answer the following question: is there a new TBR report on the way from the Commission and, if so, can the Commissioner then inform us as to what conclusions are to be drawn by it?"
"Tomorrow, we in Parliament will vote on a proposal we did not have time to discuss before the vote."
"It is most certainly a proposal that does not fall within your area, Mr Monti, for it concerns the fact that, quite extraordinarily, the airlines have been allowed to retain airport arrival and departure times which, under normal rules, they have made too little use of to be permitted to retain."
"We are, then, preparing special legislation which we are now rushing through and which will, of course, mean that smaller airlines that wish to enter the market with competitive prices will not be allowed to offer this service to us as consumers, who shall instead have to put up with airlines which do not deliver the goods and which - when they do deliver them - only do so at unduly high prices."
"That is also the reality where state aid is concerned, for it largely favours the old national companies with their monopolies."
"For me, that is an example of the way in which our fine words about cutting back on state aid are all too infrequently followed up by firm and practical action."
"I would therefore also permit myself to ask you a question, Mr Monti. How does this proposal fit in with our general desire to cut back on state aid and create a situation in which we can all compete fairly and on an equal basis?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I have no hesitation in adding to those words of thanks that have gone to Commissioner Monti and Mr Rapkay, as rapporteur."
"State aid granted on a large scale, often for shortsighted reasons, has for a long time been a strain on the purse of the European taxpayer and has slowed down the reorganisation of the economic structures of our Member States."
"Although aid granted by Member States might be justified in particularly exceptional circumstances, large amounts of aid and various tax concessions distort competition and go against the principles of the single market."
"For that reason, reductions in state aid and effective monitoring strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy and thus boost economic growth and the creation of jobs."
"At the Stockholm European Council the Member States renewed their commitment to reduce state aid as a proportion of GNP."
"There was also a promise to redirect state aid to horizontal objectives that benefited the Union as a whole."
"This commitment must be kept to."
"According to the general survey we are now dealing with, a decline in state aid was achieved in the period 1997 - 1999."
"We cannot, however, be satisfied with the progress made up to the present day."
"We in Parliament have time and time again called for action that would guarantee greater transparency in this area."
"The Member States still do not have any monitoring instrument that can be compared to the state agency monitoring that is conducted at Community level."
"Data on state aid is still provided only in the form of total sums."
"To make an accurate analysis possible we need more detailed information on the use aid is put to and the sectors and companies that receive aid."
"Like many of my colleagues before me, I also take a very positive view of the Commission' s announcement that a state aid register and scoreboard is to be introduced."
"I also urge the Commission to continue with its earlier policy of reorganising the Union' s economic and production structures, especially with regard to sector- and case-specific state aid."
"In this respect I agree fully with what my colleague, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, said about the shipbuilding industry, which is also a major sector from the point of view of Finland, my country."
"There has been good progress made recently in that area by the Council."
"If Europe is to become the world' s most competitive economic area, it will mean giving up the practices of old."
"It is clear, however, that new and permanent jobs will not be created by trying to maintain dilapidated structures."
"Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, particularly Mr Rapkay, who has tabled this excellent motion for a resolution."
"I greatly welcome the support pledged by the committee with this report for a rigorous state aid control policy."
"Listening to this brief but interesting debate, I believe I can see a wide consensus, as, moreover, has been pointed out, between the different parties represented in Parliament."
"I believe I can also see a non-ideological approach, and I feel that the more we succeed in producing information tools, the more we will be able to move away from reasoning solely in terms of ideologies and place ourselves in a position to assess the qualitative as well as the quantitative aspects of state aid."
"I welcome the fact that the committee calls on Member States to live up to the commitment they entered into at the Stockholm European Council, which Mrs Kauppi has just mentioned, to reduce state aid as a proportion of GDP."
"Despite the positive developments of recent years, I too feel that there is still room for further reduction of state aid in the Member States."
"I essentially agree that a careful reassessment of the relationship between regional policy and competition policy must be carried out for the period after 2006."
"I also share the concern expressed in the motion for a resolution regarding returning regional policy to national control, given that some of the economically stronger Member States are arguing that a reduction in Structural Funds expenditure should be offset by greater tolerance with regard to national aid."
"I see this as an extremely worrying trend."
"I am very pleased with the positive reaction of the committee and the Rapkay report to two instruments which might not yet be as user-friendly as we would like."
"For our part, we will endeavour to constantly improve the State Aid Scoreboard and the state aid register now available on the Internet."
"There is no longer any need for me to describe these two instruments - you are quite familiar with them - and from now on the scoreboard, in particular, will make it possible to share useful information through Internet connections with the Member States and, with the introduction of the second edition, with the European Parliament as well."
"What is more, the state aid register supplements the scoreboard, providing more detailed information in a less aggregate form on each case of aid, specifying the sectors and businesses concerned."
"Concerning the steel industry, may I remind Parliament that the Commission has already expressed its intention that strict rules on state aids to this sector be maintained after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty."
"The European Parliament, Member States, the ECSC Consultative Committee, as well as steel companies and their associations, have also requested strict rules for state aids to the steel industry."
"The Commission considers that this objective may be attained by focusing on the types of state aid that, from the experience of the past and taking into account the features of the steel industry, have most distortive effects on competition in this sector."
"This is the case of investment aid and rescue and restructuring aid."
"It is the Commission's intention to continue the current prohibition of these types of aid after the expiry of the Treaty on 23 July 2002 and this point is planned for discussion in the Commission very soon."
"Mrs Riis-Jørgensen mentioned shipbuilding, and your interest in this does not surprise me entirely."
"You are well aware what the conclusions or the non-conclusions were in the Industry Council in December."
"Indeed, a report is being produced concerning the situation of another market segment, for which a procedure has been started."
"I have nothing new to report on this."
"On airlines, I would just like to point out that the Commission has decided, concerning the events of 11 September, that indeed they were of an exceptional nature in the sense of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty."
"This means that state aid to make good damage caused can be accepted - though as you know, this has been applied by the Commission in a very stringent and cautious and restrictive manner - concerning the four days following 11 September, as a result of the closure of US air space, and measures to cover the excess costs of insurance in air transport for one month or if needed to the end of the year."
"Finally, let me once again stress how grateful the Commission is for the interest of Parliament in the state aid policy."
"This encourages us to act more and more effectively in this delicate and important area."
"Madam President, they could not fly for four days after 11 September and now they want to have a monopoly for more than a year."
"Everything can be blamed on 11 September."
"Please give us a free economy."
"I understand Mrs Riis-Jørgensen as saying ""they want""."
"So far as I am aware, this is not a Commission position or decision, even though my colleague Mrs de Palacio is the Commissioner responsible in this area."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Monitoring of BSE"
"The next item is the report (A5-0467/2001) by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the follow-up to the BSE crisis with regard to public health and food safety (2000/2321(INI))."
"Madam President, allow me to begin by thanking everyone who has helped with this report: MEPs from other political groups - especially Mrs Roth-Behrendt, former chairperson of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on BSE - together with the Commission and the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin."
"Globalisation increases with every day that passes."
"It is a good sign that we are trading more and more across borders."
"We need a free flow of goods within the European Union, as well as an ever freer flow of goods in the world."
"It is, however, important that this should not lead to our seeing a freer flow of viruses."
"Where mad cow disease is concerned, it feels as though the European Union has gone into the free market back to front."
"First of all, a free market was created, and then we began to investigate whether the rules were adequate for a free market."
"In recent years, a number of gratifying measures have been adopted."
"For example, we have created the European Food Authority."
"Moreover, food legislation has been reviewed, and this will lead to sound legislation once all the legal acts have entered into force."
"Experience so far is alarming, however."
"A look back shows that many Member States have been poor at complying with the legislation."
"It is, then, not only the defective legislation but also inadequate compliance with this that have resulted in the present position."
"It is extremely important that we now remedy this and become better at complying with the legislation."
"If we consider the connection between these different diseases, we can see that scrapie, which is the oldest TSE disease, was discovered as long as several hundred years ago, while BSE, which attacks bovines, was not discovered until 1986."
"We are obviously at a stage where a lot is happening."
"Life continues, and so does its negative sides."
"We must therefore be prepared for the possibility of constantly discovering new problems."
"During the autumn, there was some anxiety that BSE might also be able to attack sheep."
"That is presumably the background to Paragraph 11, about the need to monitor sheep, being included in the report."
"I believe that its inclusion is a mistake and call upon Members not to vote in favour of it, for it appears that the investigation which was to have been carried out on sheep' s brains was most likely carried out on cows' brains."
"Scientists too, of course, make mistakes from time to time."
"The problem with BSE is that it is a disease which crosses the species barrier."
"This means that there is a risk of people too being infected."
"We know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a major worry in this context."
"I want to point out some of the measures we propose for the future in the report."
"First of all, I want to state that, for ethical reasons, ruminants must obviously never be fed with meat meal."
"They are not carnivores by nature and nor, therefore, must they be forced to eat meat."
"It is, however, sensible - and we return to this in the second report - for primary produce that is suitable for human consumption also perhaps to be used as feed."
"The problem is that there is a risk of disease if an animal eats other animals of the same species."
"What is termed a cannibalism ban ought therefore to be introduced, prohibiting the feeding of animals with feed produced from animals of the same species."
"There is a considerable risk of infection, and there has been little in the way of compliance."
"We must therefore probably observe that it will not be possible within the foreseeable future to remove the ban on feeding omnivores with meat meal and bone meal."
"In the long term, when there is better compliance, it may perhaps be possible to do so."
"Regarding the important issue of sanctions, I want to put a direct question to Commissioner Byrne. If individual Member States do not meet their Treaty obligations, the EU must have powers to intervene by taking measures to guarantee food safety - an issue that we also address in a number of points in the report."
"We also believe that the Commission must be able to impose sanctions upon Member States that have not done enough to apply this type of legislation."
"It would be particularly interesting to hear the Commissioner' s view on this."
"Finally, I want to repeat what I actually stated at the beginning of my speech."
"Research is needed within both this and other adjacent areas if we are to be alert to new problems' and diseases' arising."
"Diseases of this kind are dangerous to both animals and human beings, and it is incredibly important that we in the EU devote adequate resources to maintaining the fight against them at a high level."
"Madam President, Commissioner Byrne, this being the fifteenth year since cases of the disease first appeared, one might think we had done everything necessary and had got a grip on BSE."
"When we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were drafting our opinion and yet again pointing out that all Member States should now be carrying out their checks properly, we did think that, well, that has to be re-emphasised."
"We could not have guessed that it would become such a live issue, yet we are now learning from Germany, mainly from Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate, that the tests were done carelessly and the checking handed over to private firms which were ill-suited to it."
"One can only scratch one's head in bafflement."
"One can, of course, tell the Commission to better exercise supervisory control, but one can scarcely demand that any more, as the people at the bottom know just as well what it is all about."
"Let us face it, BSE is a dangerous disease, and it is actually scandalous that tests are done only from the age of thirty months."
"Most of the animals that end up in the slaughter line have not been tested."
"Take Great Britain, where tests are still not being done at all, because animals over 30 months old are not permitted to enter the food chain, even though tests are, of course, necessary in order to establish the incidence of BSE among animals that are not getting into the food chain."
"When it comes to the scientists who made a laughing-stock of themselves by examining sheep whose brains then turned out to be those of cattle, we cannot of course say, 'OK, then there is no danger to sheep.'"
"There is a danger to sheep, so they too have to be tested."
"Turning to the circulation of animal bone meal, there are still evidently thousands of tonnes of infected or potentially infected animal bone meal making their way around the world, so that BSE is still spreading further afield and cropping up in places where we had never expected it."
"We see here, Commissioner Byrne, that the feed ban is evidently inadequate."
"It must be stated where the stuff has to go and how it is to be destroyed."
"As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has also made clear, the same applies to feeding with swill and food leftovers, which has, over and over again, brought us foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest when feed contained these in untreated form."
"This means that, here too, we can do nothing by means of a ban on its own, but must say where the stuff should go."
"If we had voted on the so-called interim report - 'The Handling of Animal By-products' - all of ten years ago, we would, of course, be under far less pressure from BSE, and if we had had it all along, there would have been no BSE."
"I would say the same about swill and food leftovers: if we had had proper handling of these food leftovers, there would have been no infection with foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest."
"We must reach the stage where one system prescribes this for all countries."
"Those who have an economic interest in bringing about the proper handling of animal by-products must be granted licences and punished by their withdrawal if they fail to do what the law prescribes."
"Whoever breaks this law must lose his livelihood, because human health in our country is at stake here."
"We must be bold in showing this rigour, or else - even in ten years' time - we will still be discussing the recurrence of lapses."
"Mr Byrne, I wish to expressly confirm to you that the Commission bears no responsibility for these latest failures."
"They are the responsibility of the Member States."
"The Commission has also done good work on the drafting of the interim report and on its presentation."
"Madam President, I shall try to be brief, but I should like to say to the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, that this report comes at a time when we have the impression that we have reached a standstill in the BSE crisis."
"The Member States have, on several occasions, shown how hard they are finding it to manage this crisis."
"The European Union must not, therefore, shirk its responsibilities in this matter, particularly with the prospect of the forthcoming enlargement."
"It is crucial, today, to better coordinate everyone' s efforts to put an end to this epidemic and to prevent further crises arising in the future."
"Our objective is food safety."
"We will only be able to achieve this objective by means of better coordination of the policies implemented in each State, and through greater harmonisation of screening procedures and of the fight against the disease."
"My group, however, is divided over the measures to be adopted in this field, although I personally fully support the report by Mr Olsson."
"On the whole, my colleagues fully support these measures, which must enable us to achieve the objective of food safety."
"The differences of opinion concern the approaches to be taken."
"This is something I regret, because this obligation to public health must not allow us to relax the rigour to which we have subscribed under the precautionary principle."
"The aim is not to pit farmers and environmentalists or farmers and health specialists against one another."
"Farmers want to produce and to be able to guarantee the quality of their products; environmentalists, like those responsible for public health, want to contribute to a sustainable development, but everyone' s objectives are, in fact, the same."
"Therefore, this obligation to public health does not allow any relaxation of rigour in terms of implementing the precautionary principle and the principle of zero tolerance, respecting the ban on feeding animals with animal meal, and the destruction of existing stocks of such meal."
"I can see that our British colleagues are having a hard time and that they would like to find alternatives to destroying the entire national herd, but none of this should allow us to relax the rigor that we want to see in this monitoring of the BSE crisis."
"I should like to conclude, Madam President, by reminding you that, in this field, it is crucial that the Commission is able to put a number of sanctions in place and that it ensures that the necessary inspections are made by the Food and Veterinary Office."
"Community legislation must be implemented more systematically and must be implemented in all the Member States in the same way."
"Sanctions must be followed up and we must be able to guarantee consumers the highest level of safety in order to restore the public' s confidence in their farmers and in their political leaders."
"Madam President, the Commissioner is in danger of hearing the same speech many times in different languages."
"This is the English version."
"I am speaking here on behalf of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, as her father died yesterday and she has had to return home."
"I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing sympathy to her."
"These are the things I want to say. First and foremost, we still do not know enough about BSE and about how it is spread."
"We certainly do not know enough about its incidence in all the Member States of the Community."
"We know that we still have it in the UK and although in the coming year it may be that other Member States have more cases than us, that is not a cause for satisfaction for us, but rather for commiseration with those who are still discovering the full horror of what this may mean for them."
"In the UK we have had over a hundred cases of the human form of CJD."
"We pray that other Member States will not go through that agony either."
"The Commissioner will be entitled to say to us, when we talk about inadequate testing, that the Commission has said time after time that the real truth about BSE was hidden because there was no effective testing."
"If this debate does one thing at least, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and others have said, it may impress upon us that the Member States need to be able to do this."
"I am glad that Mr Olsson accepts that there is an equality of effectiveness between the way the UK takes out animals at 30 months and the slaughter of affected herds and testing of individual animals before they enter the food chain in other European countries."
"I would not want to see any misunderstandings about that."
"I believe we need more effective checks for contamination."
"There are some late, worrying statistics in the UK and elsewhere about animals born after the checks were put into effect, which are still now showing symptoms of BSE."
"There are obvious suspicions about the hoarding of meat and bonemeal and about where and how the testing is effected."
"Mr Olsson wants the FBO to be in effect the monitoring agency."
"I do not mind that, but I believe that nothing should subtract from the responsibility of the individual Member States to ensure that their testing and external controls are effective and are carried through."
"Then there is the question of animal waste to herbivores."
"We will be debating this when Mrs Paulsen's report comes back for its chequered second reading."
"I would simply say that I am in that party in this House that believes, with Mr Olsson, that we should outlaw the feeding of animal waste of any form to ruminant animals."
"It is high time that was done."
"Finally, on the issue of sheep, I would just say to Mr Olsson that when we look at that lamentable failure over the testing of what turned out to be cows' brains, all that tells us is that there was incompetence of a grotesque kind. It does not tell us that we have proof positive that BSE has not jumped species once again and got into the sheep population."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on those things and I apologise for repeating some of the other excellent remarks made in this debate."
"Madam President, I welcome the report as it raises many important issues as we work towards a comprehensive and a safe food policy in the EU."
"Control of infectious diseases goes hand in hand with proper monitoring."
"Close consideration should be given to how infectious diseases are monitored by European Union institutions."
"We must likewise question the methods of countries outside the EU and impose stricter import controls like those carried out in Australia and New Zealand."
"However, we must remember, if regulations are drawn up, that it is important to impose penalties on Member States which fail to implement EU legislation on feed and foodstuffs, otherwise regulations are not worth the paper they are written on."
"I call on Members to let common sense prevail."
"Of course we need to test animals for BSE, but let us base the tests on sound scientific practices."
"There is no proof that testing animals at 24 months is foolproof."
"On the contrary, animals can develop BSE after 24 months."
"I have had no satisfactory answers as to what this calculation is based upon."
"The 30-month threshold currently imposed seems to be working."
"The forecasts are that the UK will be BSE-free by 2005, and this has been achieved using the 30-month threshold."
"Meat under 30 months can now be exported from the UK and it is true to say that it has proved to be a safe product for the consumer."
"Another concern is the compulsory testing of sheep."
"Again I urge caution and call again on sound scientific evidence."
"The whole UK flock was nearly wiped out last year because of the discovery of BSE in sheep."
"However, luckily someone questioned the validity of the findings and it was then discovered that the test was actually carried out on a cow's brain after all."
"This episode did little to restore farmers' confidence in proper scientific research."
"We need to develop a comprehensive animal health strategy and ask ourselves what we have learned from BSE."
"The main thing, without a doubt, is not to tamper with nature on ethical grounds."
"Herbivores must not be made to eat meat or fishmeal."
"However, we must now concentrate on the future and work on a policy and strategy to undo the damage to the food chain."
"Finally, the farming community has suffered a great blow over the past few years."
"Let us work together now towards a food safety policy and a reform of the common agricultural policy which moves us away from a so-called consumer-led policy that led to intensification - but let us not move either to a consumer-led policy based on unfounded theories."
"We must regain consumer confidence by producing a policy that will embrace all aspects."
"Madam President, infringements of the fundamental principles of food standards law provide a great deal of headline material in many, if not all, of the countries of the European Union."
"Although they involved a lot of distortion and scaremongering, reports played a significant role in preventing such occurrences from being forgotten."
"The breaches in the investigation of BSE which have become public knowledge in recent days represent setbacks for all those who have campaigned to introduce a high level of consumer health protection in food production, and I think they had had some of those already."
"It is precisely the great public interest in this subject, and the apparent avoidability of the most recent instances of human health being put in danger, that justifies the introduction of strict sanctions as asked for by the report, in order to finally stop new cases of BSE flaring up."
"The highest standards in food production should apply in the European Union."
"Such is the most significant statement in the White Paper on Food Safety."
"The legal framework this requires must, as I understand things, be allied to a recognised early warning system through the EU countries, so that suspicion that human health has been endangered will result in the products being designated and their manufacturers named in public."
"As a rule, public warnings are always desirable, above all when it is suspected that a product has been widely distributed, which is always the likely case in the never-ending cycle of food production."
"It makes sense to me that specific food producers should be publicly named and warned where, in future, there is the mere suspicion of danger through unhygienic production practices or basic materials."
"The widely-honoured principle is this: checks on animal feed are the preliminary stages of foodstuffs inspection."
"The report's demands are indeed far-reaching."
"Practical experience will show whether breach of a specific duty by the withholding of information should have the same consequence as fraud against the financial interest of the European Community."
"The whole importance of the report lies in the necessity of referring again and again to the need to abide by existing prohibitions and instructions."
"I wish to observe in conclusion that Mr Olsson's report is of contemporary relevance and shows close acquaintance with the present situation."
"I do not believe that it is a plan of campaign for the next BSE crisis."
"Madam President, BSE crystallises the fears and the doubts of both consumers and producers: a considerable fall in the consumption of beef and a more than 20% fall in the price of produce."
"Europe, which is largely responsible for this tragic health crisis, must learn the lessons from it, particularly with regard to the failings that have occurred."
"Instead of giving the Commission and the Veterinary Office greater powers, it would be better to harmonise the measures that need to be taken and then implement them effectively."
"How, for example, is it possible that the list of specific risk material varies from one State to another?"
"The European Union, the largest consumer of agricultural produce, must impose its requirements for food safety on extra-Community policy. In other words, it must apply to imports similar rules to those that regulate European production."
"With regard to research policy, all means must be harnessed: research into the disease, methods of transmission, means of prevention, the updating of tests on living animals, etc."
"With regard to waste treatment, how is animal meal stored?"
"How is it going to be processed?"
"This crisis also has a major economic and social aspect, with the threat to entire swathes of the farming sector."
"The fall in the number of farms clearly illustrates the professional crisis affecting young farmers."
"How, indeed, can they contemplate the future with ease if the high-quality products adapted to the new expectations of consumers are not selling?"
"Other professions lower down the food chain are also affected."
"This is true of small butchers and specialist butchers, who refuse to give up their right to remove bones in their shops when they only work with healthy carcasses."
"Farmers have already made huge efforts to ensure quality, labelling and traceability, for which they are not always compensated."
"Large-scale distribution continues, in fact, to favour cheap meat, even if this means importing from third countries."
"If, as we are told, society has opted for quality, it must stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in this process."
"It has become crucial to launch information campaigns to reopen dialogue and to finally restore confidence between consumers and producers."
"This step is essential to finding a way out of a crisis that is still unfolding."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we must bear in mind at the outset of this evening' s useful and necessary debate on the monitoring of the BSE crisis is the confusion, the distress, the suffering and the fury of farmers, whose possibilities, prices and morale have all been struck by a veritable earthquake that has shaken their world, ruined years of work on breeding and good practices and has caused them to be distrusted by consumers, which they feel is particularly unfair."
"We are concerned to see that, in many farming regions, as you know, Madam President, large numbers of still young farmers are leaving the business because, unable to put up with the consequences of a crisis for which they are not responsible any longer, they are forced to stop farming."
"In some cases, their despair leads them to take violent action, even to commit suicide."
"The Commission, which reacted so badly and so slowly to the outbreak of this crisis, first by denying it and then by playing down its severity, appears today, probably to get itself off the hook, to be prolonging the matter by imposing whole ranges of measures which do nothing to allay consumers' concerns; they risk destabilising the markets and increase the costs of making changes to the industry, whilst at the same time proving itself to be more generous in laying down regulations than in providing money."
"The European testing programme for scrapie enters into force this month."
"Is this good timing when each test costs as much as a sheep' s carcase and cannot currently distinguish between the prion which causes scrapie, which is harmless to humans, and the prion that causes BSE, which can be transmitted to humans?"
"Furthermore, Argentinian meat imports have started up again."
"Is this really the right time, when some parts of Argentina remain infected with foot-and-mouth disease?"
"Incidentally, the special purchases programme, set up by the Commission is about to be abolished, on 31 March, and according to Agenda 2000, the intervention mechanism for beef and veal is due to end on 30 June 2002."
"I call on the Commission to state unequivocally that these deadlines will be put back, because going ahead with these blows to the beef and veal industry would be like cutting off the oxygen to an injured person who is being resuscitated."
"Instead, we feel that at a time when the BSE epidemic is at very different stages in the various Member States, it is the vigilance of the States themselves that provides the bests results."
"In the United Kingdom, where the disease originated and which has had 99% of all clinical cases, the measures, which admittedly took a long time to be adopted and an even longer time to be properly implemented, are now bearing fruit."
"The number of BSE cases has steadily fallen by 40% per year to reach fewer than 1000 cases last year, whereas in 1992, there were 36 000."
"In France, where the epidemic is more recent and where systematic screening over the last eighteen months seemed to initially increase the number of cases, there has been a slight decrease since the end of 2000."
"The other countries affected have a lower rate of prevalence and also appear to be in control of the situation."
"As you are aware, it is now Japan' s turn to be infected by the epizooty that we have experienced."
"In Europe, we must now, therefore, allow the authorities of the Member States to get on with their work so that farmers can regain the total confidence of consumers, whilst, within the Union, resolutely making the necessary efforts to provide real traceability."
"Consequently, with regard to France' s maintaining its ban on British animals and meats, the European Court in Luxembourg - the judgment should be read in its entirety - has acknowledged that the ban was largely justified due to the still insufficiently reliable traceability within the industry in the United Kingdom."
"It is also crucial to effectively implement, by means of systematic and rigorous inspections, the same quality and safety requirements, in order to provide consumers with the same guarantees for meats imported from third countries as for Community meats."
"Item 25 of the draft resolution that has been presented to us makes a timely insistence on the importance of this issue by emphasising the Commission' s responsibility to ""ensure that the same safeguards are applied with regard to imports from third countries as apply to Community products, in particular as regards BSE testing, the temporary ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal and the proper removal of specific risk material."""
"Furthermore, the Commission should also inform us, as well as the Member States, of the results of its inspections."
"To sum up, Madam President, consumer confidence, which is crucial if our farmers are going to find new hope, will only fully return when they see that in the European Union, public health protection comes before the dogma of free trade."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Olsson on his work and also on the willingness he has shown in incorporating the suggestions he received from all Members of Parliament into his report."
"The report' s explanatory statement gives a perfect account of the BSE crisis from its origins in the United Kingdom in the 1980s."
"The 180 000 infected bovine animals in Great Britain, in addition to the 1 325 in the rest of Europe by the year 2000 and the 101 human cases of new variant CJD have raised serious issues about animal feed and have highlighted the far from harmless effect of this feed on the food chain."
"Today, fortunately, we can congratulate ourselves on the scientific advances made in discovering the cause of the disease and on the efforts being made by the Commission and the Member States to eradicate it once and for all."
"However, there are still some loose ends that need to be tied up in order to complete these investigations and implement the measures that are strictly necessary, because the measures that have been implemented are extremely costly to public and private funds, and for this reason, we must not ask for anything that is unnecessary, even though it costs nothing to ask."
"Consequently, I wish to put forward the idea that, until there is scientific evidence to support it, we should neither gratuitously request that the age for obligatory BSE testing be lowered, nor should we ask for the list of risk material to be extended."
"It would be a different issue altogether were veterinary scientists to recommend this, but, as things stand, they have not done so."
"With regard to conclusion No 27, which calls for a reform of the CAP to tackle this problem, I would say that the CAP deals with a great deal more than food safety alone and that this safety is sufficiently complex to be addressed within the reform of the CAP."
"This is well understood by the Commission and hence the White Paper on Food Safety, the European Food Authority and all the legislation on food safety and animal feed that we are revising in this legislative period."
"This is the framework in which the technical and regulatory actions to be taken to guarantee food safety in the whole food production chain and not in the CAP are established, although one side-effect of it could be to impact on some aspects of the CAP."
"Finally, as has been said on many occasions, we think that if the crisis was not tackled earlier, it was not due to a lack of research, studies or mandatory regulations."
"It was due to a failure to implement standards and to a breakdown in the appropriate controls for their implementation."
"These are areas in which we should have more influence in the future."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"It is beyond me why, after putting so many strict measures in place, we are still fighting BSE."
"Due to the unknown incubation period, the measures that have been taken only take effect in the longer term."
"It is therefore possible for new cases of the serious Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to emerge, against which we are still powerless to do anything."
"We have to be very frank about this."
"On the other hand, we can also state that, by the compulsory removal of specific risk material, a guarantee is put in place that the carrier of the disease no longer ends up in the food chain."
"Since it is no longer permitted to feed cattle animal and bone meal, I expect that, in time, the number of cattle infected with BSE will be relatively small."
"At some point, we hope that tests will show that we are at the level we were at prior to the BSE crisis, namely a few cases per annum."
"Unfortunately, the testing of cattle for BSE has disastrous side-effects."
"If one cow appears to be infected, the entire herd is slaughtered."
"However, this makes no sense."
"BSE is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease."
"Infection is caused through the feed and is passed on down the breeding line. That is why the birth and feed group need to be traced and tested, and not the cattle accidentally sharing the same shed."
"It is irresponsible to sacrifice healthy animals to a false sense of consumer confidence."
"We went against God' s creation by turning ruminants into cannibals."
"We cannot conceal our shortcomings with futile measures."
"We will once again abuse God' s creation if we slaughter and destroy animals unnecessarily."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is using the Olsson report not only to take up a position on the current BSE situation, but also, in particular, to look into the future."
"Our objective is to guarantee food safety, and we will not have reached it as long as our knowledge of this disease is incomplete."
"That is why I particularly support the demand for the resources needed for continued research into TSE diseases to be made available by the Commission."
"We need to learn more about these diseases and epidemics, which were previously unknown, in order to be able to combat them more effectively."
"Society's hysteria, which was particularly marked in Germany, is diminishing."
"People are going back to eating meat, and are again buying it cheaply."
"There is a need for clarity about who, in the European Union, is to bear the costs of additional impositions such as tests and investigations, and conditions for this must be the same from one Member State to another."
"We must, in the same way, see to it that regulations are transposed in the same way in every Member State."
"The provisions of the TSE Regulation need to be stringently applied, with tough penalties imposed for disregarding or fraudulently evading them, not only as regards the production and utilisation of animal feeds but also tests, regulations on slaughtering and the disposal of hazardous material."
"Animal feed is the target of criticism as much as ever and will continue to be so until we have open declaration and can at last check to ensure that only what is listed on the container is actually in it."
"We cannot carry on being driven by fear of fraud, improper treatment and erroneous identification to destroy valuable substances and, apart from that, to import materials or feed from overseas, for example, where we have no influence on their production and composition."
"That is why I put working towards openness, ease of control, and truthfulness right at the top of the list, for only by them will we achieve credibility and trustworthiness."
"Until that day, the ban on feeding omnivores with meat and bone meal will have to stay in place."
"It follows from this, though, that the Commission urgently needs to develop innovative methods of disposal and recycling, such as, for example, the production of biodiesel from tallow or fats."
"It must at least be made clear that unprocessed offal, waste water, fat and tallow still have to be treated."
"We intend that this report should promote greater awareness and urge the Member States to be unstinting in their efforts to beat this disease."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, on his excellent work in compiling this report."
"As a farmer myself, and someone who had a beef herd, I can testify to the wholesale damage and destruction that BSE has done - not only to the beef industry in my own country, but also in Member States throughout the Union."
"So I welcome his efforts in fighting BSE."
"This is a scourge that we must defeat across the whole of Europe."
"I welcome any moves that will strengthen the efforts already made in the UK and by the Commission to stamp out BSE."
"However, the report also raises some serious questions that are to be addressed if we are to maintain the efforts to improve food safety."
"Firstly, I do not believe that the whole-herd slaughter policy has any scientific base for adoption."
"BSE is not a contagious disease and cannot be spread between cattle."
"As we have seen with foot-and-mouth, to adopt the scatter-gun approach to disease control policy of mass culling does nothing to instil confidence in the consumer and only serves to spread further concern."
"In fact, if a farmer has to lose his whole herd for one case of BSE he may be less inclined to declare the animal and may bury it instead."
"I ask Commissioner Byrne to review the whole slaughter policy for BSE in the EU."
"Secondly, there have recently been worrying cases in the UK of beef being illegally imported from Ireland, which breaches the UK's very strict regulations."
"In the UK at present we have a scheme in place which prohibits beef over 30 months from entering the food chain."
"In one recent case, beef over 30 months from a plant in Cork was shipped illegally for processing and then resale within the UK."
"It is a testament to the tough and stringent controls in place in my own country that this particular breach was picked up so quickly and effectively."
"But I call on the Commission and other Member States to ensure that their own authorities are as vigilant against this dangerous trade."
"Finally, there have been far too many cases of meat containing specified risk material being exported into the United Kingdom."
"The growing number of cases and the fact that they come from so many Member States - Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Ireland, to name but a few - must be a huge concern for us all."
"I am not seeking to apportion blame in any way, but if we wish to see the farming industry - particularly the beef industry - flourish in Europe, we must all shoulder the responsibility to enforce the rules."
"What I am calling for is a mood of resilience and an ardour to implement the EU regulations and the tough controls that we have in place, and for us to work together to improve the inspection regimes in all Member States."
"I call upon the Commission to take a more robust attitude to the enforcement of this regulation."
"We have found in the United Kingdom that the only way to rebuild the beef industry is to rebuild consumer confidence."
"We will only do that by guaranteeing the public a safe product that they can trust."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report focuses principally on public health and food safety."
"Feeding with infective animal meals or fats is still regarded as the principal trigger for BSE."
"It is irresponsible, in view of the experience we had of poor adherence to the ban on feeding ruminants with animal meal, to think at present in terms of lifting the general EU-wide ban on it."
"Moreover, consumers would find it incomprehensible."
"All animal meals still kept in stock, as well as feed containing them, must be destroyed without delay in order to prevent future cross-contamination of feedingstuffs."
"There is a particular and connected danger presented by the animal meals, some of them infective, still stored in other states."
"The smallest amounts of this material is sufficient to cause infections, and this is yet another reason not to lift the ban on feeding with it."
"Guaranteeing the safety of humans and animals most certainly and fundamentally presupposes a working and stringent system of controls in the Member States."
"I welcome the strict prescription of effective tests for BSE in all the Member States, and also the demand that the age for testing be reduced to 24 months."
"The Commission must also intervene in favour of the introduction of the open declaration of all feed ingredients in all nation states."
"Even before the Central and Eastern European states accede to the EU, they need to set up working systems alongside our own to oversee the safety of food and feedingstuffs."
"There is an especially urgent need for slaughterhouses to be reorganised so that the immediate removal and disposal of hazardous materials in accordance with European directives may be guaranteed."
"Imported food must be every bit as safe as that produced in the European Union, and so tests for BSE must now be made obligatory in countries outside the EU."
"The safety of food, including that which is imported, is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily."
"We must make it our concern."
"Madam President, in the previous legislature, this issue was dealt with mainly by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whereas the committee responsible is now the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"This is right and proper, for in this tragedy - a tragedy which is equally great for all - there are in effect two victims, also equally affected: the consumer and the farmer."
"I remember the long hours of debate, the on-site inspections carried out at the beginning of the committee of inquiry' s work and then during the work of the supervisory committee monitoring the committee of inquiry, set up because Parliament did not have confidence even in the information provided by the Commission; in effect, it proved to be severely lacking in many areas."
"Now we know more than we did then, for the world of science has also provided some answers and clarified the main issues somewhat."
"We now know that the bulk of the blame for this tragic affair lies with the State, with the world of politics."
"Basically, there are some Member States which have been less diligent in enforcing precautionary rules and, above all, bans, over the past two years."
"Other States seem, once again, to have adopted, as in the past, the approach of a conspiracy of silence, in what could be described as an irresponsible attempt to hide and minimise the impact of the tragedy or - at least - the problem."
"Already, in the past, precisely this attitude of lack of transparency has caused the most severe damage for farmers, for they were the butt of suspicion, mistrust and discouragement on the part of the consumer."
"I therefore feel that the most important part of the Olsson report is precisely its loud call to governments to enforce the rules properly and thereby restore the confidence of the citizens, whether they are consumers or farmers, with an adequate information campaign and, most importantly, with sufficient support not least for those who are the direct victims of the tragedy: the farmers."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is, I believe, beyond dispute that public health and food safety are matters of importance to all of us, producers every bit as much as consumers."
"Preventative consumer protection is on everybody's lips, but my understanding of these things leads me to believe that our role as politicians is not to give additional impetus to the emotional discussions that are still being carried on about the ongoing handling of the BSE crisis."
"For my part, I do not want to help discussion of matters concerning BSE to slavishly follow the spirit of the age."
"In view of current events in Germany, I favour the strictest controls right along the food production chain."
"We also, of course, need the toughest sanctions when offences are committed."
"In the meantime, I advocate testing for BSE from 24 months."
"Now, when can we actually expect science to come up with definite findings on how individual animals get the disease?"
"I think that when that does come to light, we could say goodbye in no time to the idea of killing off all our livestock."
"Until then, going down the road of mass slaughter is only one alternative."
"The feeding of omnivores with meat and bone meal will no doubt continue to be prohibited, at that for a variety of reasons."
"We will certainly maintain the current ban on feeding with animal meals for as long as the open declaration of feedingstuffs is not made mandatory and for as long as the processing of offal from healthy animals cannot be carried out with any guarantee of safety."
"I will mention, though, the formulation used in Mr Olsson's report. He, too, says 'for the foreseeable future' ."
"'For the foreseeable future' means, for me, that the future may perhaps find us back on a better road ahead."
"Let me conclude by saying that it is easy for us to explain to any critically-minded consumer that healthy meat on healthy bone is part of good diet."
"Processed healthy bone in animal meal is, though, apparently a danger to the omnivore."
"Just try making sense of that."
"We could take numerous other examples to illustrate this state of affairs."
"I take the view that we, bearing as we do political responsibility, have to get back to discussing things in a more matter-of-fact way."
"Madam President, we still know very little about BSE, a disease that has shaken the whole European agricultural sector."
"We urgently need new research into what causes it and how it spreads."
"There is no reliable proof of the quality of the screening process."
"The call to lower the age of animals to be tested from thirty months to twenty-four months is hardly relevant."
"In most cases, the disease is still diagnosed in animals when they start to behave strangely."
"The possible connection between calf feed and BSE must be studied."
"There has been no clear explanation for recent individual outbreaks of the disease."
"It is nevertheless worth supporting the disposal of stocks of bonemeal and tallow."
"The disease must not be allowed to spread by accident as a result of contaminated feed."
"There must be unambiguous declaration of ingredients in animal feed, and responsible cattle breeders must be able to make the right choice on the basis of reliable information when purchasing animal feed."
"The wellbeing and health of animals must be safeguarded."
"There can be no transitional periods allowed for new Member States joining the Community with regard to food hygiene and declarations of quality and ingredients, as the new Member States will be joining a real internal market."
"The applicant countries must be given technical and financial support in the prevention of the BSE risk."
"We have to ensure that the measures will also continue after the enlargement process is over."
"A lot was done last year to bring BSE under control and this brought results: for example, consumer confidence in beef is starting to return."
"At this stage it is reasonable to remain cool, reinforce the measures that exist, and await the outcome of new studies."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank Mr Olsson for his good and critical report, which does a thorough job of highlighting some difficult points."
"The common concern of us all is, without any ifs and buts, the maximum possible safety of our food, which, though, should also look good and taste good."
"To produce this food, we need farmers, we need agriculture and we need agro-food production."
"That is still the case."
"It is this fact that prescribes the frame of reference in which we are at present working on this own-initiative report."
"The report rightly highlights a series of shortcomings, no doubt the most serious of which is the appreciable difference in the ways Community legislation is implemented in the absence of any common level of protection."
"This is where, in my view, the Commission is meant to be able to intervene and should be in a position to do so."
"The precautionary principle must be adhered to by any means available."
"Current events in Bavaria and the Rhineland Palatinate show how important responsible controls are."
"We must therefore hold fast to the imposition of strict sanctions when binding regulations are not complied with, but I counsel a more cautious approach where a scientific justification has not, to date, been found."
"I cannot therefore go along with testing for BSE as early as 24 months, with the ban on feeding with leftover food, even if it has been treated in accordance with contemporary scientific knowledge, and, likewise, the idea of slaughtering the whole stock when a case of BSE occurs, which is something I reject."
"There is an urgent need for more research into comprehensive food safety."
"We need farmers to be well-trained, good managers, motivated and - which is most important - respected by society, and these farmers need a fair price for what they produce."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to thank Mr Olsson most warmly for taking upon himself the very difficult task of drafting this report."
"Ever since the first case of BSE occurred, Parliament has always very closely observed and discussed the steps taken at both European and national level to deal with the crisis."
"It is important for us, the farmers right across Europe, that all possible steps should be taken to avoid future food crises."
"The precautionary principle, already mentioned by many of my fellow Members, must be adhered to, and the latest medical findings must be taken into account."
"One difficulty that has become apparent is that of the marked divergences between Member States in the way they implement EU regulations and the partial absence of details as to how and to what extent Community legislation is being transposed."
"I am in good company when I say that, above all, though, much firmer measures must be taken in respect of non-compliance, including the removal of hazardous material."
"I do not believe that it is sensible to provide for the reduction to 24 months of the age at which tests are carried out."
"I think this would give rise to unjustifiable costs."
"Tests should continue to be carried out at 30 months in order to obtain secure results."
"I therefore also support those amendments that provide for this."
"As I have already said, the greatest protection is offered by proper slaughtering and removal of hazardous material."
"Let me make another observation. I really would like to make the point that the common agricultural policy surely already does justice to the objective of food safety even now."
"In my opinion, there is no absolute link between the continuing handling of BSE and the treatment of food leftovers."
"The BSE crisis was, as we know, triggered by the production of animal meal under improper conditions and the equally improper feeding of it to ruminants."
"The problems of recycling should be dealt with in another report."
"A second consideration to which we should give attention is that the subject of animals, which are actually omnivorous, should be dealt with elsewhere, in a report of its own and not in this report, which is actually only on the ongoing handling of BSE in ruminants."
"Madam President, I am very encouraged by the recommendations in Mr Olsson's report and his support for the Commission's approach in this."
"I want to thank him for this report."
"His extensive experience in this area is evident from the detail and the high quality of this report, and I thank him for that."
"There is too little time available to speak of the recommendations that the Commission can support."
"I would like, therefore, to concentrate on those recommendations with which we differ or where there appear to be differences within Parliament itself."
"The recommendation to reduce the age of testing of bovines to 24 months is an example of this."
"Almost eight million tests were carried out last year on healthy animals aged over 30 months."
"The youngest positive case in these animals was aged 41 months."
"This suggests that there is no immediate urgency to lower the current age limit."
"However, the situation will remain under review."
"Another issue where there is some confusion is in relation to the Commission action in cases of poor implementation of BSE measures by the Member States themselves."
"I have gone on record repeatedly to the effect that the existing enforcement mechanisms, namely the infringement proceedings, do not have sufficient teeth."
"The Commission's intention is to present a proposal to the Council and Parliament shortly on food and feed controls."
"This proposal will fundamentally review the inspection systems in the Member States."
"In the process it will also propose much stronger action, including stronger sanctions, which many of you have referred to as having been contained in Mr Olsson's report."
"The question of financial penalties in the case of fraud or serious malfunctioning of a national control system is being considered in this context."
"The incidence of BSE in the Community gives mixed signals."
"The total number of cases in 2001, excluding the UK, is likely to be in the region of 1,000 cases."
"This is more or less double the 482 cases registered in 2000."
"However, most of this increase was due to the impact of the generalised testing of healthy and at-risk animals with the newly available rapid tests."
"In addition, frankly, Member States that previously were not looking very hard for BSE have now learned their lesson and have hugely improved their surveillance efforts."
"Nonetheless, there is still room for improvement in the area of implementation, as the reports of the FVO consistently highlight."
"Another continued difficulty is the problem in the Member States in coping with the huge volume of meat and bonemeal which must be destroyed."
"The Commission has actively reminded Member States of their obligations to respect Community law in this regard and I would refer to a number of contributions from Members of the House on this matter, and would draw your attention to the fact that there is legislation in place relating to this issue which must be complied with by Member States."
"Finally, the continued uncertainty over the possible presence of BSE in sheep is also of concern, and many of you referred to this."
"A decision was taken only last week to substantially increase the level of testing for TSEs in sheep."
"This will provide a much better picture of the potential problem facing the Community if the presence of BSE in natural conditions is ever confirmed in sheep."
"So, I greatly welcome this opportunity to respond to Parliament's initiative in the report."
"It is only a little over a year since the most recent crisis peaked."
"We have made a lot of progress in the meantime."
"At this stage I should summarise the key measures that have been put in place."
"First of all, the use of meat and bonemeal in animal feed has been suspended."
"Testing for BSE has been introduced for all healthy animals aged over 30 months and for at-risk and casualty animals over 24 months."
"The list of SRMs has been extended, notably to include the vertebral column and the entire intestine of bovines, and mechanically recovered meat from the bones of ruminants has been banned."
"There has also been very important progress on the legislative front."
"Regulation No 999/2001 on TSEs was finally agreed and entered into force on 1 July 2001."
"Very good progress has also been made on the animal by-products proposal, with the question of how to deal with catering wastes as the main obstacle to final agreement."
"The agreement also on the open declaration of animal feedingstuffs and on the Food Safety Authority will also greatly strengthen the overall framework in relation to TSEs."
"Turning to imports from third countries, there are already a comprehensive series of measures in place under the TSE Regulation and its implementing provisions."
"The FAO has undertaken a series of inspection missions in the candidate countries in recent weeks and months."
"Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay will also be visited shortly."
"The reports on these missions are now coming on stream."
"It appears that while there has been some progress, further important efforts are still required to achieve full compliance in these countries."
"I am very concerned that they should not repeat the mistakes of the Member States in their handling of the BSE problem."
"The Commission will be actively calling on the countries concerned to take urgent corrective action."
"I also intend to raise the matter in the meeting of the Agriculture Council with the candidate countries scheduled for next month."
"Let me conclude by thanking Mr Olsson for his report."
"I want to assure Parliament that the Commission's attention remains firmly fixed on TSEs."
"I am insistent that there will be no complacency."
"I know that Parliament will continue to keep a close eye - rightly - on eradicating this disease."
"There were a number of points raised by Members that I would like to refer to."
"In the UK there is now testing of all bovines born between August 1996 - the date of MBM ban - and the end of 1997."
"The youngest positive test was found at 41 months."
"That is in respect of eight million tests of healthy animals."
"I should emphasise that there is no question ever of lifting the ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminants."
"That ban is in place and will remain so."
"There is no debate concerning that issue."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to thank Commissioner Byrne."
"I am delighted that he replied so clearly to my direct question concerning sanctions and that this is an issue which is being dealt with by the Commission."
"I am really looking forward to our being able to adopt a position in this House on the Commission' s proposal concerning the way in which the issue is to be handled."
"I see this as a major step forward when it comes both to this issue and to the control and inspection of foodstuffs generally."
"I can also tell the Commissioner that I share his view of the proposal to reduce the age of animals that are to be tested for BSE to 24 months."
"That was not my proposal."
"Rather, it came from elsewhere."
"I shall therefore help vote down this proposal tomorrow, using the same arguments that the Commissioner used."
"I want to take the opportunity of thanking you, my fellow MEPs, for all your kind words."
"It has been a pleasure to work on this report."
"I would, however, emphasise in conclusion that the danger is not over."
"As we have seen during 2001, new cases have been discovered in many other countries, not only within the EU but also in the candidate countries, Slovenia and Slovakia, as well as in Japan."
"BSE is still a problem."
"I share the view expressed by Mr Whitehead concerning the BSE investigation which proved to have been carried out on cows' brains instead of sheep' s brains."
"That means that the only thing we know in many of these situations is that we really do not know anything, or that we do not know a sufficient amount."
"That is why there is a need for research."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Climate change"
"The next item is the report (A5-0025/2002) by Mr Moreira da Silva, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the joint fulfilment of commitments thereunder (COM(2001) 579 - C5-0019/2002 - 2001/0248(CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been waiting for ten years, since the Rio de Janeiro Conference, for this moment to arrive."
"It is true that the absence of the United States makes the Kyoto Protocol less universal than we would have liked."
"It is also true that the Protocol is less ambitious than originally intended."
"Nevertheless, the alternative to this small step would be incomparably worse: without the political agreement reached in Marrakech, we would have to waste another ten years in negotiations on drawing up a new Protocol."
"I am, therefore, pleased that tomorrow we will adopt the Kyoto Protocol and we hope that this can enter into force as early as this year."
"There is, however, one aspect of the Council decision that concerns me. I am talking about the alleged desire of Denmark to reopen discussions on the burden sharing agreement, which was approved in 1998."
"Such a renegotiation is unjustifiable, unacceptable and would heap ridicule on the European Union' s international standing."
"We should remember that, very recently, we censored Russia for attempting to do exactly the same thing."
"However, in addition to this environmental message that demands that we act, approving the Kyoto Protocol also sends out other political signals that are worth highlighting."
"Firstly, it has proved that it is possible to regulate globalisation."
"Secondly, the European Union has demonstrated its capacity for leadership and, in this particular instance, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the admirable way in which she has exercised this leadership."
"Thirdly, it has created a new economic paradigm, the carbon economy."
"From now on, the price of a tonne of carbon will be quoted on the markets and carbon dioxide emissions will represent a cost to be reflected in the price of all products."
"The winners will be those able to produce the same things using cleaner technologies."
"Having assessed the situation, let us now talk about the future."
"Between 1990 and 1999 the European Union already achieved a 4% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions."
"Nevertheless, the lack of commitment by the vast majority of the Member States is still a matter of serious concern and the situation is very worrying in some sectors, such as transport, in which it is predicted that emissions will increase by 50% in the next ten years."
"Given this framework, the community instruments proposed by the Commission are to be praised, specifically the European Climate Change Programme and the directive on emissions trading, on which the European Parliament is due to deliver an opinion within the next six months."
"However, although we know what the Community strategy is, what role should the Member States play?"
"In my view, the Member States must not fall into the easy temptation of only implementing reduction measures that entail low costs in both economic and political terms."
"This would basically be an attempt to resolve the problem by cutting emissions in industry and in the energy sector without tackling the transport or civil construction industries."
"This option would be environmentally dishonest and economically irrational."
"By avoiding applying the policy to some sectors, Member States would not only be wasting an opportunity for technological change but would also run up a much higher reduction bill for the future."
"The strategy must, therefore, involve a reorientation of economic polices, internalising the environmental costs of the 'greenhouse effect' in all economic sectors."
"This will only be possible if we introduce certain measures that are considered to be consensual, such as the production of renewable energies, energy efficiency and public transport, in addition to clearly unpopular measures such as ending subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, an energy tax and a tax on carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector."
"I shall conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups for their cooperation and commitment."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the presentation of his report, and also for his commitment to climate protection in recent years."
"I would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Wallström, who has done everything to make it possible for us to now discuss in definite terms the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which, we can now, thank God, get to grips with."
"Tomorrow we can say only 'Yes' or 'No' to the Kyoto Protocol, but it has taken a great deal of work to give us the chance to say 'Yes' to a comprehensive agreement."
"I thank all those who have played a part in this."
"The Kyoto Protocol has come in for heavy criticism and will continue to do so."
"Most recently, as the rapporteur has mentioned, it is burden sharing on which criticism has again been focused."
"I will say here quite openly that burden sharing merits criticism, and that those who say that the burdens are shared unfairly, are right."
"No one, though, is reducing too much; all the Member States are reducing too little."
"The experts tell us quite unambiguously that, if we want to put a stop to climate change, we must reduce greenhouse gases by 50% worldwide."
"The magnitude of the task and the pettiness of the discussions between the Member States about this first step - which is, after all, a very modest one - is shown if we work on the basis that the industrialised countries need to reduce by over 50% in order for the developing countries to have any kind of chance of achieving some sort of prosperity for themselves."
"India produces a tonne of CO2 per head of the population, as against the Member States of the European Union with about 10 tonnes on average. Against such a backdrop it is bad enough that some EU Member States are permitted to increase their emissions, and that the Member States that produce a very great deal of pollution, such as the one from which I come, complain about now having to reduce their emissions by a relatively large amount."
"The Kyoto Protocol is only an initial step and must be followed by many others."
"We should not, therefore, be small-mindedly discussing the number of places after the decimal point, but energetically striving for a sustainable economy, being careful with resources and saving energy."
"Madam President, I also wish to welcome the Commissioner at this late hour."
"I cannot help but wonder if it is always the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that meets on Tuesday night during the part-session in Strasbourg or whether we are regarded as some kind of suspect fundamentalist sect that is always placed lowest down on the agenda."
"That would be pretty odd, given that we are responsible for one of the most important issues in Parliament, namely that of the environment."
"I should like to ask both the President and the Commissioner to look into whether it would be possible to change this, that is to say whether it would be possible at least sometimes to raise the status of environmental issues by debating them in the daytime and not always after nightfall."
"I had really intended to begin by parodying a well-known Conservative politician in Sweden who once said that he was not only a Hallander but also a European."
"I should like to say, today, that I am not only a proud Gothenburger but also a proud European."
"I am proud to be able to say that Parliament has now concluded its debate on the Kyoto Protocol, and I look forward to the Council' s also being able to ratify it in March."
"I am particularly proud, however, of having been able to participate in the little delegation that visited the United States last week."
"We were given the opportunity of discussing the climate issue with both Congress and the House of Representatives."
"I have the sense that there is not only a physical ocean separating the continents but also a mental ocean, given the way in which the United States regards the climate issue and believes it should be handled."
"Certainly, the climate issue has now been recognised as a problem in the United States because their own researchers have stated that it is a problem."
"However, it is still believed that the solution to this problem is to be found in the United States."
"It is this view that most divides us."
"The United States regards a global environmental threat as a domestic problem that only concerns Americans, while the European attitude is that the issue should be dealt with jointly."
"I therefore wish to thank the Commissioner for having taken such an active role and also thank the rapporteur of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has kept us together and ensured that we have held a common view and position beyond the frontiers of Europe."
"We need, in the future, to stick together not only in theory but also in practice."
"That cohesion will be put to the test following ratification, as it will also be when, a little later on in the spring, we debate the European Climate Change Programme and emissions trading."
"It is just unfortunate that certain members of the Council will feel the need to make a fuss about the way in which the burden is distributed."
"It is pretty pathetic that it is Members from a Scandinavian country who will be doing this."
"However, there are black sheep everywhere."
"Whatever the case, I am pleased that we are able to conclude the debate on the Kyoto Protocol today."
"Thank you, Madam President, the Kyoto Agreement is an historic agreement, the basis of which was laid in Rio in 1992."
"Bush senior was in two minds whether he would actually go to Rio, but he eventually went and signed the Rio Agreement."
"The attempt to conclude an agreement with the Clinton/Gore administration in The Hague at the end of 2000 failed."
"It was disconcerting to witness how Bush subsequently discarded the Kyoto Agreement."
"Fortunately, the breakthrough came in Bonn in July of last year - a major breakthrough - and it is for my group of great importance that nuclear energy plays no role, either with the CDM or with the Joint Implementation."
"Parliament will ratify the Agreement tomorrow."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has already given us a taste of what to expect: 33 votes for, 0 against, 0 abstentions."
"We will see similar figures tomorrow too."
"We will be voting unanimously."
"Hopefully, the Council will do the same, which on 4 March will first need to iron out a minor Danish issue, but I feel confident."
"Europe has taken the lead, and I, too, should like to thank Commissioner Malmström for her boundless commitment."
"As far as the content is concerned: 8% less in Europe and 5% less in the industrialised world, is far from good enough."
"However, Kyoto is the only international Treaty we have for combating global warming."
"And like the Ozone Treaty, it will need to be improved many times."
"But Canada, Japan, Australia and Russia still need to ratify the Treaty first."
"This will hopefully be done before the Rio Plus 10 Summit meeting in Johannesburg."
"Like Bush senior, Bush junior is in two minds whether he should go to Johannesburg."
"Hopefully, like his father, he will decide to attend after all."
"Last week, we were in Washington with a small delegation, and there are indications that the United States is actually under pressure to change its attitude."
"The Democrats were embarrassed about the fact that their country was not participating in the Kyoto Protocol, and a number of Republicans too have seen the light."
"Bush will probably proclaim a national climate policy soon: a modest, partial disengagement from economic growth and energy consumption."
"Not good enough but far better than what he stated a year ago."
"We have made it clear that the economic costs of such a policy for America will be greater than the costs of taking part in Kyoto."
"It is also satisfying that a number of large concerns in the US want America to take part in the Kyoto Protocol."
"The question is no longer whether, but when, the United States will take part."
"Three major questions remain."
"First of all, there is the implementation."
"Attaining 8% less is starting to become a serious matter."
"Then there is the discussion about the objectives following the initial period."
"One per cent less per annum is a very good start, and I hope that the Commission can confirm this."
"Finally, the most important and most difficult issue is to persuade the developing countries to come onboard in due course."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as Mr Moreira da Silva reminds us in his report, ten years have passed since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit."
"I hope that in September we can celebrate the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"We will have to consider whether or not these last ten years have been wasted."
"Whilst on the one hand we recall how reports, financed mainly by Americans, were falsified during this period to show that climate change did not exist, in the same way that any scientist who insisted on the problems that climate change could cause, was discredited, it is also true to say that public awareness has greatly increased over these ten years."
"In other words, we may have wasted time in implementing measures, but the level of public awareness is higher than ever before."
"I think that today we are all aware of the significance of the Kyoto Protocol, the meaning of climate change and its associated effects, such as the submergence of islands, the destruction of coastline, the massive displacement of millions of people and the loss of biodiversity."
"Therefore, I think that we have made gains on the one hand even if we have suffered losses on the other."
"It is also true that, from 1990 to 1999, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced in Europe, but it must be said that this is due, to a large extent, to two countries in particular, for very specific reasons."
"There are many countries, such as my own, whose greenhouse gas emissions have increased - excessively, to my mind."
"Spain' s emissions have increased by 23%, although the possibility that at the next Council of Ministers, according to today' s papers, the Spanish government will decide to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is to be welcomed and is good news."
"This is an example that other countries should follow, to be able to reach, in September, the figure of 55 countries needed to ratify the Protocol, which account for over 55% of all greenhouse gas emissions."
"I believe, in agreement with some of my fellow Members, that the final result is not as ambitious as expected some years ago, but, as Mr Moreira da Silva also states, the alternative would be much worse."
"We have to work to ensure that States ratify the Protocol, but also that they implement specific measures, with the priority of those economic sectors that pollute the most, such as transport."
"The rapporteur very clearly states that emissions caused by transport could rise by 50% over the next decade."
"Priority measures should be direct action in key economic sectors."
"I also agree with Mr Moreira da Silva that the balance that has been achieved should be left alone, for, as many of my fellow Members have already said, Mrs Wallström and this Parliament have done some great work and, although it may be modest, the step forward is very significant."
"Madam President, the Kyoto Agreement is very important and we can all be satisfied that at long last it is to be adopted."
"The EU has shown astonishing powers of leadership in talks on climate change."
"Without that, the Protocol could not have been saved."
"European companies have had to agree to strict measures to try to achieve an 8% reduction by 2012 compared to the 1990 levels."
"Our competitors in the United States do not have to withstand this burden, President Bush has stated quite coolly that this way he is protecting American industry and production."
"The EU cannot bear the responsibility for the entire world alone."
"The USA, Russia and China must all commit themselves to a common aim."
"This has been insisted on strongly at WTO talks."
"It is not merely a matter of commercial policy but the world we share and our future."
"The burden has already been shared within the EU."
"Now there is talk of emissions trading."
"We cannot let emissions be auctioned off; we have only bad experience of the UMTS and other auctions."
"I am especially worried about those industrial sectors and companies that have already made massive investments to reduce emissions."
"These responsible companies cannot now be allowed to pick up the bill again."
"Surely it is nobody' s intention to force successful and environmentally caring companies out of the market?"
"The Union' s need for energy is only increasing with economic growth, regardless of the savings made."
"To achieve the Kyoto targets we have to continue to save energy and adopt the use of renewable energy sources."
"To ensure the supply of basic levels of energy, however, nuclear energy is the only realistic option."
"Madam President, it is quite remarkable how Parliament is united across the boundaries of group and nation on this issue, and the Commission and the Council, too, are of the same opinion, that we want to ratify Kyoto."
"I hope that tomorrow's vote will see us achieve the greatest possible majority and perhaps even unanimity on this issue."
"There is a cultural significance to this, for - if I am right - Europe would be assuming cultural leadership on an important issue for the first time since the Second World War."
"In the past, we always followed the Americans, trailing them by five to ten years."
"This time, Europe is indeed ahead."
"That is something that I welcome."
"Only a few, though, are aware of what this ratification signifies."
"Signing it takes no time, but putting it into practice is extraordinarily difficult."
"Some have already referred to that."
"I find it all the more regrettable that, on this issue, we - we, the popularly and directly elected European Parliament - are only being consulted."
"This is a great economic upheaval - and we are only being consulted."
"That strikes me as extraordinarily regrettable, although I must say that I would still say 'Yes' to Kyoto if Parliament had the right of codecision, and I assume that my fellow Members would do likewise."
"I also call to mind the fact that we are acting on the basis of the precautionary principle, which has, in the meantime, found its way into our lawmaking."
"Were we not to act, our inaction could, under certain circumstances, lead to us being sued in the European Court of Justice and compelled to ratify Kyoto."
"This agreement also has its advantages, for we are putting our industry and ourselves under pressure to develop the most energy-efficient products and processes, and, finally, we are making ourselves competitive, even though I cannot deny that there will also be difficulties for some branches of industry."
"Madam President, the European Parliament could have insisted that the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol complied with what is called the assent procedure, whereby this legal instrument could not have been brought into force in the Community without the approval of the European Parliament."
"Against certain legal advice, we are now, however, satisfied that our opinion on this matter is being heard, and this is because we have said how important it is to have the Protocol ratified at long last."
"Parliament is really doing its utmost now to see that the Kyoto Protocol will be in force when the meeting on sustainable development is held in Johannesburg in September. That is very important."
"I would like to add my thanks to those expressed here both to the rapporteur and the Commissioner."
"It is certainly true that this process, which has now ended with the acceptance of the Kyoto Protocol by the Community, will not be the last indication that the European Union can demonstrate a real capacity for global leadership, and can also show its citizens, as the rapporteur stated, that globalisation can also be controlled if proper rules are applied to it."
"There has also been talk of the economy in this debate."
"It is important to realise that a good number of companies have already become aware of just how much potential there is for business in policies on climate."
"We must also have confidence in this and include the United States in the process."
"As my colleague, Mr de Roo said in his speech, a large number of companies in the USA wish the United States would become involved in this process."
"It may actually be, as my country' s Minister of the Environment has said in this connection, that the USA will become the last open-air museum of the old technology unless it joins in these efforts."
"Now we have before us the task of implementing the Kyoto Agreement in practice in the Community."
"Thanks go to the Commission for the swiftness with which it proposed a directive on emissions trading as well as a large-scale climate programme just before the Marrakesh Conference."
"This spring the European Parliament can now participate with determination in drafting the rules of this directive on emissions trading."
"I believe that in this we will be acting with the express purpose of seeing to it that the companies that have already played their part will also receive a reward of some sort, and that all the other companies will also be tempted to join in."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as Mr Moreira da Silva stated, on 4 March the Kyoto Protocol will be submitted for ratification to the Environment Council."
"I am convinced that the Spanish Presidency is determined to overcome any last-minute difficulties that could arise and that the result will be satisfactory."
"This will mean that the European Union is taking another step forwards in leading the struggle against climate change."
"We have seen once again this evening that the United States is widely criticised for not sharing the level of commitment the Protocol demands."
"This puts all EU Member States, and this is particularly true if we are able to get the United States to sit around the negotiating table, in a position of urgent need to fulfil each and every one of the provisions laid down in the Protocol, unless we want to suffer total ridicule and have our reputation in international politics tarnished."
"Nevertheless, although achieving the Kyoto objectives will not be easy, it is possible."
"This is demonstrated by the data in Mr Moreira da Silva' s resolution."
"We must become a society that is poor in carbon and rich in the use of cleaner technologies, taking full advantage of energy efficiency."
"We know that the role of the market is crucial to achieving these objectives, but we are still hesitant when it comes to implementing specific measures, above all when we give in to those short-sighted sentiments that still perceive the Kyoto Protocol as an attack on competition and employment when it should be seen, because it can now be seen, that the opposite is the case."
"We must act on demand at Community level on aspects such as the internalisation of costs, emissions trading and the exchange of certain policies such as transport, energy or agriculture."
"With regard to demand, we must focus on training and motivating some European consumers who are still very apathetic and uninformed in this regard."
"I believe that the rapporteur has tabled a proposal that is committed to sustainable development, which is clear and precise in stating exactly where we need to act."
"For this reason it deserves, and I think already has, this Parliament' s gratitude and total support."
"Thank you, Mr Moreira da Silva."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to say that I welcome the European Parliament' s draft resolution on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I wish first of all to thank Mr Moreira Da Silva for the report and for the fact that it has been possible to resolve this issue of such political importance by means of a vote in Parliament at an early stage."
"I also want to take the opportunity to emphasise how much I value the cooperation with the European Parliament concerning the Kyoto Protocol."
"Your efforts, including visits to the United States and contacts with parliamentarians in different countries, have been extraordinarily important."
"The cooperation we have had during the negotiations, especially under Mr Moreira Da Silva' s leadership, has contributed to our having come as far as this on our home ground."
"I also wish to say that I consider it self-evident and very important that Parliament should be fully involved in the work we are now doing on the European Climate Change Programme and on the proposal concerning emissions trading."
"For some years, the EU has of course advocated that the Kyoto Protocol should come into force at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg in September of this year."
"If it is to be possible to achieve this objective, the EU should set a good example."
"Mr Liese and Mr Linkohr are right: even though we can quarrel about the distribution of the burden, this is just a first step if we want to take the climate experts seriously."
"It can only be seen as a first cautious step along the road."
"I am particularly pleased about Parliament' s support for the proposal' s being adopted as soon as possible so that we can ratify the whole proposal by no later than 1 June, when the Member States have concluded their own national procedures."
"I want to comment briefly on what is termed the Danish problem, which is to be regarded as a technical complication."
"It is also in terms of a technical problem that we are trying to solve the issue."
"At the Council meeting in December, the Environment Ministers agreed that we should try to find such a technical solution and that a decision should be taken during the Council meeting on 4 March."
"I hope that this will be possible."
"If this decision is adopted at the Environment Council meeting in March, this would be a clear signal that the EU is determined to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, a move that would strengthen the EU' s credibility and leadership role in the matter of combating climate change."
"It would also increase the pressure on other parties, for example Japan and Russia, to follow our example."
"The prospects for this are fairly good, given the way things look at present, particularly in Japan."
"At the same time, we are going to continue the dialogue with the United States and try to convince them to resume the Kyoto negotiations or at least adopt similar measures on a national basis to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"If we are to be credible, we must put our own house in order first."
"In plain language, this means that our first priority must be ratification and effective implementation of the Protocol on the part of the EU."
"Thank you for your views and for this debate."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Education and training systems"
"The next item is the report (A5-0017/2002) by Mrs Martens, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission communication on the draft detailed work programme for the follow-up of the report on the concrete objectives of education and training systems (COM(2001) 501 - C5-0601/2001 - 2001/2251(COS))."
"Madam President, education is an important topic, and I am therefore pleased that the Spanish Presidency has selected it as one of the spearheads of its activities."
"This report is about developing the objectives which the Commission has formulated in the field of general education and occupational training."
"At the Lisbon Summit, it was stated that the European Union was to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustaining economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"This is an important objective which is also attended by the necessary urgency if we want Europe to be accorded a respectable place on the economic and cultural map of the world."
"Education is rightly regarded as an important instrument for attaining this objective."
"It is no less justifiable to apply all existing brainpower and experience."
"This is why I regret that the European Parliament was not involved in drawing up these objectives, was not consulted and can therefore now only react to the programme which the Commission has in mind for developing the objectives."
"Having said that, I do agree with the goals which the Commission is formulating: increasing the quality and effectiveness of education; facilitating access to education; and opening up education and training systems to the world."
"The Lisbon Summit thus wanted Europe to do more to promote the knowledge-based economy, sustainable growth and social cohesion."
"Unfortunately, the Commission report mainly refers only to the first two objectives."
"The focus is on new technology, expertise in the field of ICT, getting boys and girls interested in education and technology, etc. This is important in occupational training which prepares people for making a professional contribution to society."
"General education is broader."
"Not only does it prepare people for working life, it also has a duty to prepare people to function in society as people, as citizens."
"This dimension is missing from the Commission communication."
"The Commission is thinking of education too much in terms of the economy and the labour market."
"In other words, it mainly wants to educate people in their role as economic players."
"When we talk about a future Europe, when we talk about a stable Europe, a Europe with social cohesion, then education has a role to play in that field too."
"This is particularly the case since education, notably general education, has in many countries been given a strongly complementary function in relation to the family."
"Education in my own country, the Netherlands, is in crisis, in my view."
"There are too few teachers."
"The quality of education is going down, there are complaints about the level of knowledge of students about to embark on a university degree, there are too many regulations, etc."
"There is also insufficient funding."
"There are problems in other countries too."
"That is why I am pleased that consideration is once again being given at European level to the objectives of education and training, and that concrete testing criteria are also being formulated, with due respect for subsidiarity."
"In my report, where social cohesion and a stable Europe are concerned, I call for indicators to be formulated and applied which home in on skills that people need to function well in society."
"Communication and social skills spring to mind, as well as knowledge and understanding of other cultures and a developed sense of citizenship."
"As already stated, education also offers, of course, a preparation for working life, but must certainly also contribute to educating people into an awareness of democracy and of the notion of the rule of law, as well as helping to educate people into becoming active citizens who not only have their own self-interest at heart, but also the public interest."
"Needless to say, the report must be seen in the context of other programmes which touch upon education, such as lifelong learning, mobility and language programmes, etc. Lifelong learning is important when we talk about improving access to education for all, not only for young people, but also older people, not only for healthy people, but also for those with a handicap, and not only for the native population, but also for foreign people."
"I should like to conclude with one remark about language education."
"With a growing, open internal market and with a society which is becoming ever more multicultural, the importance of a knowledge of languages is growing."
"This is why, in the report, I subscribe to the objective that all pupils should be proficient in two languages in addition to their mother tongues by the end of their compulsory education."
"Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise the importance of this report, which underlines the fact that the role of education does not consist merely of preparing young people for employment - even if employment also underpins society and is a means of gauging inclusion and economic and social reproduction."
"It is generally said that training is about filling in the gaps."
"The same applies to education."
"What we really need to do here, therefore, is define what these terms actually mean, which is not happening today."
"We must, therefore, also discuss the definition of the gaps that we want to fill with our education and training policies."
"Definitions of this matter are not unanimous; it could even be said that there is a profusion of definitions and that this very profusion reveals our political leanings and the values that we advocate, individually and collectively."
"To my mind, the greatest challenge of this decade is that of social cohesion."
"In a world in which everything is going faster and faster and in which speed of movement has become a factor in the generation of wealth, there are increasing numbers of men and women for whom the doors to work, to culture and to knowledge are closed."
"I would go so far as to say that exclusion is on the increase and that this trend is harming our various strategies for social cohesion, a concept which we are nevertheless fond of in the European Parliament."
"Consequently, the gap is continually increasing between a growing number of European citizens and what I would call the world of money."
"This divide illustrates not only the distance between the individual and the market, but also the confusion, the loss of meaning in a collective system within which there are two groups: those who make the rules and those who merely follow them."
"We must, therefore, urgently discuss the issue of the continuous assessment of the European social model and of the price that we are prepared to pay to produce this social cohesion, this citizenship."
"In this context, we must do everything we can to ensure that the decision of the Lisbon European Council, confirmed by the Stockholm European Council - which, in strategic terms, places economic growth, better employment and greater social cohesion on an equal footing - becomes a reality for all and that finally, everyone, without a single exception, has access both to the social skills required by citizens and the professional skills required by economic producers."
"I now call on the Commission to take my suggestion fully into consideration and put in place the necessary policies for social cohesion to no longer be the consequence of other strategies and become a fully-fledged, high-priority approach in order to safeguard public welfare, in other words, the harmonious and dignified development of Europe' s citizens."
"Madam President, according to Hegel, culture - that is, philosophy - spreads its wings only at the falling of the dusk, but it is getting on for dawn here!"
"In any case, in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for the Martens report, I would like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur on her work."
"I am not greatly opposed to any of it and would just like to highlight a few particularly important points."
"I feel that it is important - as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has also pointed out - that this report should address the issue of education not just in terms of professional training, of the development of skills which will increase our citizens' chances of finding high quality work, but also in terms of more general education, of which school education is part in a wider sense, directing it towards a humanistic culture which - although it does not directly provide professional skills - certainly achieves that task of social cohesion which is our goal."
"The same may be said of the report' s focus on equal opportunities for all citizens and the possibility that European Community action might remove those gaps, those divergences and distances which, in our society, still divide those who have skills, who have access to a computer and information technology, for example, from those who are still excluded from this world."
"These are the main principles of the Martens report and I feel that Parliament cannot fail to support them."
"This is the line taken in both the report' s declarations of principle and its practical recommendations: it focuses especially on the need to root and ground these recommendations in the changes currently taking place in the world of communications and in new teaching methods and, above all, to facilitate the climate and conditions necessary for the need for a higher level of quantity and quality of education for all to be met."
"In this respect, all the measures seeking to actively involve teachers, students and trainers in the implementation of the programme are vital."
"The emphasis placed on language learning, on strengthening the ties between the world of work and civil society, on the need to find more attractive images to encourage students and teachers' learning and mobility must not, however, mask the practical root of the problem: the need for financing which respects the choices of the individual."
"To this framework we need to add a top priority action plan to assess and intervene with appropriate, effective tools in the tensions which can develop in the worlds of education and work where there are cases of discrimination, with the common desire to fight racism and intolerance."
"For all these reasons, the Committee on Culture thanks the rapporteur once again for her work and calls upon Parliament to adopt the Martens report."
"Madam President, I welcome the report on the Commission communication on the concrete objectives of education and training systems."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for her conscientious work."
"In line with the goals of the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils, it is vitally important that we enable the generation of young Europeans to choose European research careers and European scientific disciplines."
"I also agree that companies have to play a key role in training students and employees."
"However, before submitting the report we should pay attention to the following points. There seems to be a gap between the proposals in this report and the progress made by the Commission and its expert group so far."
"My understanding is that the Commission has already started its work on social inclusion and reset its goals on the Leonardo da Vinci programme by, for example, including older people and disabled people within its scope."
"This is welcome."
"We look forward to the European Year of Disability in 2003."
"In addition to that, one should not neglect the efforts made by the Commission on cooperation with the candidate countries at all levels."
"While not wanting to undermine the good work of the Commission, I must say that more can be done."
"We should also underline the importance of encouraging increased integration of European Union, Member States and regional initiatives in order to make efficient use of the relatively small budget for education and training systems."
"In this respect I would suggest better cooperation between the different kinds of funding and an exchange of best practice, together with better dialogue between the supranational, national and regional decision-makers within the Community."
"Finally, I would like to see more attention paid to the lack of equal opportunities for all individuals to experience better European integration throughout their professional lives."
"There are possibilities within the budget to facilitate exchanges of experience of vocational training systems in the different Member States."
"I encourage this."
"Europe can offer better education for everybody."
"Parliament's report should not forget to underline that."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Commission and Mrs Martens on her report, although I must admit that, like a pupil at night school, all I can think about is going home to bed. This is a detailed and, I think, exemplary programme of work because it systematically links the objectives, the indicators and the timetable, thereby giving us a benchmark."
"But what we have to ask ourselves is, what sort of benchmark is it if, when it comes to the crunch, we shy away from a real policy of educational convergence at European level."
"We ignore the main differences, we are not willing or perhaps able to do anything about them or our priorities lie elsewhere and we use the Bologna method to set targets which every Member State has yet to meet."
"I have my doubts, which I have already voiced to Mrs Reding."
"Nonetheless, I think that it is a benchmark and we shall see in a few years' time how hard it is for some and how close others have come to it."
"But I think dialogue is indispensable, and not just at the level of Parliament."
"We need to find a way of formulating an opinion and a view before we are presented with faits accomplis."
"We need dialogue at school unit level."
"Teachers are strongly resisting indicators, at least in Greece."
"Most indicators are quantitative, only a few are qualitative, meaning that the picture we get will not always be the most accurate, and we do need the most accurate picture."
"I also share Mrs Martens' view that we need more indicators on education systems, not just training systems."
"And here the Commission proposal really is one-sided."
"I know we are all worried about unemployment, I know that we want to leave school with prospects of getting a job rather than joining the dole queue, but a general education for young children is equally valuable."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.10 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the sitting"
"Mr President, I do not want to comment on yesterday' s Minutes, but would like to make an observation of a different kind; so I hope you will allow me to do that first."
"Indeed, I understand - and I am speaking as the coordinator for my group for the ACP Meeting - that none of the Commissioners will be attending the ACP-EU Meeting in Cape Town in four weeks' time."
"Not one single Commissioner, not Mr Nielson, nor Mr Patten, nor Mr Lamy, nor Mr Fischler, for that matter."
"In order to avoid a huge disgrace, you could perhaps make an urgent appeal to the European Commission to ensure that a Commissioner attends this Meeting, for an entire programme of questions in writing and such like are on the agenda there."
"It is also a disgrace in respect of the 70 developing countries that the Commission is not making an effort to attend the ACP Meeting."
"This would be the first time that this has happened, and I have been attending ACP meetings for years."
"Hence my urgent request that an appeal be made to the European Commission."
"I will take it up with the Commission, Mrs Maij-Weggen, and when we have the response we can come back to the House."
"Statement by the President of the European Parliament"
"We come to the next item of business - and here I would like to thank the Conference of Presidents and colleagues in the House for taking a short policy statement from myself, followed by a debate, to talk a little bit about the next two and a half years of the presidency."
"When I spoke after my election on 15 January I said I would like to claim the privilege which is a common privilege of the newly elected President to address the House on our strategic purpose for the coming period."
"In deciding to speak today it was in deference to the fact that on the Wednesday of that part-session the Spanish Prime Minister was here to launch the Spanish presidency."
"One thing I want to bring to this House - and I hope we will all work on this together - is an ability to communicate who we are and what we do."
"So when you wish to communicate something you need to pick your moment and you cannot pick a moment which on that day belongs to someone else."
"Thus I am availing myself of the opportunity this morning."
"The great sense that I carry from the campaign which preceded my election as President is that there is an enormous appetite for change in our House."
"Despite that, it is a frustrated appetite in terms of the delivery of change."
"We need, through the different mechanisms - the Bureau, our committees, the Conference of Presidents - to convert that appetite for change into actual change on the floor of this House."
"My invitation to colleagues today is to seize this opportunity to create the change for which there is self-evidently such an appetite in this House."
"I hope in the next period before the election that we can be a reforming parliament in a visible way and that we can be a communicating parliament and a parliament that is prepared to take risk for change."
"This will require creativity and imagination on the part of everyone and together we can face that challenge."
"In effect what I should like to invite you to address in our debate today is a willingness to engage in creating a culture of transformation."
"It is now more than two decades since direct elections were introduced and we need to review how we do our business."
"We need to create a more vital and dynamic sense of parliamentarianism on the floor of this House."
"The greatest transformation in hand of course is enlargement."
"The time has come for us, the political class, to repossess enlargement."
"It is inevitably the case that the acquis communautaire requires an enormous amount of work on the part of the European Commission and on the part of the public service in the candidate states to deal with all of the detail."
"But surrounding that detail is the wider political challenge - and that is our challenge."
"This House is uniquely well-placed to lead the politics of the transformation towards an enlarged Europe."
"We are now entering the end game on the enlargement debate and we have the complex budgetary proposals which no doubt the House in due course will express itself on."
"It is important that the era for change which is enlargement should not be reduced to a budgetary debate about small change or large change, however one may perceive that to be."
"We have to take initiatives in this House to drive that agenda."
"I want this Parliament to be the place where the vitality of the enlargement debate plays itself out."
"Although the calendar is not yet firmly set, it seems to me that on two occasions this year we are likely to discuss enlargement, probably before the Seville summit at the end of the Spanish presidency and probably again in November."
"I would like to ask you, especially in the political groups, to consider a formula where we can invite MPs from our political families from the candidate states to participate in our enlargement debates with us this year, to create a sense of vitality, to create a moment which is a very European moment, and to do it in terms which allow us to hear the different voices."
"They may be voices of accord or discord on some of the issues, but it is a really vital time and I hope the House will find within its mechanisms, and through the groups, a willingness to explore and create this platform, to express in a parliamentary sense this new Europe."
"Eventually, following from the example of German reunification more than a decade ago, I would hope that the House will agree that, when the candidate states sign the accession treaties that have yet to be ratified, we might consider budgeting and planning for full observer status so that we create the avant-garde for the new Europe and that we do it in this House because it is our public purpose to give real political leadership."
"Subject to these details and to getting agreement - because we need to work through it as regards budgets, we need to work through it in our Bureau, we need the agreement of the Conference of Presidents on our calendar - I should like in the coming months and before the Seville summit if I can, to visit every candidate state on behalf of this Parliament and to issue to them, to our parliamentary colleagues, the formal invitation to be the avant-garde for the new Europe and, if you allow it, it will be your invitation to them and my privilege to deliver it on your behalf."
"(Applause) In the context of foreign policy and on a wider basis I hope in a number of ways that we can up our game."
"Europe needs a new foreign policy and I am certain in this House there is a majority and a will to create that foreign policy."
"In forming and developing strategic partnerships with the United States, with Russia, with a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, with a dialogue of civilisations, we are engaging in politics that are vital not just to the parliamentary process which is the image of the European Union itself."
"In this House we have great credibility in terms of our appetite to fight global poverty, disease and famine."
"In this House we have a wonderful and proud record in the promotion and defence of human rights."
"We must be determined to continue to play a leading role in this but we must find new platforms to express our leadership."
"It is not simply that we need to follow events but we ourselves, as a Parliament, have the capacity to create new platforms to offer a lead."
"In the last few days and weeks, thanks to the work of so many colleagues in the House, we have begun to move towards a new and more mature form of political relations with other institutions and in particular with the European Commission."
"I congratulate Mrs Malmström in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, for the work which they have done in securing a landmark high-quality agreement on how we will go about the legislative process from now on."
"We need it and the work is excellent."
"(Applause)"
"I congratulate the House for the overwhelming vote of support yesterday for the report by Mr von Wogau which will allow us to adopt an effective interim solution - and it is only an interim solution - on the financial services reform pending, through the Convention, and through the Intergovernmental Conference, a new basis in the Treaty on which to conduct our institutional relations, on which to promote the role of a democratic Europe and on which to promote this Parliament's role in representing citizens in a vital way."
"I would like in particular also to pay tribute, because these two reports have come through the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the leadership role and qualities of Mr Napolitano whose work in this House has contributed so handsomely to these achievements."
"(Applause)"
"The thread of consistency in all of these measures is the primacy of politics itself."
"That is our business."
"We also have to give a signal to the Commission, to the Council, to the wider world, that we in the European Parliament are mature and reliable partners in the project that we share in terms of European integration."
"The counterpart is that I want to work now in the lead-up to the Barcelona European Council, with the Commission and with the Council, to get a meaningful interinstitutional working group."
"The primacy of politics comes to zero if the platforms to develop politics are not there."
"I say this to the Council: the time has now come for it, with the Commission and Parliament, to deliver that platform and to give us the ability to restore and to develop the primacy of politics, to prepare ourselves for common work on the Convention and for successful and common outcomes of substance in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We must not forget also that we here in this House are a tribune of the peoples of Europe."
"Our essential public purpose is to serve our citizens."
"We can create and we can communicate a new pride in this Parliament."
"Our determination must be to accentuate the democratic over the technocratic, to insist on openness and to connect our message in every way we can with a wider European public."
"I am very proud of the fact that it was on the floor of this Parliament that we, the parliamentarians, created, developed, explained and won the argument in favour of a Convention, in favour of a new way of creating the new Europe, in favour of an open and democratic and transparent way, in favour of trying to get in touch with a rising generation of Europeans who are untouched by business behind closed doors."
"The old permissive consent to allow the elite to proceed is no longer there in the old way and so we must earn the consent and respect of a rising generation."
"We can only do it through open methods and the Convention must be an open method and can be a very significant start."
"Parliament can claim an ownership of the idea."
"But we also have a key role as a stakeholder in this Convention."
"Our determination as Parliament is to promote the democratic Europe over the technocratic Europe and to insist on openness."
"In that regard, it is my view - and later today we have the possibility in the Conference of Presidents to meet the President of the Convention - that we must ensure as a Parliament that the Convention itself in its open work is the primary platform, is the main way, is the open discussion that leads to the way forward."
"It is important - and we have distinguished colleagues on the praesidium to help to lead this debate - that this is a well-managed Convention."
"But its management must assist the Convention itself to be a real platform for open debate."
"I have asked the services here, in terms of connecting this debate to the wider public, to ensure that it is broadcast on a continuous basis on video-streaming, so that those who wish to follow - whether they are journalists, people working in research institutes, students in universities, different groups in the socio-economic sphere in Europe - but who are not in Brussels for its work, can do so on a regular basis."
"Colleagues, we still have a long way to go on the question of internal reform."
"I read the book Mes combats produced by my predecessor Nicole Fontaine."
"She spoke in it about the Members' Statute and about the virtual impossibility of making progress on that issue."
"I do not know what progress we can make but I express this hope today."
"I would like to bring closure to the Members' Statute."
"I want to work with the rapporteur, Mr Rothley;"
"I want to work with key colleagues in the Bureau and the College of Quaestors."
"But firstly I want to talk to Members in this House to try to develop, mobilise and motivate a majority for change."
"Over the coming weeks, we will engage in an intensive round of consultation with Members."
"There will be no statute over the head of Members - I give you that guarantee."
"But there can be no statute without mobilising the majority - first in here."
"Then, of course, even if we do that, we still have to rely on the Council to deliver its part of the contract."
"But I want to start the first phase right here: to know the ground we stand on, to create a clear will for this change and then to try to bring closure to it."
"It is politically important to do so before the next European elections."
"I hope you agree and I hope you will help to create that climate for a majority for change."
"(Applause)"
"I mentioned at the outset that there is a great appetite for change."
"Very many colleagues feel that the House lacks vitality in many of its debates and we need to work on this."
"I look forward to the Corbett report and whatever change that may bring."
"I do not prejudge its outcome - it is still a matter of debate and controversy."
"I have no monopoly on wisdom, but we know - even as far as it goes or may go - that the Corbett report itself is just a start."
"The House will decide on the Corbett report - the President will not."
"But a point I want to make: whatever powers that gives to the presidency to try to regulate how we do our business on the floor - to have fewer votes, more work done in committees and then to create space here for real political debate - I will use it to the maximum extent."
"So I want people to know in advance: whatever that platform is, I want to use it in a way that opens up space to have creative political debate on the floor of this House."
"We had a wonderful debate yesterday on the Middle East but we need a lot more of that class of activity because we are a political institution."
"In that regard - I claim no monopoly of wisdom in this - I cannot displace the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - but I pose, Laeken-like, a number of questions."
"Why is it when we have a debate that the groups have not so far been able to agree that somewhere - maybe for the last third - we actually ask colleagues to respond to each other?"
"Why do we not create a dynamic which demands that we debate and not simply read statements?"
"Some way or another we need to respond to each other."
"Should we consider on committees, that where there is a report where there is broad agreement but where there are key amendments on which there is clear disagreement, that we could through the Conference of Presidents debate only the key amendments?"
"It is sometimes done on the floor of the Congress in the US - not the whole debate but the debate on the key amendments, because that is the part that has the political voltage running through it."
"We need to look at some of these things and I invite you to look creatively at them, because we need more vitality and we ourselves can gift this to ourselves if we are creative enough."
"The acquis communautaire to which I referred earlier on enlargement, covers 2 500 legislative acts over 50 years and 85 000 pages of legislation."
"On the Eur-Lex website you will find half of those acts in a consolidated form - not yet the law, because we have never made a law to consolidate all those acts - but you will nonetheless find that half the acquis is now on Eur-Lex in its shortened form."
"I am told that through consolidated text we could reduce the 85 000 pages to 25 000."
"That is already very big but it would be some achievement."
"I believe that we should work with the other institutions to do this as a matter of priority."
"It is a failure in strategic planning that it has not been done already."
"It should have been done in advance of enlargement, for which these 85 000 pages of text are now being translated."
"However, we should do it primarily for citizens who want to connect to European law, to find in one place one consolidated text that explains their rights and the limits to them."
"I hope that we can engage in an exercise with the other institutions on this."
"We as Parliament have a public purpose to bring real value to debate, to be a continental-scale legislator."
"I want over the next period to try to sell our story better than we have done in the past."
"I want to propose to the Bureau a comprehensive stocktaking exercise in order to provide Parliament with modern and streamlined information policies."
"I want with you to develop a communication strategy before the next European election in 2004."
"We will have to invest in intellectual honesty and political realism to recognise past defects; to look at the underlying reasons for those defects; to look at any confusion about images of our institution in the eyes of the public."
"We have many strengths to build on, not least our unique status as the largest elected representative assembly on our continent."
"The pivotal role that we play in the Convention itself also requires a special exercise in communication."
"As I said earlier - and I close on this - we must earn the consent of today's generation of Europeans."
"This is the tribune of the people where that process must play itself out: creating a cultural transformation, recognising our responsibilities towards enlargement, towards building new strategic partnerships, stressing the primacy of politics, reforming the House, communicating our public purpose."
"These are the aims of my presidency."
"They can be summarised in one phrase: working together to create a Europe fit for its future."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had the opportunity to congratulate our President on his new office on 15 January, and I want to do so again today."
"Mr President, I would like to express our group's congratulations and appreciation to you for the way you have just spoken."
"One got the feeling from your speech that your role as President is not just a representative duty for you, but that politics, what we can do here in Parliament, is something close to your heart."
"In any case, it is that sentiment that communicated itself to us."
"We want to thank you for that and express the hope that you will be able to keep to this policy in these two and a half years of practical work."
"Mr President, I feel particular gratitude for the way you spoke out in favour of us inviting observers from the candidate countries to Parliament and to our groups once the treaties have been signed."
"I think that this idea, which our Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats has promoted for some time, is an excellent one."
"We must make it clear that political debate must not be dominated by such issues as when agricultural aid is going to be fully operational in the candidate countries, when these or those other conditions are going to be complied with, but we must rather be saying clearly even now to people in the candidate countries: you are welcome in our community of shared values."
"That is why we also want soon to welcome to Parliament members of the national parliaments as observers, as partners in dialogue, as people with whom we can discuss the future of Europe. We are right alongside you if you are about to put that formally into effect by means of resolutions."
"You rightly spoke about the strategic partnership in the Mediterranean countries, in which context you mentioned human rights."
"It is easy for us in this House to talk about human rights in quite abstract terms."
"We have been talking about terrorism in recent weeks and months."
"My group is definitely in favour of combating terrorism, but, in the weeks, months and years ahead, we must take care not to permit violations of human rights in the name of counter-terrorism."
"This means that we must speak out when human rights are violated."
"Let me give Chechnya as a quite specific example."
"We must not close our eyes to what is happening in Chechnya just because we say we have to combat terrorism."
"This is something we cannot allow!"
"(Applause)"
"You mentioned interinstitutional balance."
"It is with great disquiet that I see how some governments are now trying, for whatever reasons they may have, to cut down to size the European Commission's role as Guardian of the Treaties."
"Even though it may bring us into dispute with a government on our side, our group will not permit a crucial Community institution such as the Commission to have its rights and powers interfered with."
"It is the Commission that is the Guardian of the Treaties!"
"Madam Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, we urge you to pursue this approach with determination."
"We are there alongside you."
"Much has been said about the Convention."
"We are, in fact, going to be discussing it this afternoon with the President."
"I believe that, right from the start, we have to counteract the impression that it is not the Convention that is to play the principal role."
"We have a praesidium in which there are three people with specific offices: the chairman and his two deputies."
"We need working procedures for the Convention."
"That is the new method and you have given it expression."
"We need a way of working that is transparent and public, and that is why the Convention as a whole must be at the heart of the work."
"The work cannot be delegated to the praesidium, to the triumvirate of the chairman and his two deputies."
"It is clear that the leadership function naturally devolves upon the praesidium, but the work tempo - including the frequency of the Convention's meetings - must be such that it is the Convention that conducts the debate on the future of Europe."
"Turning to the issue of the statute, which you have addressed, our group supports the introduction of a Members' Statute, but we also say that Members' independence, integrity and dignity must be guaranteed, and, in law, it is we who draw up the Members' Statute - and not the Council!"
"So, at the end of the day, this is not about us saying 'yes' to something proposed by the Council, but rather we are the ones who make the proposal, and then we must work with the Council towards a result."
"Please permit me a concluding observation, Mr President."
"You have just referred to Mr von Wogau's report on the financial services proposals and on the Lamfalussy Final Report, on which we voted yesterday."
"I am addressing my remarks to Mr Ramón de Miguel and to the Council when I say that this was a fine hour for the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"If that is how we go about our business in future, we will achieve something."
"This is not just about which of us - Commission, Council or Parliament - achieves the most; on the contrary, our common task is to get Europe moving."
"Your speech, Mr President, was manifestly in this spirit."
"We stand alongside you, encouraging you to be committed and consistent in giving your words practical expression over the next two and a half years."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I welcome your Presidential programme."
"You started with a statement: the culture of change in this second half of the legislature."
"I would say that, fundamentally, what this requires is the consolidation of the culture of democracy in the European Union."
"We are facing a veritable obstacle race, in political and electoral terms, in the next two and a half years."
"I believe that there are basically two things we must do: one concerns our citizenship."
"We already have European citizenship and the euro, but we must convince our citizens to participate actively in the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament."
"And this is something that we must all do together."
"At the same time, we must focus on those who wish to become citizens of the European Union, the citizens of the candidate countries and try to engage them in the most noble aspect of our great adventure, which is not simply discussing budgetary issues, but sharing a common destiny founded on peace and democracy."
"I would say that these are the noble objectives that we share with a view to making Monetary Union, which is already a reality, into an Economic Union and, above all, as you rightly said, a Political Union, giving primacy to the most noble aspect of politics in public life."
"There is also another important dimension to the European Parliament, which is our voice stating the universal primacy of human rights."
"Not because we are superior, but because we Europeans have learned, in the course of a long and painful history, that human rights are the best cement for maintaining peace and prosperity."
"This is an important point, both with regard to the world that borders our own - I am thinking here of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and also the Mediterranean - and especially with regard to the Middle East."
"I welcome the fact that yesterday, for the first time, a large number of Members took part in the debate on the Middle East."
"We must keep this up."
"With regard to the most tangible issues that you raised, the agenda of reforms, I should like to express my agreement with you, in that the most important thing we can do is to make our message more specific and to give primacy to political debates."
"In this regard, I also wish to thank you for having mentioned the work of the members of my Group, who are also Members of this Parliament, but whom you mentioned specifically."
"First of all, with regard to the reform of the Rules of Procedure, the Corbett report."
"It is obviously Parliament that must decide, but the President also has powers of proposal and of approval."
"The Corbett reform is not only the product of the rapporteur or of the Socialist Group."
"This reform is something as vital to us as the air that we breathe."
"It is absolutely crucial if we are to ensure that our debates resonate beyond the walls of this Parliament."
"Secondly, the Members' Statute."
"At the moment, the Members' Statute, which is a long-standing ambition of this Parliament, towards which we have been working for many years, is not simply something we wish to see. It is constitutionally essential if Parliament is going to be a member of the European Union with full rights."
"This is the issue: we are not simply discussing the problems, the type of Assembly or the advantages that we could gain."
"This is an issue of dignity and of equality between the citizens and their representatives."
"As you know, you have always had the support of the Socialist Group on this matter, and considerable progress has been made by recent governments that are part of our political family. I also hope that you also maintain your resolute support for the work being done by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, not only because he is rapporteur for the Socialist Group, but as I have said on other occasions, because this is the birthright of the entire Parliament."
"With regard to defending democracy within the European Union, I welcome the agreement reached yesterday on the Lamfalussy programme on the basis of the von Wogau report."
"I wish to highlight a few points that I consider to be crucial and which should lead to Parliament maintaining a very firm stance."
"First of all: governance."
"This is an absolutely crucial issue and we must prevent a drastic reduction of our powers and a return to commitology."
"I urge you, Mr President, to ensure that the interinstitutional working party announced by President Prodi in the December Plenary and which the President of the Council, Mr Aznar, also ratified here, is set up as quickly as possible so that we do not see our power of codecision eroded."
"Secondly, immunity."
"Recently, there has been a major shortcoming on an essential issue, from the point of view of the dignity of Members."
"I am counting on you to take this issue seriously so that we do not find ourselves in a situation in which a fundamental aspect of parliamentary dignity is rendered meaningless."
"Lastly, the Convention."
"I also thank you for having today appointed Giscard d' Estaing as its Chairman."
"The Convention is the daughter of our parliamentary work, but it also has other partners and members and I think that Parliament must act as the keeper of the conscience in this field to ensure that the Convention is visible to the public, achieves tangible results and is not simply a forum for discussion."
"Furthermore, it must be able to push forward and develop something on which we can all agree."
"As you know, Mr President - and with this I shall close - we supported an excellent candidate, Mr Martin."
"I see that you have integrated many of Mr Martin' s ideas into your campaign, but in any event, I should like to say that if you implement this programme, you will have the loyal and honest support of the Socialist Group in this work, which concerns all of us."
"Mr President, my dear Pat, congratulations once again, this time on your new professional début."
"It is splendid to see you doing what you promised."
"You are showing yourself to be trustworthy."
"We have obtained a new Europe today, but we have also had a new Parliament since January."
"Now, we are to be politicians, not technicians, and you have shown, and will show, us the way."
"Pat, we are hungry, in fact very hungry, and we have an appetite for change."
"Our group will support you entirely as you prepare the individual dishes that can satisfy us."
"However, our group will always have an appetite for change."
"In Denmark, we have a lovely song that our family often sings."
"It goes like this: 'Life' s harvest is in struggle never ceasing...' , '...while changeless calm is death' s abode' ."
"Our group has always wished for struggle, for we have an appetite for change."
"Enlargement is the most important matter we are facing at this time."
"It is about people rather than about technical devices, budgets, laws and rules. We are clearly the place where people are to meet, and we must make this place work."
"Our group will do everything to move the tradition on, as we have already done by now inviting members of the national parliaments in the candidate countries to visit us."
"What is most important, however - and what we have a very great appetite for - are reforms to this House of ours."
"We have a need for reforms, and not only reforms of our statute - important as those are - but also changes to the way in which we work, so that we can deliver the results our electorate wants to see."
"That leads me on to my next point, concerning contact with the people."
"The prerequisite for being in touch with the people is that we should be able to deliver the goods and, more specifically, the goods that people demand."
"That means being able to put our own house in order and being effective and concentrating on what is really important and what we have some influence upon."
"In those terms, what is most important are reforms, results and communication, and certainly it is splendid to hear you communicate."
"You are enthusiastic, you show your feelings, you are colourful in your speech and you use the right words."
"I would almost go so far as to say that we in effect have a female President, for you employ the feminine side of your personality: imagination and creativity; and that is what we need if we are to reach our citizens."
"We must be politicians, not technicians."
"All right, we were unable to have a woman as President, but a man with feminine sides to his personality is no bad thing either."
"The Convention is what is most important in connection with the Europe of the future."
"Moreover, it is important that we should not just engage in navel-gazing but try to find solutions to the tasks facing us. Rather than get bogged down in a dispute about whether we are to have a 'Constitution' , a 'Basic Treaty' or a 'federation' , we should design a system in which there is democratic control over political decisions."
"When we draw up legislation for our citizens, they must be able to see who are making the decisions, and those who are must be democratically accountable for them."
"That is the message of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"We want to see political accountability in Europe."
"We are ""fit for the future"" , but our group is also ""fit to fight for the new Europe"" , as well as being ""fit to fight for the future together with yourself"" ."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance is pleased with your speech because, in it, you remind Parliament of its political role and do not dwell on technical details, although I am certain that it will take a lot of time to regulate these."
"We do not want to be a well-oiled voting machine."
"We want to make history and we want to highlight Europe' s own role in the world at a time when peace and stability in the world are under threat."
"It is not sufficient to organise development cooperation."
"We must be able to promote peace and stability in a European manner, on the basis of our values."
"We want to maximise our role as a parliament."
"We want to monitor. We want to enact laws on behalf of public opinion but also in contact with that opinion and with the media which should bring us closer to the public."
"A great deal of progress has been made."
"I arrived in this Parliament having had experience of many parliaments before, sometimes parliaments which were usually better attended than this one, a phenomenon which I regret."
"Outside these walls, people often think that we are not a real parliament, but I have found a true parliament here."
"However, we must ensure that we have a statute, we agree with you on that, otherwise we as MEPs lack credibility."
"In addition, we must also further shape the assistants' statute into which Mr Onesta has put such great effort."
"Moreover, we must be given more competences."
"Codecision must be extended rather than eroded, and this must be done in a fully transparent manner."
"Needless to say, the activities must be reformed."
"The will to reform is there."
"A great deal can be done within the current Rules of Procedure, provided that the will is there, the will to debate rather than read out little monologues prepared on paper, the will to be present and to enter into dialogue with each other."
"The debate must not stifle pluralism, quite the contrary."
"We are here to talk, for we are a parliament in which it must be possible to express the whole range of opinions."
"This is why we do believe that the Corbett report is a solid basis for a discussion, but if it means that the rights of small groups are cut back, or the rights of individual MEPs compromised, then we touch the soul and diversity of this Parliament, and that is not acceptable."
"We also want to express our slight concern to the Council."
"Parliament cannot accept shortened procedures if the Council fails to debate with us in our committees."
"We can hold more debates there, but not in the absence of the Council, not without the attendant transparency and not without the debate that we want."
"We must condemn creeping reforms without clear objectives."
"We want more democracy, respect for subsidiarity, a rapprochement between citizens and the European Parliament and a dialogue with the regional and national parliaments. If not, the already strong distrust among our citizens will only grow."
"We must clearly establish the legal basis for our actions once and for all, and not let our legal basis be taken away."
"We welcome your instruction to prepare the future in consultation with public opinion and with the parliaments in the candidate countries."
"You are moving closer to them."
"We encounter them in the joint meetings."
"Why do we not open up our committees to enter into debate with them, as we also want to do with our own public opinion, and why do we not open up our sumptuous chambers more than has hitherto been the case?"
"The Convention will be the proof of the pudding."
"We are putting our trust in this."
"If we want to prepare Europe for tackling the enormous tasks of enlargement, the Convention cannot afford to fail."
"It should not endeavour to write a cookery book, which is subsequently used in some new night-time session to concoct a grim menu."
"We want a Convention that knows the direction in which Parliament wants to guide it."
"As the European Parliament, we must face up to our task in that Convention and involve the others in that debate, both regional and national parliaments, as well as public opinion, and ensure that Europe takes the qualitative step forward that is required for enlargement."
"Mr President, during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament, I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President."
"Basing my comments on the undisputed observation that the increasing numbers of citizens are showing a very worrying lack of interest in the European institutions, I said that the number one priority of the new President should be to do everything in his power to win back their confidence."
"I am therefore pleased to see that this objective is implicit in your programme."
"You said that we must win back the confidence of the people."
"We fully support you in doing this."
"How can this be achieved in practical terms?"
"I myself have come up with three ideas."
"I think that two of them partly cover the same areas as your plans, but I would venture to say that the third idea could remedy a shortfall."
"The first idea concerns the involvement of citizens in the debate on the future of Europe."
"I suggested that our President launch, in parallel with the work of the Convention and in conjunction with the national parliaments, a campaign on the theme 'Let your voice be heard' ."
"This would be an incredibly bold experiment for our institution to undertake."
"We should stimulate a real confrontation of ideas, as you said, we should listen to what the people have to say to us on what they expect from Europe and strive to connect the Convention to the subjects of these diverse discussions."
"Then we should all face up to our responsibilities."
"We want the Convention to shake up the IGC, so let the citizens shake up the Convention!"
"My second idea was for our President to take the initiative, along with ourselves, in organising meetings in Parliament of groups of citizens from various European countries to discuss common objectives that we could support."
"I mentioned three examples."
"The first is to organise meetings involving young people to discuss questions that directly concern them, such as Erasmus-type grants or the full and mutual recognition of qualifications, as well as broader subjects - we could call them more civilisation-related issues, like those that were recently discussed in Porto Alegre, under the alluring title 'Another world is possible' ."
"Another example is to invite women from all over Europe to meet and discuss the question of the full application of Treaty provisions that encourage equality."
"The last example, which is similar to your proposal, Mr President, is to organise meetings of members of civil society from the candidate countries and Member States to examine, together, the ins and outs of this quite historic undertaking and to give us the best possible chances of making it a success."
"In the same spirit, you proposed to invite observers from the candidate countries and we shall support you in this effort."
"The third idea that I mentioned two months ago is the only one that I fear was missing from the speech you gave this morning, and that is the idea of putting pressure on the Commission and the Council regarding several emblematic legislative texts that clearly spell out to our fellow citizens the direction in which we want to take Europe in the future."
"I am personally thinking, particularly at a time when so many businesses are undergoing restructuring, of the directives such as that on the information and consultation of workers, that on the European Works Councils, or even of the framework directive on services of general interest, and am looking forward to the possible - and, in my view, desirable - reform of the Treaties in this crucial area."
"The general approach advocated by my group and the many practical suggestions that turn it into a reality are the same as they were before your election and they will remain thus during your mandate."
"In this spirit, we will naturally be prepared to help you to make our Parliament a positive role model for millions of European citizens."
"Mr President, on a lighthearted note may I firstly say that I am extremely pleased to be here to witness the discovery of the feminine side of your personality, revealed to us this morning."
"Let me also assure colleagues that there is a tougher side to the personality of the President, as I have seen in another House in another place."
"I warmly welcome the statement made by the President to us here this morning."
"I am genuinely pleased with the response to it by the people who have already spoken."
"It augurs well for the change that we know must take place - a change that we have been hesitant to face up to for quite a considerable period of time."
"I would like to go on record as saying that this, in my view, is the first serious attempt in a long time to take up the challenge of the need for change."
"We often see change as something that is always desirable but that can wait until tomorrow."
"Now, with Pat Cox as our President, we must confront it from day one."
"I welcome that."
"There is an obligation on each and every one of us to support that change."
"My Group in particular welcomes the changes that you have outlined in your statement."
"They will make this Parliament more meaningful."
"They will give it the role that Parliament must, and should, have and which we know it has not got."
"They will give us the type of debate that will mean we can put away all the documents we read diligently and carefully on technical matters that we should not be debating at all."
"Let us debate the political issues."
"Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the good debate we had yesterday with the High Representative, Javier Solana."
"It was a good and open debate, but we should have had more debates like that one."
"It should not just be a privilege for us to have Mr Solana present; perhaps he should be here on a more regular basis."
"He is accountable to this Parliament - we should not overlook that."
"That is important too. I was delighted that Commissioner Patten was here yesterday because his is a role that we must respect and support as well."
"I should like to thank the Commission and the Spanish presidency for being here at this most important debate here today."
"They too have a role."
"I have consistently supported the view that the Commission's best friend is the European Parliament."
"Parliament will support the Commission and make sure it is not sidelined by one or two of the larger Member States wishing to do so for any particular reason."
"I also know that the Commission is the best friend of the smaller Member States within the European Union, which can count on protection when they need it."
"As regards the representatives of the Spanish presidency, it is right and proper that they are here today and I thank them for coming."
"Last November they came and met the political leaders of the groups in this Parliament and held open consultations with them on the agenda that they proposed to put forward during their presidency."
"This was a worthwhile initiative that we welcome, value and appreciate."
"It is not so long ago that the outgoing presidency refused to come to this Parliament to report on its activities because it wanted to go immediately afterwards."
"It did not want to answer questions."
"We should not accept that."
"Much reform is required within this House."
"We will support that reform."
"I welcome what Mr Cox has said on the different matters he mentioned."
"He mentioned the need for the statute."
"There is full support for the statute and I welcome the fact that the consultation is going to take place from the bottom up, involving everybody in a decent, fair, upright, open and democratic fashion."
"This will contrast with the past, when Mr Rothley was working on his own and efforts were made just to get a deal done to give a presidency something to their credit at the end of the day."
"That was not good enough then. It will not be good enough now."
"We have all involved ourselves in this debate and something worthwhile will come from it."
"As regards the workings of the Convention, I very much welcome the suggestions that have been made here today."
"I would add, though perhaps not with 100% conviction, that the meeting that is taking place today between Mr Giscard d'Estaing and the heads of the political groups should not have been confined to the heads of the political groups."
"Consideration should perhaps have been given to having that meeting in this House to let all Members see what is going on."
"We have urged Mr Giscard d'Estaing not to have his little meetings behind closed doors."
"We have called for the rhythm of the Convention to be dictated from the floor and to involve the Members from the different states in this House, yet we assist Mr Giscard d'Estaing by having a private, cosy little lunch at which half a dozen people will be present."
"Think again, Mr President, when these matters come up for debate and discussion."
"As regards enlargement, I very much welcome and support your initiative to invite representatives from the parliaments of the applicant states."
"That is good, right and proper."
"Let us have debate and discussion."
"One small word of caution: let us not overplay our role and move into an area where we might be overlapping the negotiating mandate of the Commission."
"We have to be careful and I would trust your experience and judgement in that."
"I speak from my own limited experience in that area, which I shall relate at another time and in another place."
"Finally, I support and commend your approach towards promoting external affairs."
"Might I ask you to look at the role of the parliamentary delegations in this particular area?"
"Are we doing Parliament justice?"
"Are we doing justice to anyone when we meet a delegation from India, say, or China once a year for one-and-a-half or two days?"
"Is that promoting foreign relations?"
"No, not in any shape or form."
"Why are we not, for instance, opening up discussions and debate with Iran at the present time?"
"If those advocating change within the Iranian regime need help and support through debates and discussions with people like us, why are not we giving them that?"
"Is it not about time we became masters of our own policy, our own approach, our own attitude in foreign affairs?"
"Mr President, you have made a great start."
"I warmly support you."
"I wish you well and I will be with you right along the way."
"The only modest correction I should make is that Mr Giscard d'Estaing will not be having lunch with the group chairmen."
"Today's meeting precedes the Convention, but I guarantee you that when the Convention starts and we know how it will be up and running we should insist on full accountability to Parliament on the floor of this House."
"Mr President, your speech today shows the value of the open election campaign."
"We have taken the time to discuss our own circumstances, and I should like to thank the President for his contribution and the discussion today, as well as table proposals for consideration."
"Consolidation of the laws could of course take place through our refusing to debate, or directly rejecting, proposals that are not consolidated."
"It cannot be sensible to accumulate 70 amendments in order to see how the law stands where fish are concerned."
"A reform in the interests of transparency should ensure that all meetings are open and all documents accessible, unless a qualified majority approves an exemption supported by reasons, of the kind we approved in the Martin/Bourlanges report."
"Political appointments must be a thing of the past."
"In future, everyone should be appointed and promoted according to their qualifications, here in Parliament too, and we could make a fresh start with those who are now to be appointed from the candidate countries."
"The plenary sittings must be turned into lively occasions."
"A third of the time could be set aside for spontaneous debate, as you intimated."
"Those active in Parliament must have the opportunity to tackle the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council if they do not receive answers."
"All MEPs must be permitted to speak at least three times a year."
"The number of votes must be cut back so that we are only voting on political differences."
"After each debate, the coordinators should meet and make the technical preparations for the voting."
"Details of the voting list should be known at least a week before voting takes place so that we can all consult our electorates and be aware of what we are voting on."
"The way in which posts are distributed should be revised."
"The d' Hondt method could be replaced by the Saint Laguë method in which the distribution is on the basis of 1,3,5 instead of 1,2,3,4,5."
"It would provide the same proportionate distribution, but it would make it possible for the smaller groups not always to have to take what the large groups leave aside and, in cases where the small groups are not represented, they could be appointed as observers."
"The independent Members should have their quota of opportunities, and we should ourselves remove all forms of discrimination instead of risking new legal proceedings."
"The Corbett report' s attack on the small political groups should be replaced by a gentlemen' s agreement through which we achieve some of Mr Corbett's objectives without reducing the groups' rights."
"In the Convention, majorities and minorities must have the same access to qualified aid and be able to put forward, and campaign for, proposals in the same way."
"There cannot be special rights for specific positions."
"The European Movement and the federalists do not have a sole and exclusive right to organise the debate with civil society using Parliament' s money."
"We must join in getting the whole of Parliament and the Convention to operate in such a way that all Members representing all positions feel they are being treated properly and on an equal basis."
"Today at the meeting with Mr Giscard d' Estaing, we must make a point of ensuring that all alternates in the Convention are given full rights of participation in the work."
"Good luck with the reform work!"
"Mr President, you have called for a more democratic and less bureaucratic Parliament."
"I see this as an important concept, and so I would like to start with the situation of the Unattached Members, the 33 truly second-class Members who do not have access to the d' Hondt system which is used to distribute everything in this House, who are not entitled to table documents or amendments and who are forced to admit even to their electorate that they are unable to play a full part in the Parliament' s work."
"There is a report which has been at a standstill for two years in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs; moreover a judgement was returned a few months ago by the Court of Justice which raised a number of important points in terms of whether those measures were appropriate or did not need to be amended, or whether legal penalties should not be imposed for failure to apply them."
"Mr President, I call upon you to pursue this matter and to revitalise that aspect of the work of this House, for I feel that, precisely with regard to the goal you mentioned, one of the problems facing us is not just the general, essential need to make our working methods more democratic and to ensure greater participation by all the Members, but also to take into consideration the second-class status of the Unattached Members which is endorsed and still confirmed in this House."
"From this point of view, Mr President, as has already been said, the Corbett report not only fails to provide an adequate response but is also, in a number of respects, a caricature of what should be an endeavour to improve our conditions."
"How could one possibly envisage - the Members may not be aware of this, but Mr Corbett did make this suggestion - doing away with topical and urgent debates, which are one of Parliament' s opportunities for real political debate, as President Cox said?"
"At this point, we might just as well do away with the resolutions at the end of political debates as well and, that way, we will become even more of a machine for voting on reports."
"I feel that this is not the right direction to take and, in this connection, I genuinely hope that the political groups, the Members and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs itself will carefully reconsider this suggestion, which is not a good one."
"Mr President, we need a Parliament whose work is better structured."
"When we have major debates, attended by members of the Commission or the Council but where only 10 or 15 Members of this House are present, it does not reflect well on Parliament. Parliament is not doing itself any service."
"Then, two hours later, maybe, this House becomes a sort of voting chamber, not least because, as we know, the existence of a certain penalty system makes it convenient to come here and vote."
"We used to have explanations of vote and a system which made debates visible and comprehensible for journalists and the public."
"That is no longer the case."
"The other point concerns publishing our debates."
"Mr Collins has raised this point and the other Unattached Members agree with him."
"Even today, for example, this meeting could have been organised in such a way that everyone participated or it could even have been transmitted over the internal system."
"I feel, and it is our deep conviction, Mr President, that, just as your election was broadcast over the Internet - and this was a major step forward - in this age of the Internet, both committee and plenary debates can and should be broadcast to give all the citizens, not just the European citizens, access to our work."
"Lastly, a word on the subject of the statute, Mr President."
"The statute is important, but it must also include Members' prerogatives; in other words, it must not be a statute centred solely on the financial side of being a Member of Parliament."
"I feel that the challenge facing us is to produce a Statute that definitively defines and establishes MEPs' status, their responsibilities, their prerogatives and their rights in respect of the institutions preparing for enlargement."
"I wish you every success in your work in this area, Mr President, and I hope that major reforms will be achieved under your presidency before 2004."
"I wish to begin by congratulating you on the state-of-the-European-Parliament address, which perhaps, like other state-of-the-Union addresses, should become an annual event."
"I personally think you have made a very positive start as President of the European Parliament."
"If we are to carry out the reform agenda that you have discussed, then we need an esprit de corps in this House."
"The way in which you have engaged the Bureau of Parliament, the Conference of Presidents, the committee chairs in your agenda, already in your first month, shows a determination to work across the whole of this House in order to deliver reform, and that is very encouraging."
"But, at the same time, you have also done the same with the institutions."
"Although we should not overstate these things, there is already an improved relationship between the Commission and the Council and this institution - and, perhaps most importantly - you have shown a willingness to take tough decisions."
"That is something which, I am afraid, will become more and more a feature of your presidency, but we will have more and more occasion to take hard decisions."
"If I have any criticism of your speech, it was not in terms of the content - there was hardly a word I disagreed with - but that I perhaps detected an element of ""mission creep"" in your speech."
"If you try to do everything, you may end up not succeeding in doing very much."
"I would encourage you to stick to just two or three key items: enlargement being the vital one; the internal reform of this House being the second; and also, as others have said, the communication strategy of this House to connect better with the citizens of the European Union."
"If you achieve progress in these three areas, you will have achieved very much indeed."
"Your speech also correctly got to the dilemma that we face."
"If we are to improve our standing as an institution, then we have to reform internally."
"That means a little navel-gazing."
"However, if we spend two-and-a-half years navel-gazing, then we will be even further away from the citizens out there."
"So we have to combine the two."
"We have to conduct reform within the structures of this House while on the floor of this House, as you rightly say, connecting with the citizens by discussing the major items that face them in their daily lives - to actually talk about the issues that matter out there, not the issues that matter in here."
"It is out there that really matters to us."
"Mr Dell'Alba made a point I had wanted to make."
"When you talked about inviting the members of the applicant countries' parliaments to be present at the enlargement debate here, I agreed with you, but my immediate reaction was to wonder where were they going to sit."
"Then I looked around the Chamber and realised that there would be no problem in finding seats for them in this House."
"There we have a double dilemma: one that you have identified, which is to make our debates more lively and interesting; but another one, which we have tried in the past to solve and need to try again: to make this plenary the focus of our four days' work in Strasbourg."
"There is plenty of other time for committee and delegation meetings, and for meeting lobbyists, etc., but when we are in Strasbourg, the plenary should be the centre-point of our activities."
"In fact, for most Members it is a side-show when they come to Strasbourg; the average Member spends less than five hours in this Chamber during a Strasbourg week."
"It should be where they are most of the time; it should be the focus of our activity; you should feel that if you have not been present at the plenary, you have missed out on something."
"Instead, sometimes you feel that when you have been in the plenary you have missed out on something that has been going on elsewhere."
"So we have to refocus to make this the centre of activity: a livelier Chamber where we really discuss the day-to-day issues."
"One last but important point, because both you, Mr President, and Mr Poettering in different ways referred to it."
"I welcome the decision on the von Wogau report - it was a right decision."
"But I do not believe, as you indicated, that better regulation or the long-term solution to what Mr von Wogau was dealing with in the Lamfalussy proposals can be left to the Convention."
"We have to focus on that in the next two or three months because the June Summit will deal with governance and better regulation, and it may be, if we do not focus on that now, that by the time we get to the Convention the pass will have been sold in June, so it is important that we look at this issue now and do not think that von Wogau was even a five- or six-month solution."
"It was a short two- or three-month solution to a very important point in terms of the powers of Parliament."
"Thank you very much and, again, congratulations on the progress you have made so far."
"Please be assured that, as I mentioned in the speech, I want to work between now and the Barcelona Summit to put together the interinstitutional working group or at least to be able to engage in that dialogue."
"The Spanish Prime Minister has already subscribed to that idea before this House."
"The Commission presidency has also backed the idea."
"We need to lock it down."
"You are perfectly correct: it is not something to be left for the medium term."
"But its agenda is one that will carry us over a number of other major hurdles."
"Mr President, I should like to start with a little irreverence which only your Irish colleagues can take the liberty of doing."
"As I address you, it is a great pleasure for all of us to move from the era of Paddy the Irishman to Paddy the President."
"In your own area of Cork in Ireland they would be tickled pink to think that we were discussing the feminine side of Pat Cox in Parliament this morning."
"But it is right that we should."
"I concur with Mr Collins."
"But there would be some amusement in some of the more rural parts of Ireland at the tone of the debate."
"I thank you for your contribution this morning."
"I thoroughly support your plan, as you have laid it before us."
"More importantly, thank you for addressing us in a language that was devoid of Eurospeak."
"One of the great problems in all the European institutions is that we have developed a language, a glossary of terminology that has created a barrier between ourselves and the people of Europe we represent."
"We have created that barrier not just between the people but between ourselves and the media, on whom we depend to sell our message to the people of Europe."
"Your contribution this morning was devoid of Eurospeak."
"For that I warmly congratulate you."
"It is important that we all follow suit - from the technical end to us as parliamentarians - as we express ourselves."
"May your enthusiasm not wane for the next two-and-a-half years and may it prove to be infectious as you represent us throughout Europe and indeed further afield."
"May your affection and obvious love of this Parliament, of these European institutions prove to be infectious as you address gatherings throughout your term in office."
"May it be particularly infectious in our country of Ireland as we endeavour to awaken from their slumber, from their indifference the 65% of the Irish electorate who failed to turn out to vote for the Nice Treaty last June, as we yet again try to offer them the opportunity to endorse enlargement of Europe between now and the end of December this year."
"It is most important that we enthuse our peoples and - top of your agenda - enthuse the Irish people for the enlargement project which we all support."
"I wish you good health and Godspeed for the next two-and-a-half years."
"Mr President, I shall keep it very brief."
"I am delighted that you have emphasised the 'primacy of politics' ."
"In the final analysis, this Parliament has grown from a paper tiger into a watchdog of democracy, and that is down to politics."
"In my view, communication and information are crucial in this connection."
"Information more so than communication."
"They are not the same."
"Communication is about bringing news."
"Information implies a dialogue with those to whom the information is directed."
"The dialogue must be open and objective, and should not degenerate into indoctrination and propaganda but should comprise communication and information."
"Sound information means that one has to present something of substance, that one has something to offer or something that one can pass on."
"It need not be perfect, but a dialogue is necessary to make any improvements."
"How will we deal with this?"
"There are countless reports on this subject."
"I myself had the honour of being the author of one of the many that are stored in the dark recesses of this institution."
"There have been many reports, yet little has changed in the many years I have been in this Parliament."
"How will we tackle this?"
"Could I make a suggestion, as we have tried all manner of things?"
"Why do we not hold an open debate?"
"You as representative of Parliament, along with those you select, you on behalf of Parliament along with the representatives of the media."
"Not with the intention to indoctrinate."
"I know how anxious the media is about propaganda, and with good reason. But simply an open dialogue to examine together how we can best serve the parliamentary, democratic culture, and hence Europe, a democratic Europe, for this is what is at stake in the final analysis."
"Mr President, I wish to say first of all that your work programme is also ours and that really your ambitions are also ours, and I am sure you will have the support of the House."
"I wish to make three distinct observations."
"Mr President, you spoke of a realistic and intelligent defence of the prerogatives of this House; you mentioned the Lamfalussy report; also, yesterday you decided not to attend the Court of Justice and to adopt a long-sighted approach on a matter vital to Europe' s citizens."
"I would say that this intelligent defence of our prerogatives - which are not our own, but which represent our responsibility towards the citizens - is a leitmotif that I wish to highlight."
"Within this defence of our prerogatives and this maintaining of better relations with the other two institutions, in which we all have an interest, there is, nevertheless, one aspect that you touched on briefly and on which I should like to focus: access to the 'screening' documents for the candidate countries which, to date, are being denied us."
"It makes no sense for us to ask our colleagues from the candidate countries to familiarise themselves with these 'screening' documents, whilst we ourselves do not have access to them."
"This is one of the practical issues, which should not simply be of concern to us, but which we should attend to immediately."
"The second aspect concerning this Parliament' s prerogatives is image."
"One image reveals more than a thousand words and the press conference held yesterday by the three institutions, together with the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, will mean that, in future, we will not have to read, as has happened before, that a directive has been approved, when what has really been approved is a Council common position."
"The three institutions are committed to demonstrating responsibility towards the citizens to produce effective and good legislation."
"Which leads to the second aspect: the insistence on the rigour of this institution is important."
"The three institutions have to improve the quality of legislation."
"This has been said on various occasions and is one of the great challenges overall, not just for the European institutions."
"Legislation must be legible despite its complexity."
"We must eschew jargon and unintelligible expressions, as has been said."
"To this end, when it comes to reforming this House, I wish to point out that this is a House of committees."
"We must support your idea - expressed, amongst others, by the Provan group and by other working parties within Parliament' s Bureau - that the more technical work must be carried out by the committees, but without its visibility to the citizens suffering."
"It is important that the citizens understand the work we are undertaking, not only in Plenary, which is already happening, but also in the committees."
"This is why we have to improve the committee' s system of communication with our citizens."
"I shall finish by discussing a third aspect, which is dialogue with the citizens."
"Mr President, you are a magnificent representative of what this House stands for."
"Your personal skills will ensure that we are able to undertake a useful piece of work."
"I use this word carefully: we have worked constructively on European integration, on what the European institutions really do, on what this House does and on to what extent we in this House feel responsible for the extremely important task of representing Europe' s citizens."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate you on an excellent start to your presidency."
"This debate has shown that there is much support and much appetite in this House for reform, in this lively exchange we are having in the catch-the-eye procedure at the end of this debate."
"You were kind enough to refer to my own report, which hopefully will be on the agenda at the next part-session."
"We are building quite a broad consensus on the bulk of the proposals contained in my report."
"In the last few days many groups have been kind enough to invite me to address their meetings and to engage in building this consensus."
"I am now quite confident that there will be a majority next month in favour of a useful package of reforms that will not solve all our problems - far from it - but will be a useful step forward."
"To those colleagues who feared that there may be elements of my report which are unfavourable to the smaller groups, I would like to reassure them."
"There is nothing that significantly undermines the position of the smaller groups in my report."
"If they continue to have fears, I shall be very happy to meet them to try to find a solution to any issue they wish to raise."
"My preferred solution is to persuade them, but I am open to other solutions if we can find them."
"This will be a useful part of the reform process and I thank you very much for your support."
"Mr President, on a point of order: I just wanted to engage in 30 seconds of navel-gazing."
"I agree with everything that has been said about reform."
"But when we talk about reform, let us not forget the conditions in which backbench MEPs work in this House."
"David Martin reproached us for not spending more time in the Chamber, but one of the problems is the amount of time we waste getting to this place."
"I will not relaunch that debate, but anyone looking at this splendid Chamber and the palatial public spaces of this building would not believe the cramped conditions in which a backbench MEP works."
"Please do not forget, you important people who have spacious offices - even the secretaries-general of the political groups have office space four times that of a backbench MEP - that when you have an assistant and a stagiaire crammed into one office, you have no place in which to meet visitors."
"Mr President, will you at least pledge to back us in getting computers for MEPs, preferably flat-screen computers so we can fit them on to our desks in our tiny offices and be more efficient for the 21st century?"
"I am sorry to raise such a brass-tacks issue: I know parliamentarians are always shy about raising the matter of their own working conditions but, frankly, unless we can be efficient in dealing with our work, we cannot deliver good service and present a good showcase to the world."
"I would not like people to look at the masses of space in the public areas and then come and see our little cramped offices, out of which we lose a third for a useless bathroom - but that is another matter."
"Please help us to be efficient, Mr President."
"The Bureau is looking at the technological aspect."
"I am sure we can do that."
"I am not sure what I can do as regards the buildings aspect, but you have my sympathy."
"Mr President, it is being stated that President Prodi took a position in a press conference yesterday on Commissioner Verheugen's behaviour in the Commission."
"This has to do with Stability Pact issues."
"Mr Verheugen is alleged to have assented in the Commission to the Commission's decisions, but then, last Sunday, to have dissociated himself from them in an interview with a German newspaper."
"I wish to ask you to give consideration to a procedure whereby we, that is, in Parliament or some appropriate forum, might hear an explanation of this from Mr Verheugen."
"That is my request, which I would like to make a matter of public record."
"I will check with the Commission as to whether the Commissioner is available to come to the House this week or, if not, on another appropriate occasion."
"Mr President, since Mr Poettering has raised this issue, I would remind him that, for the last six months, we have been waiting for Mr Bolkestein to speak to us, as we requested, on the remarks he made about Islam."
"I think that we must start at the beginning, because otherwise, only the Group of the European Popular Party will be able to raise these issues and I believe that we all have the right to have the Commission make a statement."
"As long as we make sure we are dealing with issues of political substance and not something else I am sure we can find a modus vivendi."
"I should like to thank everyone who has participated in today's debate."
"I should like to say in particular to the Commissioner and the Council present here that we are normally not so self-indulgent in terms of the time we take to talk to each other as colleagues."
"It is very important that in this House we work towards establishing an esprit de corps."
"It is very important that we work on this culture for change."
"If we do that I guarantee that the other two institutions will also benefit."
"I hope this has been time well spent for you too."
"The debate is closed."
"Combating terrorism"
"The next item is the joint debate:"
"Council statement - Decision taken on 27 December 2001 on measures to combat terrorism;"
"Report (A5-0003/2002) by Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism (14845/1/01 - C5-0680/2001 - 2001/0217(CNS))"
"and"
"on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States (14867/1/01 - C5-0675/2001 - 2001/0215(CNS))."
"Mr President, my report is a draft response by this Parliament to two legislative acts: a proposed Council framework directive on combating terrorism and a proposed Council framework directive on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States."
"Together with the creation of the European judicial authority, Eurojust, these two measures form the legislative basis of the European Union's response to the menace of terrorism."
"The European Union may allow itself a few moments of satisfaction."
"These measures represent a major step forward towards the creation of a European judicial space."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for reminding us that this judicial space did not start on 11 September last year, although it would be churlish not to recognise that the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September gave a political momentum which allowed us to knock heads together and overcome certain objections."
"Many of us regret that such a stimulus was needed."
"Nonetheless we welcome the progress it has brought."
"What do these measures do?"
"The European arrest warrant applies to a wider range of offences than previous extradition agreements."
"It makes surrender a judicial, rather than a political process."
"It largely abolishes the dual incrimination principle."
"It sets a time limit of 90 days for extradition, giving us the chance to judge all suspects of an offence at the same time."
"It consolidates the idea of European Union law."
"The framework decision on terrorism makes terrorism an offence in every country."
"Currently it has been an offence in only six."
"It defines for the first time in international law a terrorist act and the offences which constitute a terrorist act."
"It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties."
"I commend these measures to the House."
"The terrorist threat is deadly serious."
"It requires a serious response."
"These two measures constitute such a serious response."
"I regret - and we have in previous debates here regretted - the absence of proper democratic oversight and control of the Union's procedures of law-making in this area."
"This House argued for the invocation of Article 42 of the Treaty, allowing these measures to be brought within the first pillar."
"Nonetheless, we recognise that the process of debate has brought improvements, that our amendments at the first reading have introduced certain safeguards into these measures."
"I welcome the words from the President-in-Office of the Council about closer involvement of Parliament in the process of passing such legislation."
"Other measures, such as the freezing of assets, have been far less coordinated."
"Indeed, it is not unfair to say, from reports of Coreper meetings, that the European Union has been all at sea in its approach to freezing of assets and other decisions."
"The motion for a resolution on the table today reflects that."
"We know since the end of the 1990s that three phenomena - terrorism, internationally organised crime and corruption - are increasingly linked."
"What academics have called the terrorist criminal nexus is well established."
"The fight against the terrorist criminal infrastructure must be our top priority."
"We know, too, that internationally organised crime is by far the biggest factor, economically and probably politically, in this terrorist criminal nexus."
"Money laundering represents between 2 and 5% of aggregate global GNP."
"That is between EUR 500 billion and EUR 1.5 trillion."
"It is not enough just to freeze assets of terrorist groups."
"We must fight the economic dimension of terrorism if we are to get on top of the problem."
"The United Nations has started to do this through its financial action task force."
"The recommendations from the Washington meeting of 30 October to be implemented by June of this year are essential and provide an area where we can work together with the United States of America in combating this threat."
"But here I would appeal for the European Union to take the initiative: to take the initiative on ways forward, to try to bring the Americans back into the international community in this fight against terrorism, and to do so within a proper legal framework, with proper democratic and parliamentary control."
"A number of amendments have been submitted to my report."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 5 are identical and they cause me no problem."
"Amendment No 2 which comes subsequent to our adoption of the report in committee seems to be slightly out of context and I recommend a vote against."
"Amendment No 4 calls for the establishment of a European habeas corpus act."
"My group will support this, as we did in committee, although we consider the reintroduction of the amendment to be rather like adding too much monosodium glutamate to the cooking."
"But Amendment No 3 is the crux of the debate: the movers say that the European Union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law."
"That means that the Union cannot respond to the terrorist threat."
"I disagree with them."
"We must respond."
"But, in giving our agreement, we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be rebalanced with procedural guarantees."
"This matter is very poignant to me personally."
"Faith is not a comfortable basis on which to proceed in politics."
"I am aware that my name, and perhaps the name of my party, may be associated with laws that could be used for repressive purposes."
"I appeal to the Council and Commission, in the spirit of the new relationship that we have between our institutions, to move rapidly to consolidate the necessary move forward in security with measures to promote freedom and justice on which the European Union will be judged."
"In commending these framework directives to the House, in recommending that we trust the other institutions, I say to them: you are on trial."
"The European Union is on trial before the court of world democratic opinion."
"Mr President, if we can conclude this debate with a vote that confirms the broad consensus that we have reached to date on this matter, I wish to call on the parliamentary groups not to change the report."
"We will be renewing our commitment to the fight against terrorism and we will be ending a process which, as Mr de Miguel has reminded us, began in the European Parliament."
"By doing so, we would be turning one of the most illustrious pages in the history of this House."
"We now hope to see a rapid transposition of these measures so that they are effective, so that decisions are taken that are able to freeze the assets of European terrorist groups and so that efforts are coordinated in the fight against terrorism, not only between Member States, as has happened most notably between Spain and France in recent times, but also between the competent bodies that have been established within the European Union."
"Mr President, I am convinced that with this process, we will not only be responding to a demand expressed very firmly by Europe' s citizens, but we will also be making an invaluable contribution to the cause of freedom."
"There is no greater risk to the freedom of thought, of expression and to the right to life itself, than violence expressed through terrorism."
"Every democratic State has an obligation to provide justice with instruments such as those we are discussing today, which will make its work more effective."
"Under the Rule of Law, democratic dialogue must be based on mutual trust and non-violence, with the aim of defending democracy, precisely as we stated in one of the report' s sections on the Union' s role in the fight against terrorism."
"To do anything else, ladies and gentlemen, would be to accept that the laws approved by democratically-elected parliaments should change to please the murderers and for them to stop killing; this hope, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, should be rejected because it is antidemocratic and immoral."
"Mr President, the Council should realise that it is heading for a great row if it carries on as in its complex package of 27 December, making legal definitions of who is a terrorist without any democratic scrutiny."
"I predict that the Council's next step will be to institute Europe-wide bans."
"It would be outrageous to do that in secret and without accountability."
"Turning to the framework decisions on combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant, my group will support them."
"For a normally sensible British journalist yesterday to say that Europe blindly, on the nod, is about to indulge in its own sinister overreach, really is over the top."
"My group will not vote to postpone the entry into force of the European arrest warrant until there are common minimum standards of procedural law."
"Urgent action to catch terrorists and criminals cannot be postponed, but the habeas corpus amendment drafted so deftly by Mr MacCormick is very worthwhile."
"However, high minimum standards are also urgently needed in parallel."
"It is a fiction to say that, since we all have excellent justice systems, mutual recognition is enough."
"I could highlight flaws in the system of my own country - for example we have the highest number in prison of any EU State - as well as flaws in other Member States."
"The Council, as well as MEPs, must welcome proposals that the Commission is preparing on achieving equivalence in criminal justice standards."
"If some of the people who now oppose the European arrest warrant - in particular those on the right, not least in my own country - also cry ""shock! horror!"" at what they might claim is harmonisation of criminal justice systems, they will be guilty of great hypocrisy."
"We need the European arrest warrant; we also need a programme of equivalence in common minimum high standards."
"Mr President, the issue of the European arrest warrant is really quite bizarre, not only because important issues remain vague, but also because Parliament lacks the courage to exact what it agrees to in substance."
"First of all, I should like to give you a random example of this lack of clarity."
"The Council has rightly pared down the Commission proposal, as a result of which a Member State can refuse to extradite someone if that person has not done anything wrong according to that country."
"I agree with this."
"Accordingly, a Dutch doctor who carries out an abortion on an Irish girl in the Netherlands does not face extradition to Ireland."
"However, could this doctor ever go on holiday to Ireland, or any other EU country, if Ireland requests extradition on the grounds of manslaughter?"
"This remains unclear, and a lack of clarity in criminal law leads to the sense of justice being eroded."
"I should now like to turn to the issue of parliamentary courage. Mr Watson, ever since the Di Lello report, this Parliament has been of the opinion 'that the Member States have to agree on common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law in order to guarantee a common level of protection of the constitutional right across the EU' ."
"Since the European arrest warrant has demonstrated the need to protect our citizens across the European Union, and we also have the tool to enforce this protection, then we must also have the courage to use it."
"And you need not be frightened."
"If the Council is just as dynamic and decisive in guaranteeing citizens' rights as it is in taking repressive measures, the European arrest warrant will not run into any delays."
"Certainly not now the Commission has presented a first version of the minimum standards, by means of which it has demonstrated that these are both necessary and possible."
"With regard to the definition of terrorism, my group adheres to a number of guarantees included in the recitals and the Council Declarations of 6 December, including the guarantee that nothing in this framework decision 'can be interpreted in such a way that people who exercise their constitutional right to free expression of opinion can be charged on terrorist grounds, even if they break the law in the process.'"
"But all good intentions to adopt this text have been seriously hampered by the fact that these guarantees are not included in the Council Decisions of 27 December."
"The essence of the definition in this text is identical, but the guarantees have disappeared."
"They are not even referred to."
"Our amendment to the resolution aims to plug this loophole and, since only time will tell whether I am unnecessarily distrustful or justifiably cautious, I would ask the other groups to give my group this assurance."
"Mr President, for a second time, we are rejecting a text which forms part of a campaign conducted by the Bush Administration and which, in the name of the fight against terrorism, merely seeks to place the most basic democratic freedoms in jeopardy throughout the world, with total disregard for international conventions."
"To illustrate this, there are still, because of 11 September, 500 immigrants in the United States who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities, are being secretly detained and have never been charged."
"Military proceedings have been instigated."
"And, several dozen prisoners are now being detained in appalling conditions, at the Guantanamo Bay military base, who have no guarantees and no status."
"Here in Parliament, we have been made to endorse a list of terrorists, which was, in fact, drawn up by the CIA on the basis of its own criteria and without justification, whilst England, France and Italy are taking measures to curb freedoms, particularly those of immigrants."
"Furthermore, we have had a common definition of terrorism thrust upon us, one that is destructive of freedom and which, if applied to the letter by a leader like Mr Berlusconi, could lead to trade union activities, such as strikes within the public services, being classified as crimes."
"The last point I will add is that we do not fight the terrorism of private individuals by supporting terrorism engaged in by a State, as is the case with Mr Sharon - we do so by eradicating poverty, injustice and corruption from the globe."
"Mr President, I have just returned from Porto Alegre, and I understand the concerns of Mr Bush and his allies in the face of this huge movement that is fighting rampant globalisation."
"I, however, have chosen the camp I support;"
"I reject a campaign that seeks to criminalise any movement that challenges the established order."
"Mr President, I sympathise both with the previous speaker and with all those who, as frequently happens, mention - albeit, in my opinion, inappropriately in some cases - the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi."
"To get back to the debate, the European Parliament is, at last, going to vote on two fundamental issues: combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant."
"Of course, this vote is only a sort of belated attempt to comply with bureaucratic procedures in respect of decisions which have actually already been taken."
"As has already been stressed, this way of going about things is not particularly acceptable, for it represents a genuine political humiliation for the European Parliament, which - and we must not forget it - is the only democratically-elected European institution, the only institution which fully represents the European citizens."
"We can be satisfied with the endorsement of the European arrest warrant, a tool which will certainly be effective in legal terms in combating terrorism and international organised crime, replacing the complex, excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures."
"However, we must not forget that the fight against terrorism, particularly the sort of terrorism which we have encountered in recent months, cannot be conducted solely by means of arrest warrants, for this would be a hypocritical and wholly inadequate approach."
"As Mr Solana stressed yesterday, Europe will only be able to attempt to win genuine international credibility if it is capable of restoring peace and social and political justice to the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East."
"Europe' s undertaking in these critical areas must not be dictated solely by emergencies and emotion or, even worse, by the selfish desires of those who see their own peace threatened: it must be part of a European project, a practical, ongoing undertaking seeking to secure a fitting economic, political and social future for these areas."
"In conclusion, we are confident that the new constituent phase which will be inaugurated with the installation and work of the Convention will genuinely succeed in making Europe a strong, responsible political actor, capable of achieving a single common foreign and security policy and a common European area of freedom and justice."
"Thank you, Mr President, the date of 11 September has made it even clearer that a tough battle against terrorism and organised crime is what is needed in order to guarantee the free area of peace and security in the Member States."
"Via the present proposals, the Council is making a commendable effort to contribute to this by making rapid extradition possible."
"However, I do have some concerns."
"In my view, a restricted, positive list of criminal offences should fall under the European arrest warrant."
"The criterion is whether there is a European or international definition, as in the case of terrorism, for example."
"However, the list which is now before the Council contains many criminal offences for which there are no European definitions available."
"The nature of the listed offences is diverse."
"They cover fraud, rape and manslaughter."
"What is the cross-border aspect of these offences?"
"Do the existing extradition treaties not offer sufficient scope in this area?"
"However, in order to prevent this welcome initiative from being shelved again, now that a difficult compromise has been struck, I would give it the benefit of doubt."
"Mr President, we need to strengthen control at the European Union' s external borders if we want to combat the menace of terrorism effectively."
"I would point out that there is an undertaking made by the Ministers, which commits the Strategic Committee on Immigration to implementing measures such as the joint training of border control officials through the creation of a European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control."
"In this connection, we have firmly condemned the activities of a country which is hoping to accede to the Union, Turkey."
"People continue to arrive in Italy illegally by boat and Turkey must assume its responsibilities: the international authority has drawn up a list of what are known as 'rogue States' , but I would like to stress the responsibility of the 'Mafia States' too, which are making no effort at all to curb this appalling trafficking of people dragged into situations where there is no hope and which have no end."
"With regard to the arrest warrant, I must point out that the Italian Government has endeavoured to ensure that this framework decision cannot be enforced until the Constitution has been amended."
"Indeed, we need to consider two different requirements simultaneously: the security of the European citizens in the face of severe terrorist threats and the safeguarding of Constitutional freedoms and guarantees - fundamental, inviolable rights - whose sanctity must be defended in the face of all rules, including those of international law."
"Mr President, Commissioner, esteemed Presidency of the Council, I take a very positive view of the commitment brought, formerly by the Belgian Presidency and now by the Spanish, to this great issue of combating terrorism."
"The added value of this European Union of ours was also shown by the speed with which the European institutions, in particular the Commission and the Council, responded to the terrorist attack on 11 September with a whole package of measures ranging from the definition of the common offence via the European arrest warrant, to facilities such as joint investigation teams in Europol."
"This is a very positive response."
"What is, however, highly problematic about certain areas of this decision-making process is the circumvention of Parliament - of Parliament, which represents the citizens of our European Union and the involvement of which is required by law and Treaty, indeed it must be involved prior to a resolution of the Council rather than afterwards."
"As this is not the first time this has happened, and since there seems to be method in this approach, I would like to take this opportunity to protest in strong terms."
"Such modes of action involving circumvention of the Treaty should no longer be tolerated."
"I wish to add to this the demand that Parliament be in future more involved in the adoption of third pillar measures."
"The Regulation of 27 December stipulated the persons and groups whose accounts were to be frozen."
"I would be interested to know whether there is a report evaluating the success or otherwise of this operation, indicating which accounts were actually found and what funds were frozen."
"I would like to conclude by repeating my demand that Parliament should be involved in an effective way, as this would, on the one hand, enhance efficiency and, on the other, maintain legal certainty."
"Mr President, if any good came out of the events of 11 September - and it would be a brave person who said it did - I would single out two things."
"Firstly, it caused the world to look, for the first time perhaps, at the whole question of Islam as a religion - but I will leave that for the moment."
"Secondly, it caused Europe, the USA and the West to look again at the whole question of international relations."
"We cannot close our eyes and minds to the problems of small countries thousands of kilometres away or impoverished and troubled regions - whether or not we agree with the regimes there - and just think that they do not matter."
"If we do, we run the risk that the problems will manifest themselves on our doorsteps."
"One way that happens is through terrorism, which obviously we cannot ignore."
"We counter it by international cooperation."
"Mr Blokland said earlier that we need to be harder and firmer."
"In addition to repressive measures, it is fundamental that we look at and try to address the root causes - poverty, war, oppression and a whole range of issues - that lead to terrorism."
"We all abhor and condemn terrorism."
"These two reports are a first step towards greater international cooperation in addressing terrorism and increasing international police cooperation."
"We, as politicians, are elected to monitor at a European level what happens."
"We must press for the highest possible standards, for maximum cooperation, and constantly keep the situation under review and monitor progress."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to express both satisfaction and concern: satisfaction at the tangible step forwards taken by the European Community in terms of combating terrorism; concern at certain inappropriate compromises imposed by some Member States as a condition for them agreeing to endorse our Convention, compromises which we were not able to oppose before it was too late because Parliament was not consulted before the decisions were taken."
"The Italian situation is one example: our Italian citizens had to suffer humiliation and dissatisfaction on the part of the other Member States just because our government attempted, without success, to make the scope of the European Convention subject to certain conditions, excluding from it certain offences which are of great importance to our Prime Minister, who - by pure chance, as the State attorney for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borelli, would say - happens to be on trial in Italy for precisely these offences."
"I refer in particular to the offences of corruption and fraud."
"Failing in that attempt, our government had the gall to request, and this time obtained - a concession made purely to get out of the impasse - another misleading clause, which, in fact, is in danger of rendering the Convention on the European arrest warrant unenforceable in the foreseeable future."
"I refer to the clause to the effect that the government deems it necessary to amend the Italian Constitution in order to be able to implement the European rules."
"This is not the case: our Constitution does not need to be amended in any way; it provides all possible guarantees."
"My country can therefore now postpone indefinitely the introduction of a major instrument for fighting crime on the pretext that the Constitution has not yet been amended."
"I am aware that adopting the amendment we have proposed on this matter would be a superfluous gesture, but it would be the only way to make it clear that Parliament needs to be involved before decisions are taken, not afterwards."
"Mr President, all of us in this House are agreed that it is a good thing to move towards the creation of a common European judicial space."
"We are also agreed, particularly in respect of the arrest warrant, that it makes the adoption of common and high minimum standards a matter of urgency."
"Mr Watson and Mrs Terrón i Cusí have asked us today to take it on trust that it will be done as a matter of urgency."
"We have to take some things on trust, but I would be reluctant to take all on trust."
"Furthermore, standards alone are never enough because standards can be broken."
"The only thing that guarantees high standards being observed is effective remedies."
"One of the most effective remedies ever devised was devised by the English common lawyers - I speak as a Scotsman - in the way of making sure that those who are wrongly detained are brought to court and released if the jailer cannot show cause for keeping them there."
"That is a really effective remedy."
"In adopting the European arrest warrant each of our states makes its own judiciary the instrument of justice in another state."
"That is a good thing, that we help each other."
"But it should also be the case that if the powers of one country's courts are abused by misconduct of prosecutors in another country, they can be recalled with an effective remedy."
"An effective remedy must be a Europe-wide remedy and one that diminishes the risk of undue detention pre-trial like the old 110-day rule which we celebrate in my country."
"Let us have Amendment No 4 and make sure that we have remedies that are effective as well as standards that are high."
"Mr President, terrorists acts are now punishable in all EU countries, and it is already possible to extradite criminals from one EU Member State to another."
"That means that what is being proposed here is to some extent an empty gesture."
"It is clear, however, that it is in danger of weakening legal certainty."
"The proposal means that extradition cases would not be examined in the same way as before and that special legislation against crimes specifically classed as terrorism would be implemented on very vague and unclear grounds."
"I think it is dubious, on such vague bases, to have a special legal system within a legal system."
"We can now already see how people who ended up on the UN' s and EU' s terrorist lists have had their assets frozen without discovering why."
"As a result, they have no means of defending themselves, either."
"I believe that when, as we must, we combat terrorism, we must do so by employing, rather than weakening, the Rule of Law."
"Mr President, since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September of last year, we in the European Parliament have debated the threats to our freedom, democracy and values in a more realistic light than before."
"Most of us have realised that an attack on the United States is an attack on ourselves."
"Just a few months further on, however, there are circles that are busy relativising the threats by distancing Europe from the United States."
"None of us likes the restrictions and controls that hit all of us and limit everyone' s rights to freedom, but we have to accept them because we do not know where, and precisely who, the enemy is."
"We must, however, face the fact that until the divisions that divide the world economically, religiously and ideologically have been removed, it is impossible for us to bring about the area of peace, security and justice we want to see."
"While I shall vote in favour of the framework decision on combating terrorism, I shall abstain from voting in favour of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant since the latter has not appeared on the scene because of the terrorist threat but serves the overall purposes of federalism and is not limited to striking a blow against terrorists."
"In actual fact, I agree with Baroness Ludford that legal certainty is not, in all Member States, at a level that can justify such far-reaching surrender procedures as are at issue here."
"Mr President, this is one of the most illiberal and dishonest measures ever to come out of the EU, one with potentially enormous consequences."
"It has nothing to do with citizens' freedoms and rights, and everything to do with a monstrous power-grab by Brussels."
"In the book 1984 by George Orwell, the state ministries were given names which represented the exact opposite of their functions."
"Thus, the Ministry of Peace was concerned with war, the Ministry of Truth was responsible for propaganda, and so on. From this stemmed the term ""Orwellian inversion"", meaning a description which implies the opposite."
"How appropriate it is, therefore, that this measure should be approved by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - the ultimate Orwellian inversion."
"In approving this decision, the committee should be ashamed of itself and, if this so-called Parliament adopts that decision today, it too should be thoroughly ashamed."
"It will be betraying the very principles it claims to support."
"Mr President, I would like to tell the rapporteur that he is mistaken."
"We are the ones on trial: it is not the Council that is being put to the test today but Parliament."
"The Council has taken its decisions, and it took them in meetings held behind closed doors, in secret, decisions partially harmonising criminal law and criminal procedure."
"In particular, the European arrest warrant, whose scope is much wider than just terrorism, is an incentive to introduce heavy prison sentences."
"Above all, in automatically recognising the decisions and procedures of national penal systems, it fails to lay down any common minimum guarantee safeguarding the rights of the defendant."
"These are guarantees that Parliament cannot afford to hope will be put in place just for the future for it is its duty to demand them for the immediate present, to demand, that is - and here I am addressing Mr Pirker - that the procedures be respected rather than merely lamenting the fact that they have not been."
"Parliament must demand that, to safeguard the Rule of Law, no fundamental principles are jeopardised."
"Mr President, I am sorry that Graham Watson is not present, because I wish to begin by paying tribute to his work on these two reports, in his capacity as chairman of the Committee on Public Freedoms, Citizens' Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"As I have inherited this position, I feel, if possible, even more obliged to acknowledge the work that has been undertaken."
"I agree fully with what he has said, but with one important difference."
"We are talking about minimum guarantees of procedure as if there were none."
"There are, and although they are not common, which is the case in many areas, they are equivalent."
"They are also adequate for the time being."
"Not having - as European citizens who wish to establish a common area of justice - to become involved in discussing how to improve these guarantees is another matter altogether."
"We must make a clear distinction between the two issues."
"The Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with the Socialist Group, will vote against these amendments, not because we are against the issues, as some speakers have claimed, but because we must make it clear that all Member States have minimum guarantees of procedure which are adequate and equivalent."
"We must, therefore, act on the basis of this trust."
"We all want to be more ambitious for the future, however."
"The European Union flies the flag of human rights and guarantees and, therefore, when we establish this area of justice, we shall do so resolutely, in the committee that I chair and in this Parliament, as far as we can in this legislature."
"We will never consider it to be enough."
"Mr President, I think 11 September woke us all up and made us aware of the need for urgent action."
"I also believe that we have acted accordingly."
"I am myself from Germany."
"Germany, Spain and Great Britain are examples in the field of counter-terrorism, of which they have had experience."
"I think that is why we understand each other very well."
"It is also for this reason that Parliament has done its homework and always supported the Commission and the Council when they wanted to adopt reasonable measures and submitted sensible proposals."
"That has always, to date, been the way we have conducted ourselves."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, my problem is, though, that this is not just about combating terrorist organisations."
"It has also become clear since 11 September that the combating of terrorist groupings is not sufficient on its own."
"To take Islamic extremism in the European Union as an example, there are groupings that we do not describe as 'terrorist' but which our security agencies, for example, nonetheless categorise as organisations detrimental to security."
"In my country, Germany, there are 30 000 adherents of an Islamic grouping called Milli Görüs, or, in Berlin, 'Islamic Federation' ."
"As they enjoy the right to provide Islamic teaching in schools, and thus to engage in the brainwashing of small children, I see them as being in several respects at least as dangerous as the terrorist organisations."
"I therefore believe that an arrest warrant and a definition of terrorism cannot be enough on their own, and that it is precisely for this reason that we have to concern ourselves very intensively with the other causes of terrorism as well."
"I work on the assumption that the Commissioner and the Presidency, being from Spain, are in a position to examine this danger very closely."
"Mr President, the European arrest warrant that is before us is an unqualified political, legal and procedural sham."
"It is a procedural sham because the framework decision is already prepared and drafted."
"Everything was ratified at the Laeken Summit on 14 December 2001."
"The consultation of Parliament is therefore utterly illusory; it is worthless and I would even go as far as to say that it is insulting."
"It is also a sham in substance, because its original purpose was to combat terrorism following the attacks of 11 September."
"In reality, the scope of the future arrest warrant was widened to include 32 offences, which means two things."
"The first is that we are proposing to change from using a system of extradition between States, which guarantees individual freedoms, to a single legal system, without the representatives of the people being involved in this change."
"The second is that, on the pretext of combating terrorism, the European arrest warrant will provide the basis for cracking down on the convictions that are included on the list in question."
"In the future, for example, for having criticised an immigration policy that a judge supports, or for having declared one' s national preference in one' s country, or for having expressed an opinion that is deemed politically or historically incorrect, a patriot could be expelled from his country, arrested, and transferred to another country that has an unfamiliar language and legal system."
"What you are preparing is, in fact, not the Europe of security, which requires many other measures; you are preparing the Europe of uniformity, of power systems and of ready-made thinking."
"Big Brother is watching you."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr de Miguel for his statements today."
"The Watson report, which has recently been provoking extremely serious debates and has caused a number of clashes, is back on the table today."
"Today' s debate is on the amendments made by the Council after the decision was approved by Parliament; these amendments include those of the Italian Government, of course."
"My respect for Parliament prevents me from focusing on the controversy triggered off by a certain political party."
"The passage of time has proved these accusation to be nothing but hot air, hot air which, I regret to say, has been blown this way again today, thanks, not least, to Mr Di Pietro, on whose behalf, as a friend, I take it upon myself to apologise to the House, especially for his grossly inaccurate accusations which are more the product of blind hatred of the individual concerned than proven facts."
"The priority of internal security and the protecting external borders must therefore be underscored firmly once again."
"Internal security and the fight against organised crime can no longer be matters purely for national competence."
"The trafficking of drugs and human beings and terrorism are transnational phenomena which can only be addressed at a higher level."
"With regard to the need to create an internal judicial space, the differences between national Constitutions and judicial systems must be taken into account so that national legislation can be genuinely harmonised."
"The European arrest warrant must be accepted as an essential tool for combating terrorism and crime but, if it is to be genuinely effective, it needs to be handled in the same way in all the Member States."
"Only thus will the citizens be able to have guarantees of effectiveness in the fair handling of individual cases and the certainty of justice rather than the freedom and rights of the powerful - as somebody in this Chamber has insinuated - but the freedom and rights of all the citizens, including citizens of third countries who wish to live and work lawfully in Europe."
"We must fight to stop Europe becoming the new forum for attempts to exploit the legal system to persecute political figures or other forms of intolerance which diminish the dignity of the individual."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the battle against old and new forms of crime and unlawful activities, against organised crime, money laundering and corruption - combined with a bold fight against terrorism in all its forms - must not be confused with inquisition-like persecution."
"Henceforth, we must quickly build a common judicial space, maybe even placing the rules governing penal law under the first pillar again, making the different legal systems consistent and with the objective of combining inflexibility in fighting unlawful activities with firm consolidation of the Rule of Law."
"Mr President, we must never forget that our task here is to build, all together, a Europe based on the freedom of the citizens."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by reiterating the importance of this debate and of the piece of legislation that has brought us together today, because we have spoken so often of these matters that we sometimes run the risk of losing sight of how important the issues really are."
"I should, therefore, like us to be aware of the importance of what we are today deciding on, not only from the point of view of creating a common area of freedom, security and justice, but from the point of view of the political decisions that have led us to this agreement."
"In general, we tend to value things once we have lost them."
"I should like to value this decision - and I would ask you to do the same - for what we have lost as a result of not having taken this decision before."
"If ten years ago we had initiated the arrest warrant, if we had defined the crime of terrorism, if we had made European judges and police forces work together, if Europe had accepted ten years ago that defeating terrorism requires joint action and not only solidarity with those who directly suffer its blows and if we had confronted terrorism with the entire might of European democracy, today ETA would be a thing of the past."
"This is why I say I would like you to consider from this point of view the importance of the instruments that we are today debating and which we will be adopting."
"If we had introduced them before, we would not have suffered such irreparable losses."
"We have lost years of freedom and human lives and we have buried friends, dear friends, who would have been with us here today."
"History has shown that human beings can be extraordinarily cruel if their actions go unpunished."
"This is why I say that, if we had acted previously, ETA would today be a thing of the past."
"We would have fewer orphans, fewer widows, less suffering and less fear."
"Think about this when you vote, ladies and gentlemen."
"Be proud to be key players in this major decision and do not forget that, above and beyond all the speeches, what you are doing is giving life and freedom a chance."
"Mr President, this House is requested to give its approval to the proposal of the Council on a framework decision that concerns directly basic principles of democracy."
"This Parliament is merely consulted."
"Its opinion is, in the words of Mr Turco, ""no more than a costly bureaucratic exercise""."
"More than forty years have passed since I learned from Patrick McGuilligham at the Faculty of Law in Dublin what the expression ""rubber stamp parliament"" means."
"In our last sitting in Strasbourg, talking about the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty, the Spanish presidency put security first, ignoring the fact that the only real guarantee for security is the implementation of freedom and justice."
"Mr Watson, on that occasion, stood up to say: ""We will push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind."""
"Yesterday two more Basque organisations - SEGI and ASKATASUNA - were expelled from the area of freedom and justice in the name of Mr Aznar's priority - Spanish security."
"Can this judicial decision form part of the European judicial space mentioned by Mr Watson?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"The European Parliament' s renewed consultation about the framework decisions on the fight against terrorism and on the European arrest warrant bears the hallmarks of a diversion, although it presents the Dutch members of the PVDA in this Parliament with an opportunity to express our satisfaction with the result achieved in negotiations by the Dutch Minister in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council."
"Thanks to this result, an initially unacceptable proposal proved satisfactory after all, a compromise that is nothing to write home about in terms of content but that does secure the important achievements of our criminal law policy."
"Moreover, we do support the amendment relating to the European habeas corpus order."
"However, viewed in terms of the European Parliament' s relationship with the Council, this debate and subsequent vote actually constitute a mere show which compromises the credibility not only of Parliament but also of the Council."
"Every presidency pronounces touching words about the crucial dialogue with the European Parliament but, in this area, we have been taken for a ride twice."
"Firstly, Parliament was consulted about superseded proposals and, secondly, Parliament was allowed to have its say on completed proposals which were already set in stone."
"The vital new proposal on criminal procedural law seems to me to be a good opportunity to right this wrong and thus to better organise this dialogue."
"Mr President, today we have genuine reason to be pleased, because I am convinced that, with the approval, in a few minutes, of Mr Watson' s reports, we will be taking another important step towards the creation of the common European area of justice, freedom and security that we all wish to see."
"Another reason for this Parliament and, of course, for me personally, to be pleased, is the fact that the decisions adopted by the Council at the Laeken Summit take up the tenor of the positions that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions."
"I cannot however, approve the lack of sensitivity that the Council has shown towards Parliament - and this has been recognised by fellow Members and by the Council itself - with regard to consultation on the list approved on 27 December 2001."
"In achieving the difficult balance between freedom and security, a position in which we often find ourselves at the moment, we are taking the appropriate measures."
"We cannot postpone the approval of resolutions and democratic standards which protect democrats against the terrorists and against those who prevent the exercise of the democratic freedom of Europe' s citizens."
"At the same time, it is also our duty to acknowledge that we have a certain responsibility to continue to create this area of freedom and security, an aspect that some Members of this House have already put forward in various amendments."
"Sometime very soon, we will have to address these issues, but today is not the right time."
"Mr President, I too feel that, in adopting the Watson report, we will be taking a step forwards in the creation of that area of freedom, security and justice provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam and merely accelerated by the tragic attacks of 11 September."
"On the one hand, a common definition of terrorist offences is introduced, which has been greatly improved thanks precisely to the intervention of Parliament and which is necessary for the effectiveness of our undertaking in this field."
"On the other hand, not least in the area of criminal law, we are starting to implement the principle that Parliament has already upheld by unanimously adopting the Di Lello report on the mutual recognition of judicial measures when it came before Parliament, which is based on the assumption that all the Member States ensure minimum respect for fundamental rights."
"Here, we do not have the Guantanamo prisons but the supervision of the Strasbourg Court to safeguard human rights, although there is room for improvement in all our systems, of course."
"Thus, we are also bringing the effectiveness brought by joint action into play in the fight against terrorism, while still respecting the national diversities which make European integration unique."
"I regret to say that the slow progress of this integration means that the European Parliament is still in the situation where it is merely consulted by the Council."
"However, we can be confident that, once the Convention' s work and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference reforming the Treaties are over, this will no longer be the case, and that the Community method, which provides the greatest guarantee of democratic decision-making across the board, will be fully adopted in the Third Pillar too."
"Mr President, having heard all the speeches, the Presidency of the Council wishes to join in expressing its pleasure that today a major decision is being taken; the decision to approve these two Watson reports."
"I agree with the speakers who said that this is a great day."
"I would say that it represents a huge step forwards in the construction of this area of security, justice and freedom."
"Although it has been suggested that we could have done this sooner, the fact is that we are now, at least, on the way to achieving it."
"At the same time, I should like also to say, Mr President, in response to the words of some honourable Members of this Parliament, who expressed their concerns that the implementation of these decisions could endanger fundamental rights, human rights and the idea that every European country accepts the primacy of the Rule of Law, I should like to say that this primacy and the safeguard of these fundamental values and human rights are the foremost considerations of the Council and the Member States when implementing these antiterrorist measures."
"We are convinced - as I feel sure Parliament is - that the best way to combat the scourge of terrorism is precisely to do so on the basis of our system of values and with the law behind us."
"And also to fight resolutely, in order to safeguard this system of values, which terrorism wishes to ignore."
"I therefore wish, on behalf of the Council, to offer every guarantee that citizens' rights will never be violated by the implementation of the decisions taken by the Council, which are also supported by this Parliament in the two Watson reports."
"Mr President, Mr de Miguel, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased to be able to take part in today' s debate, which we consider politically important for the future of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We have, on several previous occasions, examined the legal configuration of the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on measures for combating terrorism in the light of the Watson report, which was adopted by Parliament on 5 September 2001."
"I would like to reiterate that the Commission was already working on these areas over a year ago, at the request of the Tampere European Council, and I think that Parliament can testify that the Commission treated this subject with the desired importance, so that negotiations could be completed by the deadline we were set by the Extraordinary European Council following the events of 11 September."
"Moreover, I would once again like to praise the efforts of the Belgian Presidency to achieve the results that are the subject of our debate today."
"The two texts before you are an important step in improving the ability of the European Union and the Member States to fight effectively against organised crime in general and against terrorism in particular."
"As we wished, the European arrest warrant will fully replace the extradition process throughout the European Union, something that had been requested by the Tampere European Council in October 1999, a request that was reiterated by the Extraordinary European Council of September 2001."
"I would also like to stress that, from the outset, the Tampere European Council not only advocated using the European arrest warrant to combat terrorism, but also to make the European arrest warrant an instrument that would replace the entire extradition procedure between Member States."
"The requirement of 'dual criminality' - under which the person accused can only be surrendered if the facts that motivated the issuing of an arrest warrant also constitute a crime in the Member State where the arrest warrant is to be executed - is abolished for 32 offences that are punishable by a term of at least three years' imprisonment in the Member State which issued the arrest warrant."
"This list effectively covers the most serious crimes and the largest part of these was taken from the Europol Convention, which was ratified by all the Member States, meaning that it was subject to the democratic vote of the national parliaments of the 15 Member States."
"The European arrest warrant will enable European magistrates to work directly together, with full independence and whilst fully observing fundamental rights."
"The administrative phase of the extradition procedure has been abolished, the political nature of the extradition procedure has been abolished, the procedure has been placed entirely under the authority of the magistrates and judges of the Member States, and I think that this plays a crucial part in strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice."
"As far as terrorism is concerned, the text will enable us to harmonise the definition of terrorist offences at Member State-level."
"The text defines terrorist offences in terms of specific acts, such as attacks upon a person' s life or upon the physical integrity of a person, kidnapping or hostage taking, causing extensive destruction to a government or public facility and seizure of aircraft, and also in terms of the aim pursued such as intimidating a population, destabilising the structures of a country or an international organisation, unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act."
"It also provides a definition of a terrorist group, which is inspired by the concept of a criminal organisation established by the Joint Action of 21 December 1998, and makes it a specific offence to direct a group and participate in a terrorist group."
"Furthermore, a mitigation mechanism provides for a system that aims to facilitate the cooperation of reformed terrorists with the police and judicial authorities."
"I would like to stress that this definition is particularly important, at a time when the European Union must speak with the same voice at the negotiations that are currently taking place at the United Nations in New York on the adoption of the international convention on global terrorism."
"We intended, however, to clarify some aspects of the text, particularly in the light of the many comments by MEPs."
"I hope that you will be pleased to see your views brought together by the text which was adopted by the Council, particularly those views regarding trade unions or anti-globalisation demonstrations."
"These activities cannot, under any circumstances, be classified as crimes by the framework decision, even when they do occasionally get out of hand."
"To claim that the aim of this instrument is to punish such demonstrations would be a purely popularity-seeking exercise."
"Everything is now perfectly clear and established in law."
"Furthermore, the Council will be issuing a recital and a statement to confirm that the framework decision will not apply to the behaviour of those who are acting in order to preserve or restore democratic values."
"As for the respect for fundamental rights, a subject that both Parliament and the Commission treat with particular attention, I believe that the two texts are satisfactory."
"Regarding the arrest warrant, it has been repeatedly reiterated, most notably in Article 1, that in the execution of a European arrest warrant, the Member States and judicial authorities must always ensure that they scrupulously observe the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty and that are reflected in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We have also confirmed that it is not possible to expel or extradite a person to a State where there is a serious risk of that person facing the death penalty, torture or other punishment or inhuman or degrading treatment."
"I would like to stress, and I understand Mr MacCormick' s concern on this issue, that your amendment may have the opposite effect."
"I am being very honest with you."
"I would like to point out that the habeas corpus amendment is contained in the legal system of each Member State and that, in addition, Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taken up by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, contain rules on the conditions governing detention and release, where the detention is unlawful."
"There is nothing in the European arrest warrant that derogates from the application of the provisions of the national legal system and the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the definition of conditions governing detention, which exist in the European Union Member States."
"The Commission hopes that these texts will be formally adopted in May at the latest, as soon as the Parliament' s final reservations have been dispelled."
"All the Member States must then adapt their national legislation so that the two texts can enter into force on 1 January 2004 for the European arrest warrant and 1 January 2003 for combating terrorism."
"The key to the success of the process initiated with the European arrest warrant will be mutual trust in independent and effective legal systems."
"That is why, as you advocated in several of the amendments tabled today, and as I announced the last time I came before the House to speak on this matter, the Commission will issue a communication this year on minimum procedural guarantees within the European Union."
"The first discussion document is already available electronically via the Commission' s web site and you can all access this document directly."
"The document will enable us to launch a public debate on these issues and to prepare the communication that the Commission will present before the end of the year."
"In this communication, we will tackle questions as diverse as the right to language assistance, legal assistance, the rules on appeal, the collection of evidence, and the issue of alternatives to provisional detention or decisions by default."
"Our medium-term objective is to propose a legislative instrument in this area, following the public debate."
"Mr President, I am still bearing in mind the prospect of implementing these texts within the framework of the enlargement of the European Union."
"The key to success in this area will also be mutual trust in independent, reliable and effective legal systems."
"People have accused European legal affairs of lagging behind for years."
"The two texts before you today are without doubt a major step forward and I am counting on the commitment of the Spanish Presidency and on the commitment and support of the European Parliament to pursue this ambitious integration."
"The message is clear."
"Violence is unlawful."
"We have the legal and legitimate tools to protect democracy because the urgent demand to provide security and to combat terrorism expressed by all European citizens is something we are taking seriously."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you Commissioner."
"After the Council statement, I received two motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m."
"Financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference (Monterrey (Mexico), 21/22 March 2002]."
"Mr President, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union is delighted to appear before Parliament to give details of the current state of preparations for the International Conference on Financing for Development, which is due to take place in Monterrey (Mexico), from 18 to 22 March."
"In recent months, the Monterrey Conference has come to occupy a prominent place on the so-called Development Agenda, particularly after the attacks of 11 September and with the realisation that the problems of development in a globalised world require our full, immediate and urgent attention."
"This widespread interest justifies the efforts made by everyone who attended the fourth meeting of the Conference' s Preparatory Committee, which has just been held in New York, and which concluded with the adoption of a text that will be submitted for the approval of the Heads of State and Government that are due to attend the Monterrey Summit."
"It is no accident that this document, which I shall discuss briefly a little later, is entitled ""The Monterrey Consensus"" ."
"Given that the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey is undoubtedly one of the most important events in the field of cooperation during our Presidency, Spain wishes to attach special priority to this event and this priority is reflected in the level of the official representation."
"By this I mean that the Community delegation to the Monterrey Summit will be led by the President of the Spanish Government, the President-in-Office of the European Council."
"The preparations for the Conference, Mr President, have been extraordinarily complex, given their exhaustive nature and the huge number of individuals that have been involved in the discussions."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank the previous Presidencies of the Union for the considerable effort they have made throughout this process, since it has been a gradual process to bring us up to the point we have now reached."
"This ongoing and joint effort now means that, in Monterrey, the European Union can play the leading role it deserves as the world' s major donor of official development aid."
"Before I highlight and discuss the features of the text adopted in New York, I should like, Mr President, to put the Monterrey Conference in the proper context, because it is not an isolated process. Instead, it is part of what was started by the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000, on sustainable development and the fight against world poverty."
"We are, therefore, facing three independent but closely related procedures."
"Firstly, trade, within the framework of the commitments adopted at the conference of the World Trade Organisation held in Doha."
"Secondly, everything that concerns the mobilisation of financial resources, the United Nations Conference on Financing for Development and, thirdly, in the field of the environment, the Conference on sustainable development that is planned to take place in Johannesburg in September of this year."
"I shall now refer briefly to the features of the Monterrey document, the famous Monterrey consensus that I mentioned earlier."
"This final text, adopted ad referendum, since a formal closing session could not be held in New York, consists of 73 numbered sections and reflects the spirit of consensus in which it was drawn up."
"Because it does not contain any unresolved elements, since everything has been agreed on, we hope that the Heads of State and Government will be able to maintain a genuine, frank and open political dialogue on the main issues that affect development and its current challenges."
"The agreement that has been concluded lays down that the fundamental pillars of international development cooperation are a series of principles shared by donors and beneficiaries and, in particular, the concept of good governance at all levels, the existence of solid democratic institutions and respect for the Rule of Law, all in the spirit of partnership, on the basis of which the developed States are committed to adopting a series of measures to make financing flows more flexible for developing countries - albeit with a set of conditions - enabling governments to use international cooperation to create domestic conditions favourable to economic growth and social development."
"Developed countries also assume the obligation of promoting trade within the terms of the agreements adopted in the World Trade Organisation, which are generally considered to be the main driving force behind all economic activity."
"The developed States, after overseeing a reduction of official development aid in recent years, are now committed to increasing it."
"This increase of resources is a commitment that applies to all donors, including the United States and Japan."
"The text adopted is in line with the Laeken Declaration and the entire document emphasises the private sector' s role as a driving force for development and as a source of resources."
"The text also takes up the need to increase resources to strengthen the institutional capacity of developing countries, and to implement the entire Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative."
"With regard to the international financial architecture, the autonomy of the existing institutions and the mandate of their boards of management will be upheld and support will be given to the process currently under way in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"At the same time, we will be insisting on the principles of coordination, of transparency and of the participation of the developing countries in the international financial institutions."
"The mechanisms for following up the Conference were also the subject of intense debate, with the decision finally going to various methods of follow-up, at the spring meeting of the Economic and Social Council, with the Bretton Woods Institutions and with the participation of the World Trade Organisation, also including representatives of civil society and the private sector, and with high-level dialogue in the United Nations General Assembly, held every two years."
"At the same time, within the United Nations, the Secretariat-General has been asked to support the full use of existing mechanisms for coordinating the specialist agencies of the United Nations and the drawing up of an annual report on the work achieved in this area."
"To this we can add a follow-up International Conference, whose concrete procedures will be defined by 2005."
"This set of instruments and these mechanisms are intended to ensure that the Monterrey Conference process remains on the agenda of the main international organisations and institutions, as well as in the fora of the United Nations, and of its specialised programmes and agencies."
"I would not wish to end, Mr President, without mentioning some of the contributions made by the European Union, that arise in the text on more than one occasion."
"The European Parliament must be very aware, and we must be proud, of the firm position that the European Union has maintained throughout this Monterrey process."
"I should like to list these contributions."
"Firstly, the concept of partnership and the insistence on the need for solid economic policies, good governance and democratic principles, and the defence of human rights."
"At the same time, the European Union has insisted on the participation of civil society in the development process."
"Secondly, I should like to highlight the European Union' s position of emphasising the need for development to be sustainable and to incorporate economic, social and environmental aspects, whilst respecting, in all cases, gender equality and holding the fight against poverty to be a fundamental objective."
"The Presidency, therefore, regrets that it was not possible to include a specific reference to the innovative concept of public goods on a global scale, in the face of opposition, to the very last, both from the Group of 77 and from other donors, although it hopes that, given its importance, the discussions on its definition and financing will continue in the appropriate fora."
"Thirdly, the European Union has sought to highlight the link between the effectiveness and efficiency of official development aid and the implementation, by the beneficiaries of aid, of appropriate policies in the political, economic and social fields."
"These are policies focused on giving aid to those in greatest need, so that maximum benefit can be gained from this official development aid."
"In this way, the emphasis is focused not only on increasing the volume of resources, but on its effective use, with the fight against corruption also playing a key role and, furthermore, the commitment to continue with negotiations on the specific United Nations convention applying to this issue."
"Similarly, external debt relief has been linked to the effective use of these resources to achieve economic growth and a sustained development that benefits the least-favoured sectors of each country taking part in these mechanisms."
"Naturally, the European Union has worked very actively with other major donors, such as the United States and Japan, and with the Group of 77, to achieve consensus on the objective of contributing 0.7% of GDP to development, which allows us to include the differing points of view, economic realities and sensitivities."
"I wish to emphasise that, precisely because of this work, a similar terminology has been used in the Monterrey consensus to that approved at the Laeken European Council."
"Fourthly, the European Union has made efforts, which have been crowned with success, to have explicit references included in the text on multilateral cooperation in light of the new transnational challenges and threats arising from the funding of terrorism and organised crime."
"My fifth point is that the European Union has also worked actively to have specific references included in this text to private-sector banking and to the importance of the development of this sector in supporting small and medium-sized businesses in developing countries."
"Lastly, the support measures to increase the institutional capacity of the developing countries in the field of trade should also be highlighted."
"For this reason, the Presidency sets great store by the package of practical measures that is being prepared by the competent services of the Commission, to increase developing countries' negotiating power in the field of trade."
"To sum up, following the fourth and last preparatory meeting, the Presidency is quite optimistic about the forthcoming Monterrey Conference."
"Despite the doubts that remained up until the last moment, we were able to adopt a final text on 27 January, almost two months before this important international meeting."
"The fact that this was achieved by consensus - as I have already mentioned - and that we managed to involve all the donors in this consensus, makes the Monterrey consensus a good platform for the future, because it is creating the climate of trust that this complex process requires and which, furthermore, now means that the round tables planned for Monterrey can take place in an atmosphere that is positive and constructive and not one of confrontation."
"The Monterrey Conference needs to be an innovative event, by tackling development and the fight against poverty from an all-encompassing position, covering the various aspects and encouraging the participation of all players."
"This global vision gives the process as a whole an extraordinary complexity, which we must also tackle pragmatically and realistically, by means of work that makes inclusion - and not exclusion - the main objective of all those who are committed to cooperation development tasks."
"We hope that the international campaign that is announced in Article 62 of the document, as one of the Millennium objectives, will also contribute to this."
"Mr President, I can ensure this Parliament that the Council Presidency remains firmly committed to this approach and that the success of the Conference is still our main objective, especially if we take account of the fact that development cooperation policy must be one of the pillars on which the European Union' s external action is based, and must be in perfect harmony with other pillars such as the external and common security policies and trade policy."
"For this reason, we are sure that the Monterrey Conference offers us an historic opportunity for the European Union to be able to project and transmit, together with the rest of the participants in that event, a clear message in defence of the values we hold dear."
"Therefore, we consider that the defence of the democracy, of good governance, of strengthening the institutional development of aid-receiving countries, the Rule of Law, peace and security, and human rights, are crucial elements of economic and social development as a whole."
"Mr President, the EU attaches great importance to the Conference."
"We are convinced that in the current international context, we cannot approach the Financing for Development Conference on a business-as-usual basis: this time we need concrete action."
"The present crisis will impact on economic development worldwide and it will be once again the poorest who pay the highest price."
"We must counter this tendency by trying our best to make globalisation work for the poor and not against the poor."
"In this context, the Financing for Development Conference represents a key opportunity for the international community to enter into a new ""global deal"" on the assumption that a safer world for all will only be possible if there is a strong signal on the renewed commitment in the fight against poverty."
"After the agreement reached in the Preparatory Committee on the final document for the Conference, we should focus our attention on positive initiatives that the EU could make in key areas and on the input we can make in the political declaration in Monterrey."
"Action is needed on the volume of ODA: we have to agree on concrete steps to double ODA flows within the next five years, in order to be able to achieve the Millennium development goals."
"ODA must also be more efficient: we have to complete work on the untying of aid in time for the Conference."
"All the themes discussed internationally will remain on the international agenda, whether or not they are specifically included in the Monterrey consensus."
"One such case is the discussion on global public goods."
"We will continue arguing in order to give some real impetus to international solidarity."
"In our view, Monterrey and Johannesburg are closely linked, as both look at ways and means to implement the Millennium Declaration and the International Development targets, which we strongly support."
"Also they are both related to the trade negotiations following the launch of these in Doha."
"We have an opportunity to work in a comprehensive manner and we look forward to taking part in the conference and making it a success."
"Mr President, we live in a world characterised by great material wealth, but the wealth is unevenly distributed."
"At present, more than three billion people are trying to survive on less than two dollars per day."
"Eradicating poverty is a moral imperative, but it is also an issue directly linked to our common security."
"We live in a world in which countries and people are increasingly interdependent, which is more divided and in which there is greater danger of tensions, large-scale migration, damage to the natural environment and increased crime."
"All this can of course also be linked to desperate acts that can lead, for example to terrorism."
"It is against this background that we must view not only the forthcoming conference in Monterrey, but also this autumn' s world summit in Johannesburg."
"On both occasions, rich and poor countries will have an opportunity to agree upon a long-term plan to eradicate poverty step by step."
"The rich nations must offer increased support."
"The poor nations must determine their priorities when it comes to work on combating poverty, greater respect for democracy and human rights and a more vigorous fight against corruption etc."
"I think the consensus document referred to here today is weak."
"No amount of fine words and eloquent rhetoric can eradicate poverty."
"The spirit of this resolution is therefore that the EU should make every conceivable effort in Monterrey to ensure that specific pledges are made on increased cooperation and transfers of resources, debt cancellation and generally increased aid in a range of areas."
"One particular issue is that of work designed to increase the production of the global, or 'public' , goods to which Commissioner Nielson refers, that is to say efforts to protect the climate, combat deforestation and develop vaccines and medicines to combat infectious diseases etc."
"Through this resolution, we are sending a clear signal to the Commission, to the governments of our Member States and to the international community that, as parliamentarians, we take these issues extremely seriously and desire more than merely words in Monterrey."
"We want to see practical results."
"Mr President, with the UN Conference in Monterrey around the corner, the world is facing a fundamental choice."
"Despite all the fine speeches, international conferences and development programmes, the gap between rich and poor has only widened over the past decades."
"1.2 billion people, that is one fifth of the world population, live on less than one dollar a day."
"The three richest people together own more than the total income of the world' s 48 poorest countries, and 130 million children never attend school."
"These are the bare facts."
"We all have a clear lesson to learn from the disastrous attacks of 11 September. In the Global Village, we have to be prepared to tackle these problems together, but our response falls extremely far short of the mark."
"I want to warn against a new international doctrine according to which the western world, having turned its back on these one billion people fighting for their daily existence, withdraws behind barriers made up of weapon shields and expensive technological defence materiel."
"The amount of USD 379 billion which, if it were up to President Bush, is being earmarked for the Pentagon next year is more than seven times the total amount of development aid spent last year worldwide."
"This situation is all the more poignant when one realises that, despite the worldwide agreement to spend 0.7% of GNP on development aid, the figure has even dropped to an all time low of 0.24%."
"This is unacceptable because it is precisely a doubling of the worldwide development aid figures that is required in order to meet our international pledge, namely that, by 2015, all children in the world will be able to attend school and receive medical care."
"The pledges for 2015 are clear."
"The Member States must now very quickly meet this 0.7% target in a practical way."
"We must not allow the breakthrough at Doha to be watered down."
"European agricultural policy must change to benefit the Third World."
"Without any serious commitments by the Western countries, the conference in Monterrey will end up in a stalemate."
"This is why Europe, as the world' s largest donor of development cooperation and as the largest international trading power, must be prepared to throw its weight into the balance, building on the successes achieved at Doha, with a view to reaching authentic binding agreements in Monterrey about aid, education, health care and far-reaching debt relief."
"Plugging the welfare gap is crucial for attaining stability and peace in the world."
"More development aid is not enough but, without extra funding, poverty cannot be eradicated."
"Affordable schooling and health care must enable people to develop the economy themselves and attract foreign capital."
"In order to achieve the UN development objectives, aid has to be doubled."
"Most donors still give far less than the agreed 0.7% of their GNP."
"America could easily contribute far more, but only has an eye for increasing its military expenditure."
"Many European partners too are still failing to meet the mark."
"The problems involved in granting aid should not be an excuse for doing too little."
"Learning from experience and improved international coordination can make development cooperation more effective."
"Aid must help set up good governance, democratic structures and a well-functioning market economy."
"Access to the global market is essential for developing countries."
"Insupportable debts must be substantially lowered, and the Debt Repayment Fund must be adequate for this."
"Poverty, Mr President, is the breeding ground for violence and terrorism."
"More aid is not only a humanitarian necessity, but also an absolute condition for attaining stability and peace in the world."
"Mr President, we must welcome the International Conference on Financing for Development, as this is an essential theme in the debate on reducing aid to developing countries."
"For more than 20 years, the UN has told donor countries that they must dedicate 0.7% of their GNP to state development aid, in accordance with OECD standards, but only four countries are respecting this commitment."
"Aid is decreasing in general and the current average is 0.2%."
"Developing countries are suffering badly from the gradual and structural deterioration in trade terms for basic products and are caught up in the vicious cycle of paying back often illegitimate debts, as well as the interest charged on them."
"How can we raise financial resources for the human, economic and social development of these people, given these circumstances?"
"Our hopes rest on Monterrey therefore, unless the outcome has already been determined and the American positions dominate this conference, as was the case at Doha."
"By faithfully following the liberal principles of development that the international institutions and the European Commission have been applying for 20 years, the document before us, just as the Monterrey consensus, never calls neo-liberal globalisation into question."
"However, the income of the population of developing countries has continued to fall over the same period, which proves this formula is ineffective and counter-productive."
"It is failing, but we carry on regardless."
"I do not know if the draft consensus for Monterrey, which does not propose any ambitious objectives, any practical financial measures or a timetable, is set in stone."
"If that is the case, and if the conference limits itself to making wonderful statements which will never be followed up, I think that we must cancel it and the millions of euro that have been earmarked to organise the conference must be given directly to the least-advanced countries."
"It would be a shame because there are grounds to condemn and criticise, but there are also grounds to discuss and, in relation to mobilising aid, propose cancelling debt, taxing capital and reforming the WTO."
"The European Union must seize this opportunity to push through the adoption of ambitious objectives as well as restrictive measures, which could enable poverty levels to be cut in half by 2015."
"The EU must reiterate the commitment made at Gothenburg to request the Member States to increase their aid to 0.7%."
"The governments and parliaments which agreed to the principle of a Tobin-type tax must demonstrate their interest in regulating the financial markets and redistributing wealth towards the south."
"Mr President, all those taking part in the summit must ensure that it is a success."
"The European Union has a responsibility to do this."
"Mr President, the situation of poverty in the world is perfectly well known, as is the deep gulf that separates the northern and southern hemispheres."
"Nevertheless, and despite several declarations of good intentions, the formal 1974 commitment to attain the objective of public aid for development at a level of 0.7% of GDP and despite the fact that the World Bank recently found it necessary to double the resources earmarked for public aid, the truth is that it is no higher than 0.22% in the OECD countries, the lowest level ever, having fallen by around 25% in the last decade and not currently exceeding 0.32% in the Member States of the European Union."
"Against this backdrop and with Johannesburg on the horizon, the Monterrey Conference is taking on an undeniable importance."
"It is truly time to reverse past actions and negative trends, to look at the problem of the development of poor countries in a different way, a way that demonstrates greater solidarity and to adopt practical and binding measures."
"We respect the Council decision of 8 November, but it is crucial that the Spanish Presidency and the Commission spare no effort to ensure that Monterrey results in objective and scheduled commitments that guarantee some progress, even with the awareness of the retrograde and unacceptable positions of the American administration in this field, which cannot impose conformist positions on others, and even with the awareness of the weaknesses of the so-called Monterrey consensus itself."
"Monterrey must also result in guidelines that put an end to the devastating effect of foreign debt on the development of developing countries, by putting forward mechanisms that do not hold back the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative and which are primarily founded on global recognition of the principle of debt relief."
"The appalling situation in which the developing countries find themselves cannot remain as it is and the European Union and its Member States must not only not content themselves with being the largest donor but must also adopt a clear position which helps these countries to find a way out of this situation."
"Mr President, the widening gap between the world's rich and poor represents an enormous potential risk to all concerned."
"Traditional development aid, which is taken more or less to be a sort of gift day in which the rich countries give to the poor ones, does not work."
"What we need is an all-embracing concept of the peaceful development of the poor countries."
"This is, of course, easier said than done, but we must remember that it is the countries with a wealth of raw materials, such as Angola or Nigeria, for example, whose people are the poorest."
"That is not by chance; there is a system behind it."
"We need to ask ourselves which, in this instance, are the donor countries and which the recipients - a question which, for me, has not been answered unambiguously."
"The position of the developing countries is worse than in the days of colonial rule."
"The key is fair world trade, in which raw materials have to be at the prices they deserve, and in which the net product must remain in these countries in order to develop their infrastructure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate is adjourned."
"It will be resumed this afternoon."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 12.25 p.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, given that today is the 50th anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty the Queen to the throne of the United Kingdom, could we not make a special note of that and send her felicitations and congratulations on fifty years of a glorious reign?"
"I will pass on your remarks to the President."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I should like to notify you that, at any rate, it is still possible to vote on the second part of Amendment No 1."
"In terms of words, you are probably right, but the spirit of the amendment is in contradiction."
"So I would ask the rapporteur, Mr Olsson, for his advice on this matter."
"Mr President, I share your view."
"We are concerned here with three different alternatives."
"We have now voted in favour of one of them, which mean that the others cease to be options."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report Vidal-Quadras Roca (A5-0465/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca' s extremely important report on methods of saving energy, particularly as regards the construction of buildings that are fit for habitation, where heating costs are the most burdensome for the citizens of the European Union."
"On this occasion, as regards the heating costs very often sustained by pensioners and the elderly, I hope that our States decide to allocate pensioners a sum of money, which would differ from region to region, to meet these costs."
"There are extremely beautiful areas of Europe such as Sicily where the cost of heating houses is very low, but there are other just as beautiful regions - in Sweden and Finland, for example - where heating costs are much higher."
"I would add Scotland to your list of places where heating costs are very high."
"Report Kauppi (A5-0466/2001)"
"I will talk about Scotland in a minute, Mr President."
"With regard to Mrs Kauppi' s report on cooperation in the field of value added tax, I have to say that I met an old school friend, Mr Bertone, at Genoa airport. He said to me, with regard to the matter at hand: 'How good you are in Europe at making us pay more taxes, at organising yourselves and reaching agreements to improve the way we pay taxes!'"
"Just like myself, Carlo Fatuzzo, Mr Bertone is from Genoa and Genoa has a reputation in Italy similar to that of Scotland in the United Kingdom: in other words, we are very thrifty, as they say."
"Indeed, my friend, Mr Bertone, of Genoa, said to me: 'Yes, you are good at making us pay out."
"Why do you not do something, rather, to make us pay less tax, which would make us Genoese happy and probably the Scots as well?"
"I hope this happens as soon as possible!'"
"I have voted against this report."
"The reason for my having done so is that the report quotes Article 95 of the Treaty as a legal basis, involving majority decision-making in the Council and codecision making for the European Parliament, and this in spite of the fact that Article 95 states that it does not cover 'fiscal provisions' ."
"What, therefore, we have here is something so crucially a matter of principle as a reorganisation of the way in which tax issues are dealt with, involving an abandonment of intergovernmental cooperation with its demands for unanimity in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty."
"I cannot support the Commission' s view that the report only concerns administrative cooperation and that the proposal would not have any fiscal consequences because it does not directly relate to tax collection."
"In the past, the Council has always rejected this position, and it changed the legal base to Articles 93 and 94, which only require that Parliament should be consulted."
"The Swedish Christian Democrats fully support the Council' s approach."
"We believe that tax issues should not be decided by majority decision in the Council and by codecision in Parliament."
"Our clear position is that, in the future too, unanimity shall be required in connection with decisions on taxes, and this in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty."
"Report Moreira da Silva (A5-0025/2002)"
"This report talks about climate change and what we must do to clean up the air."
"I totally agree, Mr President."
"However, do you remember what a beautiful day it was yesterday here in Strasbourg?"
"The temperature was 14-15 degrees and it was as if Spring had come; we all enjoyed it very much."
"Well then, Mr President, I started to wonder whether, ultimately, global warming, which we are all endeavouring to fight and which raises the average temperature of the earth, might not be better than if the earth were getting colder."
"Should we not reflect carefully before fulfilling these requirements, for maybe a little more heat in our world would be a good thing?"
"Report Watson (A5-0003/2002)"
"As you are aware, this document has been the subject of much debate, and it has also provoked opposition, particularly in Italy, as you know, Mr President."
"I want to reiterate what I have said when we have voted on the European arrest warrant and combating terrorism in the past."
"I agree that there should be rapid procedures for arresting those who ought to be arrested, whatever Member State of Europe they might flee to."
"However, my ultimate goal and the ultimate goal of the Pensioners' Party is genuinely to achieve a single code of civil procedure and a single European penal code because, when all is said and done, if we all agree that a particular deed is a crime, then we must all agree on that without exception and without differences."
"This is too important an area for there to be differences within Europe."
"Mr President, when we are reflecting on the problems of improving procedures in the House it is worth noticing that an explanation of vote of this kind is one way one can reply to a point taken by the Commissioner at the end of a debate."
"At the end of the debate on the Watson report, Mr Vitorino said that the amendment relating to the habeas corpus order would risk confusing the issue and undermine respect for human rights."
"In that he completely ignored the point that the first condition stated for the operation of that amendment was for there to be a violation of human rights in the receiving state."
"The point I made in my speech in the debate was that it is not enough to have common agreement to respect rights; you must have effective remedies."
"That text of ours would have put in an effective remedy."
"Since Parliament in its wisdom (or unwisdom) chose not to adopt it, I voted against the Watson report on the Arrest Warrant."
"Other Members from the United Kingdom will come to regret that they did not too."
"Some of my colleagues in the European Free Alliance - a majority of them - voted for the Watson report; not that they did not also regret the absence of the habeas corpus amendment, but that they felt a strong commitment in conscience, as we all do, to getting the European judicial space going forward, and thought that necessary."
"Mr President, I wish to thank you for enabling us to arrange this properly."
"I thought we had submitted the names in time, but there was some misunderstanding."
"What is at issue, then, are the anti-terrorist laws and a European arrest warrant."
"We are strongly critical of these terrorist laws, and above all of an arrest warrant, in terms both of their content and of the speed with which these laws have been devised."
"We are also critical of the fact that there has been no basic examination of the proposed laws or assessment of their impact."
"Moreover, the European Parliament has in actual fact dealt with the issue without much in the way of reflection."
"We were therefore also extremely anxious that our Amendment No 4 should be voted through today."
"Unfortunately, it was not."
"I therefore think that Parliament has not accepted its responsibilities when it comes to protecting those deprived of their freedom and safeguarding human rights."
"Following the attacks in the United States on 11 September, the work designed to produce new anti-terrorist laws within the EU has proceeded at a furious pace."
"These draft laws are extremely far-reaching, and the security of the individual may be in danger."
"The same concerns also apply to the interpretations brought to bear upon how a terrorist group is really to be defined."
"A majority of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore voted against the arrest warrant."
"All this is also having further consequences."
"In Sweden, the freezing of the assets of al-Baraka, a not-for-profit association, has directly affected a number of Swedish citizens of Somalian origin."
"It has also been made impossible for Somalians to send money to needy families and relatives."
"This is a clear example of what can be the indiscriminate effects of these laws, and the fact that measures of this type can be taken without any proof being required is an injustice committed against people."
"In my opinion, greater reflection and more impact assessments were needed before we took this decision."
"Mr President, I voted against the decision on combating terrorism because I feel it is fundamentally flawed."
"I recognise that there have been some improvements - for example in Recital 10."
"A lot of people are putting faith in the Council's statement, which is not part of the legally binding text."
"It is basically only a political promise."
"People should be extremely wary of political promises."
"The statement protects the right of people to protest, which is one of the fundamental issues that people were very concerned about."
"If it had been in the text itself it might have been legally binding."
"But there is no guarantee as to how this legislation will be used."
"Will it interfere with the rights of people who are unhappy with the status quo and want to change things?"
"We also have to look at how it will impact on foreigners, for example people from different cultural and religious backgrounds - some people in Western society are extremely wary of them."
"There is a great threat to their fundamental rights."
"On the European arrest warrant I would endorse what Mr MacCormick has said."
"It was very disappointing to see so many people in this Parliament not support an amendment that would have given people some sort of protection in relation to protecting their basic civil liberties."
"The Communist Party of Greece never misses an opportunity to denounce the fact that the capitalist mechanism and police state being built up by the European Union are capitalist society's response to the rising tide of protest and demands for justice being generated by its own anti-grass roots policy of serving the interests of big business."
"The leaders of the ÅU know full well that, despite their efforts, they cannot fool the people by cloaking their policies in pro-grass roots terms."
"This tactic was on a slow but sure course up to 11 September."
"Now, the horrendous events of that day are being used as a pretext to speed up the application of political decisions taken long ago."
"The perpetrators of and accessories to the terrorist attacks have played straight into the hands of the American and European imperialists."
"Which is why we are now examining, for the second time, the improved proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and on the European arrest warrant, the heavy artillery in the capitalist arsenal."
"Basically nothing has changed in the draft decisions, apart from a few editorial improvements to appease the reactions, and the addendum stating that ""the European Union is founded on the universal values of human dignity, liberty, equality, solidarity and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it is based on the principles of democracy and the Rule of Law""."
"The pure hypocrisy of this statement is highlighted by the fact that the framework decisions deal a very severe blow to democracy and collective and individual social rights."
"According to article 1, anyone fighting for fundamental political and social change can easily be labelled a terrorist."
"Types of protest, such as symbolic sit-ins, or the results of protests, such as interruptions to the electricity or water supply when workers go on strike, need only cause ""significant economic losses"" in order to be labelled terrorist crimes."
"The same applies to protests by farmers who block the roads."
"Extending the responsibilities of the organisations to which the ""terrorists"" belong may create a handy mechanism for prosecuting troublesome organisations and parties but it also gives them the incentive to engage in provocation."
"The only people above all suspicion are the rulers of the ÅU and the USA."
"They are in no danger of being tried on the basis of their own law, which labels acts which may ""seriously damage"" the country as terrorist acts if the perpetrator carries them out with a view to: (i) seriously frightening the people or (ii) unreasonably forcing the public authorities or an international organisation to carry out or refrain from carrying out an act or (iii) seriously destabilising or overturning the fundamental policies or constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or international organisation."
"Did the European and American imperialists do any less or any different in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chile, Greece and dozens of other countries?"
"The people throughout the world know exactly who the terrorists are."
"Likewise, they also know that violence and suppression cannot reverse the historic advance of mankind and they will continue their fight until all the terrorist laws have been repealed."
"It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, do not have a very consistent view of the fight against terrorism at all."
"I have risen on previous occasions to ask for increased border controls, including those controls at the internal borders of the Union."
"But this has not happened."
"What has in fact happened is that the policy on phasing out internal controls has been pursued unchanged."
"That is why, on Monday, at the debate on the Kessler report, I condemned the scheduled withdrawal of the 'reporting of presence' which, under the Schengen Convention, should be demanded of third country nationals who wish to move between European Union Member States."
"We are today examining the last phase of the plan to create a European arrest warrant, which seeks to abolish, for certain offences, the former extradition system between EU Member States, which gave discretionary power to the executing State, but there is an obvious contradiction as far as this point is concerned."
"We have seen the list of offences grow in size with the subsequent versions of the plan."
"However, the essential guarantees that we requested in our explanation of vote of 29 November 2001 have still not been included, such as the right for the judge of the executing country to properly check the validity of the request and for the new system not to apply to the nationals of the executing country as they should continue to enjoy maximum protection."
"The European Parliament is prepared to turn a blind eye to all these anomalies, because they are helping to build a super-State."
"At our previous sitting, however, Parliament did not hesitate to vote in favour of a resolution that refused to facilitate the extradition of terrorists or potential terrorists, who have been arrested in the EU, to the United States."
"It would, in fact, have been important to make a gesture in relation to this issue, because the United States is now facing a battle to protect the whole of the western world."
"We are, therefore, trying to achieve too much with the European arrest warrant, which is dangerous."
"And we are not doing enough to support the United States against terrorism and this is shocking."
". The British Conservatives voted strongly in favour of the framework decision on terrorism in order to underline our continued ongoing support for the war against terrorism, and to confirm our determination to ensure that the European Union presents a united front against those who seek to undermine our values and our way of life."
"However, we were obliged to vote against the proposal in relation to the European Arrest Warrant."
"As now proposed, the procedures go much further than is either necessary to deal with the terrorist threat, or desirable in terms of both safeguarding human rights or respecting due legal process, as is currently satisfied by the extradition agreement processes."
"Nonetheless, let no one be in doubt of our determination not to waver in the long war against terrorism, but we do not believe that the European Arrest Warrant as currently proposed will achieve the ends to which we are all striving."
"- (NL) The initial perplexity which the attacks of 11 September caused have not only led to unqualified support for American action in a country where the possible mastermind behind those attacks could be hiding, but has also resulted in measures being considered which would seriously affect civil rights deemed obvious hitherto."
"All the primitive ideas which guardians of law and order had ever entertained to make it easier to lock up, extradite and condemn opposition forces were suddenly given free rein."
"It is not only the American administration that comes up with new inventions such as the introduction of the notion of 'illegal combatants' , who are subsequently unable to enjoy the protection received by prisoners of war."
"Unfortunately, this development also plays a role in Europe."
"Anyone who, for a long time, had fought for the right to extradite people to countries where capital punishment still exists, for calling an end to freedoms deemed undesirable in neighbouring countries or for curtailing the rights of suspects, seized their opportunity."
"Meanwhile, those who, in panic, allowed themselves to be convinced of the need for such draconian measures are starting to consider the implications."
"This morning, the President of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats rightly said that support for Russian action against Chechnya cannot be justified in the name of combating terrorism."
"The fresh proposal by Mr Watson is an improvement, but not yet sufficient to prevent accidents."
"(DE) I did not abstain in the final vote on the report through opposition to the European arrest warrant. It was much more the case that I was opposed to the rushed procedure with which this matter was dealt with."
"Report Rapkay (A5-0002/2002)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Rapkay' s document on State aid in the European Union - both on my own account and on behalf of the Pensioners' Party - but while I was voting I was thinking, Mr President."
"Should we not consider the money that governments use to cover and make good pension fund deficits to be State aid too?"
"When the State budget intervenes to make good the balance of pension funds, that, in my opinion, is State aid which distorts competition in the European Union between different systems and procedures for managing pension funds in Europe."
"We need greater competition when it comes to pension types available on the market too."
"I hope this is achieved in the future."
"Mr President, I just want to say, in addition to casting my vote just now, that we need to attempt to make the concept of State aid totally clear."
"Today' s document addresses this subject - which has already been dealt with in the past - in a number of respects, it develops and analyses it and also welcomes in principle the decline of that aid during the period 1997 to 1999."
"It remains to address the issue of regional aid, the money that passes from the State - for regional tax income is not sufficient, at least in Italy - to the regions and from the regions directly to many bodies and companies, which thus break competition rules and distort the market, particularly in respect of other companies which, for example, are not based in regions with a special statute, which are particularly favoured."
". (PT) This report on State aid closely follows the line of the previous report, endorsing the observation that there was a reduction in State aid during the period between 1997 and 1999, specifically due to reduction in aid in Germany and Italy, the two countries that provide the highest levels of State aid."
"The rationale of the report is based on defending the reduction of State aid and on stepping up the measures used in this context, specifically tax measures."
"The objective, in accordance with the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit, is to achieve a steady reduction in State aid by 2003, only allowing aid, in exceptional circumstances, specially requested by the Member States."
"Existing Community aid will, of course, continue."
"Nevertheless, with the creation of the State aid assessment panel, pressure on Member States to reduce aid will increase, with States basing their approach on protecting competition, ignoring the problems suffered by weaker economies and pilfering America' s own policy, which continues to grant State aid in various economic sectors, in defiance of WTO rules."
"This is why we have voted against the report."
"- (NL) The rapporteur is backing the March 2000 Summit in Lisbon which declared that the EU would be the world' s most competitive region within ten years."
"The high price we need to pay for this will even lead to many Europeans not having a sense of victory when the project proves successful."
"In the US and Japan, many people are worse off than in large parts of Europe, despite considerable company profits and growth."
"Competition means that those who manage to sell the cheapest products and services at minimum cost survive to the detriment of everyone else."
"The latter cannot, therefore, afford to take issues such as human rights, working conditions, public health, the environment and animal welfare too seriously."
"State support, government initiatives and Community enterprises are crucial instruments for correcting the adverse effects of the market and for promoting the well-being of people and of the environment."
"I condemn state support if it is aimed only at using tax revenue to compete better against others within a free market, as in the case of aviation, but not at maintaining facilities and regional employment in vulnerable regions."
"The re-nationalisation of regional policy, feared by the rapporteur, cuts down on red-tape and waste, but does need to be offset by contributions provided, in a spirit of solidarity, by rich Member States for the benefit of the poor."
"Report Martens (A5-0017/2002)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mr Martens' important report on education and training, but I hope that the pensioners of the different sectors of European industry will soon stop playing cards or sitting at home in front of the television, counting the days they have left to live, and be used, if they so wish, to pass on their knowledge to workers, especially young workers."
"For example, pensioners from the banking sector could teach new employees how to manage the bank' s money and achieve good results, and a similar process could be introduced in other sectors: there should be more pensioners in vocational training and lifelong learning."
"Report Olsson (A5-0467/2001)"
"Mr President, I wish to point out with some emphasis that certain items in Parliament's report on the ongoing handling of BSE are having negative effects on Europe's farmers and I therefore voted against these unrealistic demands, which had been introduced by some elements in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"To be specific, these were the obligatory reduction to the age of 24 months, the debate on omnivores in connection with BSE, and also aspects of waste management."
"I am, furthermore, opposed to the demand for a reform of the CAP with food safety as one of its objectives, as this is already set down very definitely in Agenda 2000."
"Our agricultural policy is founded on the principle of multifunctionality and on family-run farms, and the production of safe and high-quality food is a matter of concern for farmers like us."
"By doing this, we would be sending the wrong signal."
"The delegation of the Austrian People's Party in this Parliament has therefore abstained in the final vote."
"I want to wish the presidency and all the interpreters 'bon appétit' before focusing on the matter at hand, which does nothing to whet the appetite, for this is a document on BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy."
"Mr President, paragraph 5 'calls on the Member States to step up ... compliance with the temporary ban on MBM' ."
"But why, Mr President, is it 'temporary' ?"
"If meat-and-bone meal is dangerous, we must make the ban on using it permanent and leave the firms that produce meat-and-bone meal to make something else - maybe they will produce Italian-style spaghetti or spaghetti with pesto, which would be a much more appropriate subject for debate at this precise moment."
"In other words, Mr President, meat-and-bone meal should be taken completely off the market once and for all."
"On the occasion of the debate on the Olsson report on the monitoring of the BSE crisis, I would like to draw attention to the scandalous decree handed down by the Court of Justice on 13 December 2001 which condemns France for having failed to observe the Commission' s request to lift the ban on British beef imports."
"The decree cites the higher powers of the Commission, which itself refers to the superiority of the freedom of movement."
"This raises a question of principles - what sort of Europe do we want?"
"A Europe where each nation has the right to exercise its fundamental choices, or a Europe where the Commission determines from on high what is the so-called common good?"
"We believe that each nation must be sovereign."
"With regard to public health, in particular, if one of the Member States democratically chooses one option, the others must note the choice made, even if they do not agree with it."
"We must stress that the French Government has put itself in an impossible situation, by ratifying the Treaty of Amsterdam, which gives the Commission the powers that it is now using against us."
"When will governments realise that the texts that they sign will have some consequences?"
"When will they realise that their actions will catch up with them?"
"When will they stop pulling the wool over their own eyes, and over the eyes of the citizens at the same time?"
"In the wake of the decree of 13 December, there is no point in the French Government saying that it will not obey it, the Commission will not go to the trouble of complaining to the Court of Justice to request a penalty payment for each day that the French Government failed to execute the decision."
"We will therefore have to pay a ransom for having the right to use - and this is still on a provisional basis - a fundamental competence that we ourselves foolishly abandoned when we signed the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Of course, this absurd situation will only last the length of the election campaign in France."
"As soon as the elections are over, our next government will probably rush to obey the decree on the quiet."
"What we need is a fundamental reform of the Treaties in order to restore national sovereignty."
". (FR) I voted in favour of this own-initiative report."
"The European Union must now face its responsibilities in this matter."
"I voted in favour of a reform of the common agricultural policy that takes into account the objective of food safety."
"It must be clearly understood that this does not involve placing farmers and environmentalists at loggerheads."
"The farmers want to provide produce that is of the best possible quality."
"Environmentalists want to have renewed confidence in produce that does not pose a threat to their health."
"Those who are questioning this principle bear a heavy responsibility for the future."
"We must automatically apply the precautionary principle."
"The zero tolerance principle must always prevail in any matter regarding the protection of public health."
"The report considers that the existing stocks of animal meal and foodstuffs containing such meal must be destroyed and insists upon a ban on feeding animal meal to ruminants."
"Furthermore, when a case of BSE is confirmed, removing all livestock herds from the food chain always seems to be the solution that will provide the greatest guarantees for the safety of our fellow citizens."
"Alternative methods to destroying all livestock herds can only be implemented once they have been proven to be effective and only if they offer the same level of safety."
"We must proceed with maximum caution due to scientific uncertainties about the methods of contamination."
"That is why I believe it is necessary to improve and develop research into TSEs and other as yet unknown diseases and infective agents."
"I also think that it is essential to monitor the sanctions and measures imposed on Member States that do not observe this legislation."
". BSE undoubtedly triggered a crisis of confidence on the part of consumers and an economic catastrophe in the agriculture and food processing industries."
"It is in the interests of all concerned to ensure that lessons are learned and sensible measures put in place to eradicate BSE."
"Such measures must of course be justified by sound scientific data."
"It seems to me that the 30-month threshold is justifiable, and forecast to succeed in rendering the UK BSE-free within a reasonable timescale."
"The main lesson to learn from BSE and other recent food scares surely is that we must favour a return to natural methods of food production and feeding of livestock."
"In Scotland for example, the majority of livestock has historically been grass-fed, resulting in a relatively low incidence of BSE in that country."
". (EL) The report on the basic technical principles for monitoring BSE tackles the right issues in the right way."
"We agree with the proposals addressing the principle of prevention and the proposals containing a final definition of terms and concepts, which will prevent the same issues from being interpreted differently in the Member States, given that the current lack of clarity is delaying the application of legislation."
"We also agree with the principle of zero tolerance as regards even traces of dioxins in food and animal feed and the ban on the use of the bones of one species of animal in the feed for the same species of animal."
"However, we have acute reservations on a number of other points in the report."
"For example, although we do not disagree with the proposal on reforming the common agricultural policy per se, what worries us is that the Commission may use it to cut back on subsidies or the production of basic agricultural products."
"This has already happened with cotton, using high nitrate levels and environmental protection as a pretext, and with tobacco, using the anti-smoking campaign and the protection of public health as a pretext."
"We likewise disagree with the proposal to give the Community services more powers of control, because we feel that they have yet to prove that they are more sensitive or more efficient than the national authorities in this sector."
"The repeated cases of dioxins in chickens, mad cows etc., which are only discovered with hindsight, to the detriment of public health, confirm our reading and justify our opposition to any increase in Community powers."
"Finally, we should like to point out that, as long as reducing production costs, no matter how, and increasing the profits of the huge monopolies in the sector continues to be the primary and decisive criterion for producing which agricultural products and food, the problems will not only not go away, they will multiply."
"Any controls, especially preventive controls, however important, cannot reverse these trends, as the fact that most problems are identified with hindsight, once they have taken on tragic proportions and caused massive public health problems, goes to show."
"That is why we believe that we cannot achieve complete food safety with communications and resolutions, however progressive they may be, because they cannot and will not touch capitalist methods of production."
"We support the report and controls to restrict these problems, albeit critically; at the same time, we must point out that we shall only have complete food safety if the basic criterion for producing food is consumer protection, animal protection and environmental protection, rather than the profit motive."
"- (NL) Feeding animal slaughter waste to the surviving animals within the same animal species is something that can only be dreamed up by somebody for whom financial considerations are paramount."
"Cows and sheep that normally only eat vegetable feed are turned into cannibals."
"It is not surprising that something as unnatural as that should lead to fatal diseases which were hitherto unknown."
"People still fail to draw the right conclusions from this."
"In a free market, the person who manages to produce in the cheapest manner wins the competitive battle, even if this is at the expense of jobs, the environment, animal welfare and public health."
"This is why there remains a great temptation to continue to use animal and bone meal in the traditional way."
"Some undertakings, some Member States and some Members of this Parliament are of the opinion that everything can be solved by slaughtering healthy cattle for preventive purposes in the vicinity of a source of infection."
"This was the case during the BSE crisis and again with infections caused by foot and mouth disease."
"Anyone who attempts to tackle parts of this failing livestock policy has my support."
"Rapporteur Olsson and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy rightly call for more monitoring of compliance with bans already introduced, stiffer penalties for infringements and the destruction of existing stocks."
"However, in order to take away the temptation to commit an infringement, the economic advantages also need to be systematically removed."
"The issue of the French embargo on British beef, which I brought up during yesterday' s debate on the Olsson report, exemplifies the deeply undemocratic way in which the European institutions operate."
"The Court of Justice condemned France in law, in the name of a strictly uniform vision of the single market, whilst acknowledging that France may essentially have valid reasons for protecting its population, given the uncertainties surrounding the traceability and labelling of British bovine carcasses."
"The French Government declared its intention not to apply the Court' s decree and the Commission demonstrated that it was prepared to impose severe penalties upon France."
"We are therefore faced with a legal system which forces Member States either to stop implementing the measures that they consider essential for protecting their nation' s public health, or to buy the right to do this."
"Of course, it is primarily the French Government that is to be held responsible for this situation, having cheerfully transferred food safety to Community jurisdiction by signing the Treaty of Amsterdam. The French Government is now discovering, several months later, the regrettable consequences of taking such a decision so lightly."
"More generally, however, the Olsson report should have brought into question an entire system that constitutes an attack upon democracy."
"This is a system that denies a nation the right to take measures which it considers necessary for ensuring public health, even if other nations have a different view."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 1.13 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference (continuation)"
"We now continue with the debate on the Council and Commission statements on financing of development aid with a view to the UN International Conference in Monterrey on 21 and 22 March."
"Mr President, one of the consequences of globalisation is the emergence of the feeling of belonging to the world."
"This means that our citizens increasingly feel that the poverty and underdevelopment in which a large part of the population lives affect them and makes them demand that the public authorities demonstrate greater commitment in the field of development cooperation."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I hope that this message is conveyed to you when you arrive: responding to this request from the citizens for greater solidarity requires giving the least-developed countries the opportunity to implement the changes necessary to achieve the progress and well-being of their peoples and to make the framework that you have described for us this morning and, with which we are very happy, a reality."
"It also requires, however, a fixed-term commitment to go beyond what was agreed in Laeken and to establish a strict timetable for States that have not yet done so to achieve, within the deadline set, the objective of allocating 0.7% of gross domestic product to official development aid and to do so in order to comply with an ethical requirement: we cannot continue to tolerate the living conditions that so many millions of people, who embody our own dignity and our own rights, are forced to endure."
"Solidarity is part of our acquis."
"We must also make this commitment for the sake of coherence, because the challenge of eradicating poverty, which the European Union has taken up, requires a budgetary effort in line with the magnitude of the task facing us."
"And because, without development, democracy and respect for human rights are nothing more than pipe dreams."
"And, lastly, because contributing to the progress and development of peoples is the best weapon with which to ensure international peace and security, something that, unfortunately, not all countries seem to understand."
"I am sorry the Council is not here too."
"They knew that we started at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, Mrs Ferreira had good things to say about solidarity and people' s demands that solidarity be shown with Third World countries."
"Unfortunately, that is not the development we are seeing in Denmark at the moment where we are cutting back on development aid in a way that I think is very unfortunate."
"Even though we have cut back, we shall of course still be among the largest providers of aid, but it is, at any event, totally the wrong signal that we in Denmark, and the Danish Government, are sending at the moment."
"I also fear that the Montreal Conference will just be another conference, with no practical consequences, and I should therefore like to highlight three practical issues in my speech here today."
"The first is the demand for development aid."
"I think it absolutely crucial that we set practical objectives for when the individual EU countries are to have reached a figure of 0.7%."
"As far as I remember, we have been hearing about this 0.7% since 1974, and the vast majority of countries are still a very long way from achieving that goal."
"That is why I am also looking forward to hearing what the Commission has elicited from its visit to the different countries in terms of establishing definite time frames."
"These are what are needed."
"The second thing I should like to urge is that Mr Lamy' s efforts to remove trade barriers - efforts which have so far been directed towards the least developed countries - should also apply to other countries for, without trade and without the opportunity to trade without customs barriers, no progress can of course be made."
"The third thing I should like to emphasise is that we must look at what we can do in the public sector with a view to promoting private investment, and I believe that, in this area, we can bring about more fruitful cooperation than we have done so far."
"In that way, it will also be possible to translate the World Economic Forum' s words into practical action."
"Mr President, on 8 November 2001, the Council of Development Ministers urged the European Union and Member States to increase development aid."
"I believe that we must now take firm and visible action."
"How do we go about doubling the current level of aid given by industrialised countries to achieve the required USD 50 billion a year, as recommended in several of the preparatory reports for the Monterrey conference, so that we can meet the most basic requirements of developing countries, particularly in terms of education and health?"
"What stage has the Commission reached in its negotiations with each Member State on a timetable to enable us to achieve the objective of 0.7%, which was set some 32 years ago?"
"Although the attitude of the United States is placing the very existence of aid for development under serious threat, the Monterrey conference would be an opportunity for the European Union to prepare and set in motion a strict process to rigorously monitor this timetable."
"There are still other avenues to be explored."
"Firstly, we must cancel debt and go much further than the HIPC initiative. The crisis in Argentina is an urgent reminder - as if it were needed - of the need for us to act."
"The world parliamentary forum, held some days ago in Porto Alegre, also recommends, by means of a resolution, that the United Nations establish an international tribunal to combat debt in order to guarantee financing for development."
"Furthermore, it is time to seriously consider introducing a tax on international financial transfers."
"Lastly, reforms in the financial system and international trade system are obviously needed in order to make them more democratic and to combat the mechanisms which cause poverty in developing countries."
"Furthermore, as regards the current situation with aid, we must ensure that payments of sums are made in a swift and efficient manner as, at the end of 2000, EUR 9 billion remained in the coffers of the European Development Fund and we must also change the focus of the ODA."
"It is, first and foremost, private investors who find this attractive, as it helps to further develop each country' s specialist knowledge of production niches for exporting goods in terms of the requirements of the global market and not of populations."
"The commitments made towards developing countries must be honoured."
"This is a legitimate expectation of the 2.8 billion people who live on less than USD 2 per day."
"Mr President, every time we discuss the issue of the poor countries, out comes the usual catalogue of figures: 800 million people suffering from malnutrition; 40% of the world' s population suffering from malaria; 2 million people contracting aids each year in Africa alone; almost a billion children who cannot read or write; water shortages; health and social problems and so on and so forth."
"However, Mr President, we need to take action."
"There is an urgent need for more practical measures from industrialised countries and international financial institutions, not least through more effective cooperation, without duplication or overlapping of effort. That means more careful monitoring of the allocation of development funds."
"In other words, we need practical measures implemented with the greatest transparency and with the minimum bureaucracy necessary for the monitoring process."
"Of course, the March 2002 International Conference at Monterrey and the Johannesburg world summit to be held subsequently this September will be extremely important in this respect."
"Their success would certainly be a clear signal for further, more general acceleration of measures boosting sustainable development."
"Key areas for action include mustering local financial resources for development and international resources, including countries in international trading and so on."
"The European Union is certainly the main donor but, together with the individual States, it has a key role to play in this respect."
"We need closer cooperation with United Nations organisations such as the FAO in order to ensure that the allocation of these funds genuinely serves to improve the levels of nourishment and living conditions of poor peoples."
"Mr President, there is no dispute that the European Union is contributing to the war on poverty, but, as we all know, we fall a long way short of our declared objectives."
"The removal of poverty, backwardness and ignorance must be first on the list if we are to combat terrorism."
"A new world economic order and a new kind of politics are on the agenda - things that were called for by the more than 60 000 participants in the Second World Social Forum in Porto Alegre."
"Argentina is a shocking illustration of where neoliberalism will take us."
"Those who want to provide really effective development aid should not close their ears to the message from Porto Alegre, but actively involve those democratic forces that are active in that forum, in the brainstorming process and in the implementation of a new politics of development."
"Mr President, I have listened very carefully to all of the opinions expressed here by the honourable Members who have spoken in this debate."
"Most of the speeches raised issues which the Council, of course, bore very much in mind when it took the decisions necessary to achieve the Monterrey consensus."
"Most of the requests that I have heard are also shared by the European Union and the Council, which represents the European Union, and the Commission, which will also represent the European Union at the Monterrey Conference."
"Naturally, I would say that it is highly praiseworthy that these opinions should be expressed in this parliamentary forum, which must be the forum for expressing our ambitions and our aspirations."
"I would say, however, that Parliament also well understands and I imagine that it is sensitive to the fact that we are immersed in an international negotiation in which it is not simply enough for the European Union to hold and to express its ideas, of which we are proud, but instead to try to conclude an agreement with everyone else."
"I have to say that the European Union is in a very special position at this type of conference."
"It often finds itself in the middle, between some partners at the same level of development, which very frequently do not share our ideas and are not quite so generous, and developing countries which, naturally, do not agree with us, because they have the right to demand much of us and, often, much more than we can normally give."
"I would say that the Monterrey consensus contains all the basic and fundamental elements and, from everything that we have heard today in Parliament, I would say that we have sufficient baggage, both in the Council Presidency and the Commission, to carry on having faith in our ideas."
"We already know that there is consensus and that the consensus is very broad, but this does not exclude us from being more ambitious in Monterrey."
"I have already listed these ambitions but I wish to repeat them."
"The European Union intends to issue a message in defence of its values, which I listed previously: the defence of democracy, of good governance, of strengthening the institutional development of aid-receiving countries, the Rule of Law, peace and security and human rights."
"All of these elements that have been mentioned here in the European Parliament are fundamental values of our culture and civilisation and will be the values that guide us in the debates in Monterrey."
"In any event, I would say that we have sufficient grounds to feel satisfied, since the Monterrey consensus takes up all of this, perhaps not as far as we would have liked to see, but it does address these issues in a substantial way."
"Let us hope that at this meeting, which will be held in March, the European Union, which has a common and single position and counts on the support of Parliament, can go even further with these principles and these objectives that I have expressed and which, as I have seen, enjoy the support of this Parliament."
"I should also like to say, in conclusion, that the Community delegation intends to include five Members of the European Parliament and that, therefore, Parliament will be fully integrated in the delegation and will have first hand information."
"Naturally, I remain at the disposition of this House and at your disposition, Mr President, to return here after Monterrey and inform you on the outcome of the Conference."
"Mr President, it is very important to stick to the view that volume matters when we talk about these problems."
"It is also very important to remember that fighting global poverty is not a short-term repair job in the poor countries."
"We often hear the view that, since we have been giving development aid to Africa for 25 or 30 years and they are still poor, maybe the whole approach is wrong."
"That is a fundamental mistake."
"This is not a short-term project."
"Any global society with just a minimum of decency has to understand that the transfer of resources from the rich to the poor must be a permanent feature."
"That approach alters the focus of the discussion about what is wrong with development cooperation."
"In fact, it holds the key to understanding what globalisation means, and it means taking an inclusive approach to viewing the real world."
"We had better get used to the idea that a permanent transfer is part of the challenge facing us."
"This is not the same as accepting that development cooperation should simply deteriorate into becoming some sort of social gap-filling."
"The whole agenda for structural or political reform vis-à-vis governance is absolutely essential to achieving real progress."
"But it makes a big difference if seen as something we will have to do for some more years or as part of the future."
"The whole attitude of different countries to the idea of sharing in this and of this being inseparable from the world view in general is crucial."
"Mrs Dybkjaer and Mrs Boudjenah mentioned the 0.7 % target for the EU."
"This is on our agenda for the first time."
"It has never really been discussed at EU level before, either between the Commission and the Member States or between Member States themselves."
"So we have made it a new area of discussion."
"We have established some sort of peer pressure and the response from the series of discussions in capital cities that we carried out before Laeken was in a sense encouraging because all Member States reacted positively to the need to establish some sort of calendar."
"In this area decision-making still lies with the Member States - the Commission has acquired no new powers here - but this discussion is now legitimate and we will bring it to the fore as one aspect of our input for the Conference in Monterrey."
"This discussion will not end at Monterrey; it is a reflection of how Europe sees itself and the role it should play in the world that we want to move forward in this area."
"In response to Mr van den Berg and Mr van den Bos, who both commented on the imbalance between military and development spending and the whole philosophy behind this, I would point to the general view that the cradle of European and Western civilisation was ancient Greece."
"Personally, I think it was home to the kind of Europe I want to represent and is the part of Greek history with which I want to identify. I think and hope that for Europe the cradle was in fact Athens rather than Sparta."
"This is my response to what Members said about the balance between the military approach and this more humanistic or morally driven way of defining our role and our philosophy in this world."
"This is the baggage we will be taking to Monterrey and this is, philosophically speaking, the message we will deliver there."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Preparations for the March 2002 meeting of the UNCHR in Geneva"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the March 2002 meeting of the UNCHR in Geneva."
"Mr President, this debate provides the opportunity for an exchange of views prior to the deliberations of the 58th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"The Human Rights Contact Group has already brought together representatives of non-governmental organisations, Members of Parliament, civil servants from the EU institutions and others to discuss key concerns for Geneva."
"The broader the input, the more confident the EU can be in the approach which it adopts at the UN Commission."
"As ever, when you invite the Commission to these annual debates, it comes at a time when the EU has not definitively decided upon the initiatives which it will take at the UNCHR and their final form will only be determined after negotiations on the ground in Geneva."
"Regrettably, there is all too much choice when looking around the world for examples of human rights violations."
"That is why the EU must adopt a coherent approach when determining the best way to promote respect for human rights."
"Our communication on human rights of last May, and the subsequent conclusions by the General Affairs Council, set out a strategy for such an approach by an EU that would actively engage with the world in the promotion of human rights through, for example, the human rights clause which forms a regular feature of Community agreements and which finds its most advanced expression in the Cotonou Agreement; through the dialogue which we have undertaken to conduct in contacts with all third countries, as reinforced in the guidelines on human rights dialogues which were adopted by the Council last December; through our engagement with NGOs, including the extensive funding for human rights projects channelled through the European initiative for democratisation and human rights and mainstream programmes and through our cooperation with the UN and other organisations."
"These factors should be taken into account by those who point to the inevitable element of selectivity in the countries and themes which are the subject of EU initiatives at the UNCHR."
"They are not the sum total of the EU' s human rights policy necessarily, just an element of it."
"There are several issues which will feature throughout this year' s UN Commission."
"First, the highly regrettable failure by the US to secure re-election to the Commission and the participation of several states whose human rights records are - to put it very politely - less than acceptable."
"This means that the EU will have to work extra hard to ensure that core human rights values are reflected in the decisions taken."
"Second, the fight against terrorism, which has rightly permeated every corner of the political debate since 11 September."
"Human rights considerations are involved here at several levels."
"We must guard against any muddling of concepts."
"The EU maintains the important distinction that states are the perpetrators of human rights violations, whilst terrorists are particularly abhorrent criminals."
"And it is right that actions by states - whether at a legislative, judicial or penal level - are subject to international law and proper scrutiny."
"In fighting terrorism, we and our allies must uphold the values of respect for international human rights and humanitarian law."
"The international community must also be alert to opportunistic attempts by states to justify domestic repression and crackdowns by claiming that they are ""fighting terrorism""."
"Zimbabwe is the most clear example of this."
"The fight against racism will also be given due prominence at the 58th session of the UN Commission, and the EU may present a statement on the issue as in previous years."
"After a rather bumpy journey from Durban, we now have a solid declaration and programme of action - a welcome development which we must now put to good use."
"Combating racism, xenophobia and discrimination against minorities is one of the four priorities under the European initiative for democracy and human rights for the period 2002 to 2004."
"EUR 17 million per year have been set aside in order to support NGOs and other organisations in the promotion of rights and awareness-raising as a concrete follow-up to the World Conference."
"Finally, a word on two countries of particular interest, both to me and to this Parliament."
"First, China."
"This is the only country with which the EU has a dedicated human rights dialogue. The human rights situation in China rightly gives rise to a great deal of concern - from the extensive application of the death penalty to the suppression of religious and cultural rights in Tibet, Xinjiang and elsewhere and restrictions on the freedom of expression as evidenced in the recent measures on the use of the Internet."
"In this difficult context, the EU dialogue and seminars - the last of which, in December 2001 brought together European and Chinese experts to discuss the prevention of torture and the right to education - are one conduit for encouragement, cooperation and criticism."
"As the General Affairs Council has underscored, progress on the ground is a necessary corollary of the dialogue and that is why we evaluate the dialogue annually."
"Second, in Iran, some progress in reform is offset by continuing serious human rights concerns."
"The UN Special Representative on Iran highlighted this at the Third Committee last year, referring in particular to the sharp increase in public hangings and floggings."
"The EU is engaging with Iran in an effort to secure improvement."
"The positive outcome for the EU resolution at the Third Committee shows that the international community shares our concerns."
"The acceptance of a visit by the Special Representative would be a further step in the right direction."
"The mandate for an EC trade and cooperation agreement is currently under discussion in the Council."
"I can assure honourable Members that human rights considerations will play an important part in any future negotiations."
"Parliament' s resolutions and debates are a crucial stimulus to the process of preparing for the Commission on Human Rights."
"I hope that, if possible, representatives from Parliament will, as in previous years, visit the UNCHR in session and that they will contribute to the wider debate."
"In the past few years, Mrs Robinson, the High Commissioner, has tried her level best to turn the UN Human Rights Committee into the public conscience, and she deserves all credit for this, in my opinion."
"However, that does not detract from the fact that an increasing number of questions arise surrounding this annual high mass in Geneva."
"The human rights organisation summed the situation up as follows: it is the foxes that are having to watch over the chicken' s eggs."
"It is indeed suspicious that countries such as Kenya, Sudan, Togo and Congo, which do not have particularly good track records when it comes to respecting human rights, should chair this committee and help determine the standards."
"In addition to the composition of the committee, the procedure - notably the system of majority voting - also raises questions."
"Governments that are the focus of investigation by NGOs often stick together in order to defend their own common interests, apparently under the motto: if we spare others, we do not run the risk of being condemned ourselves."
"That is why I support what Commissioner Nielson said a moment ago."
"Now that the US no longer forms part of this Committee, the European Union should take over the helm more than ever before."
"Europe must adopt a more assertive and consistent role when defending human rights."
"It must support more resolutions, also with regard to large countries, such as China and Russia."
"Some European Member States all too easily swallow their principles if economic interests are at stake."
"In addition, the Union must insist on the committee' s recommendations actually being followed up."
"A great deal of money is being spent on early warning, but the experts' reports on this matter are systematically overlooked."
"The credibility of the Human Rights Committee in Geneva, and of human rights policy full stop, is at stake today, and I believe that, in this connection, the European Union bears a very heavy responsibility."
"Mr President, I am pleased to say that I have attended the UN Commission on two previous occasions, with both Mr van Van Hecke and Mr Wuori, who are taking part in the debate this afternoon."
"The Council said that we boast a long tradition in Europe on human rights, but it must be recognised that sometimes we hesitate in condemning the human rights abuses carried out by our so-called friendly states."
"I would urge that we must never hesitate; we must apply the same rules and standards regardless."
"Double standards undermine our highest ethics and our aspirations for a world free from human rights abuses."
"I agree absolutely with everything the Commission has said."
"However, in relation to the Cotonou and Association Agreements, I would say that we must enact the human rights and democracy clauses when human rights abuses occur."
"Anything else will be seen as a pitiful endorsement of such abuses."
"We cannot, and must not, look the other way, for one day people will look the other way when it happens to us."
"The young people and the others who look down on the Chamber today wonder what we talk about."
"We talk about a world where we can celebrate difference, where there is no persecution because someone's colour, creed, belief or sexuality is different from another's."
"I would just like to finish, regardless of any prepared speech, on what is absolutely essential and vital to remember."
"Pastor Niemöller said: ""When they came for the communists, I did not speak out because I was not a communist."
"When they came for the Jews, I did not speak out because I was not a Jew."
"When they came for the trade unionists, I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist."
"When they came for me - there was no one left to speak out."""
"We must ensure that we are never hypocritical in the defence of human rights, and 11 September must teach us surely that the same rules must be applied regardless of whether a country is our enemy or our friend."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, the European Parliament has lofty ambitions in terms of human rights."
"We have a responsibility, or moral duty, always to pay attention to human rights abuses wherever they occur."
"We therefore support the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva."
"It is an important forum for promoting these issues to the global arena."
"More and more countries are signing fine declarations and international conventions, but these are often not complied with."
"Even though more and more countries are officially democracies, we know that - every second of every day, throughout the world - horrific treatment is meted out to human rights campaigners, campaigners for democracy and a variety of leaders."
"This year, the focus is very much upon terrorism and the campaign against terrorism. You too have talked about this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"These matters are obviously important, but they are extremely closely linked to human rights."
"It is a human right not to be affected by terrorism."
"Terrorism is also born out of oppression and the lack of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"I hope that the meeting in Geneva will be characterised by discussion of these issues."
"There is a broad agenda of issues that the EU must tackle in Geneva: violence against women, the situation of children, torture and the death penalty."
"Declarations are needed in these areas."
"A lot of countries give considerable cause for concern."
"Allow me to mention three areas."
"First of all, China, which holds the very dubious world record for the number of executions carried out there."
"Every day, there are reports of torture, the imprisonment of dissidents and the oppression of the people of Tibet, of the Falun Gong movement and of all those who are fighting for democracy."
"Year after year, we appeal for a resolution on China."
"Every year the same thing happens, namely that there is no such resolution."
"Let there be a resolution this year."
"Secondly, Zimbabwe."
"Every day, we can observe the vicious spiral of murder and persecution through which this country is sinking ever more deeply and completely into the abyss."
"We must show that our patience is at an end."
"Finally, Tunisia."
"Somewhat away from the main headlines, extremely serious human rights abuses occur there too."
"Mr President, the working environment of the UN Commission on Human Rights has been described as a sea of sorrows that knows no shores."
"While we are now once again steering our EU vessel into these waters we must avoid the sort of recklessness Odysseus showed when he sailed past the Pillars of Hercules out to the open sea."
"Although the EU has no coherent policy or strategy on human rights, with certain exceptions such as torture and the death penalty - in other words it lacks the assurance afforded by a compass and the firm guidance offered by nautical charts - we must steer our course at least with the help of bright stars and reference points."
"The United States having failed to join the Commission last year, the EU is now the flagship of the Western European Group in Geneva."
"For that reason it is especially important that the Union should have an integrated policy based on clear geographical and thematic priorities, which does not grope about in the dark so much as it once did."
"President Cox last stressed the major significance of human rights in the EU and the work of this Parliament this morning."
"This should not be allowed to become just a rhetorical commitment."
"Undisturbed by commercial considerations and the songs of other such sirens, the EU must be able to allow its celebratory commitments to become a practical reality, and adopt an active position on difficult questions, such as China' s human rights violations with particular reference to the situation in Mongolia and in Tibet, or Russia' s behaviour, especially in Chechnya."
"In this connection neither can we allow the fight against terrorism in any way to jeopardise human rights and the principle of the Rule of Law, or tolerate their abuse as just an excuse for perhaps otherwise questionable intervention."
"Mr President, tomorrow, Parliament is to adopt an excellent decision, proposed by several groups, Article 8 of which mentions a number of countries. However, there are of course countries not mentioned here, and I would call for these not to be forgotten at this meeting."
"I would also especially call upon the Council not to forget Turkey, which still holds political prisoners in solitary confinement, when combating torture is discussed."
"I would urge that the prisoners in Camp X-Ray, who are being held there in defiance of the Geneva Convention, should not be forgotten."
"I would also urge that, when political and social rights are discussed, there should be no forgetting Turkey again, which is now in the process of banning the HADEP party because it is close to winning the minimum 10% of the votes it needs to be represented in the Turkish Parliament."
"I would also again call for the United States and China to be remembered when the death penalty is discussed and for its not to be overlooked that the United States has still not approved the International Criminal Court by ratifying the Statute of Rome."
"I would also say to the Commission that I very much approve of these agreements which we draw up in relation to third countries and which have human rights clauses attached."
"I just do not understand why observance of the agreements is not rather more strictly enforced, and I am thinking particularly in this context of Israel which has an agreement with the EU that is quite clearly not observed."
"I do not understand why such breaches have no repercussions and why the agreement is not cancelled immediately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the wonderful speech that Mr de Miguel has given, I believe that we can safely bet that the Council and the European Union will this year adopt, as they did last year and the year before that in Geneva, a scandalous, shameful, cowardly position, which, unfortunately, will not be the one that Parliament defends."
"I think that we can be absolutely sure, that we can bet one hundred to one, that there will be no resolution on China, no resolution on Tibet, that there will be no support given to the European Union for resolutions on the situation of women in Saudi Arabia, that there will be no resolution or support from the Union for a resolution on Tunisia."
"There will not be anything - like last year, although it is true that, last year, the European Union even came to an arrangement so that it would not have the United States to deal with this year."
"I shall not even mention Chechnya."
"Commissioner Nielson is still trying to find Chechnya on the world map."
"Even within Parliament, Mr Oostlander and his accomplice, Mr Sakellariou - but this will not come a surprise to anyone - have even sabotaged an initiative to organise a meeting between two negotiators, one Chechen and one Russian."
"This is how the situation of human rights really stands."
"I do not think that we can turn a blind eye to this."
"Mr President, the United Nations Human Rights Convention meets in Geneva every year, and every year the Chinese leadership puts pressure on its trading partners in order to prevent Peking's human rights violations getting on the agenda."
"A lot has changed this year."
"The USA was not re-elected to membership of the Human Rights Convention and now has only observer status."
"The EU can no longer, then, hide behind the Americans."
"The misery of the Tibetans, the stifling of their religious and cultural life, the merciless persecutions and arrests that have gone on for decades are not forgotten."
"Because these people refrain from every kind of terrorism, they are not permanently on the front pages of newspapers, and yet they are very much present with us."
"As long as one and a half years ago, Parliament called for the Tibetan government-in-exile to be recognised in the event of the UN-sponsored Sino-Tibetan negotiations not leading to Tibet's autonomy."
"An EU Special Envoy for Tibet was able to assume important coordination roles."
"In his great October speech to this House, the Dalai Lama again expounded his concept of the middle way and urged Peking to take part in direct negotiations without preconditions."
"It is, then, high time that the European Union itself got involved in Geneva, in order to bring in a resolution and win the support of responsible members of the Convention."
"The Chinese must not deceive themselves."
"We welcome their membership of the WTO and their contributions to the international coalition against terrorism."
"Nothing, though, can justify the brutal treatment they mete out to religious and ethnic minorities in Tibet as well as in Inner Mongolia and in Eastern Turkestan."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, the Europeans' time has come!"
"Let us at last give substance and life to our commitment to uphold human rights absolutely."
"Mr President, in spite of Mr Dupuis' gloomy forecast, the UN Commission on Human Rights conference in Geneva is a new opportunity to make progress on ensuring that human rights are respected, promoted and safeguarded."
"We have known for quite a while now that suffering, poverty, human rights violations, persecution on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, religion, culture or race are global phenomena."
"Millions of human beings have to suffer these affronts every single day."
"11 September reminded us that the breakdown of security is also a global phenomenon."
"This latest conference in Geneva, the first since that fateful day, should not, therefore, cause us to lose sight of our aims."
"We have to continue working to defend citizens' rights: the right to life, to democracy, to breathe clean air and to live in an environment in which economic and social rights are respected as an inseparable element of human rights."
"We must not forget that the balance between security and freedom is not only a demand that is coherent with our shared history, but that it is the only thing that can guarantee stability and, therefore, democracy."
"Europe must play a leading role in this conference."
"We have to be capable of defending a common position."
"Now, more than ever before, human rights must effectively be the backbone of EU policy."
"If we want to achieve this goal we need to have more political ambition and a single, forceful and radical voice against those who violate human rights."
"A voice that will be heard in Geneva and which makes us proud to be European."
"I know that this seems to be a Utopian vision, and appears difficult to achieve, and it is, but, as Guy Verhofstadt reminded us when he took office as President-in-Office of the Council under the Belgian Presidency: 'he who does not believe in Utopia does not deserve to be called European' ."
"Mr President, the United Nations Conference opens a week after the presidential elections in Zimbabwe."
"By then hand-wringing resolutions deploring human rights abuses by a re-elected Mugabe government would be no more meaningful than were the protests of the then League of Nations following Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia."
"The European Union has issued deadlines and ultimata."
"We must now gather support from the international community for those measures."
"We should thank President Mbeki and other African leaders for their work behind the scenes, but now is the time for them to speak out publicly and firmly against Mugabe's oppressive regime."
"We must make sure that the conditions of our ultimata are met in full."
"We must be sure that Mugabe will allow an EU team to observe the election process and the EU must be allowed to choose the make-up of that team, which should include British Members."
"Our observers must be free to move where they wish and free to report back."
"A genuine free press must be restored and recent media laws must be repealed."
"Above all, the murder, maiming and intimidation of political opponents must stop now."
"It is time for the world to judge Mugabe by his actions, not by his promises."
"By the same token, the world will judge the EU by its effectiveness, not by its rhetoric."
"Mr President, I have listened very carefully to the honourable Members' speeches, and, in my opinion, the wide variety of concerns that have been expressed here today clearly shows the complexity of the extraordinary task that is facing us in coordinating the European Union' s action in the Human Rights Commission."
"I am the first to recognise that the Human Rights Commission, being an international body in which compromises have to be made, is not exactly a forum in which the European Union can impose its principles and criteria; we have to reach agreement with others in order to pass effective resolutions, because we do not have a large enough majority to get approval for resolutions on all points, particularly on those we want approved."
"Although I recognise that many of the resolutions made by the Human Rights Commission leave much to be desired, I do not totally agree with Mr Dupuis' chaotic and pessimistic view; I share, instead, the optimistic, positive, idealistic and utopian vision that Mrs Rosa Díez is encouraging the Council to pursue in the defence of these values, which are our own and which Parliament advocates on a daily basis."
"Many issues have been mentioned, all of them extremely problematic: China, Tunisia, Zimbabwe and Turkey."
"All of these issues are on the agenda."
"We deal with them every day and significant progress has, of course, been made over the last few years."
"Without a doubt, the Human Rights Commission gets results every year, even though these may not be as far-reaching as our own ambitions and aspirations."
"However, there can be no doubt that the European Union should always be inspired by the desire to keep alive the flame of the fight for its basic principles and the defence of these, which I described in my opening speech."
"The Council feels encouraged and supported by Parliament in knowing that this is the true home of the desire to uphold these principles which are inseparable from our project, the European project."
"I would just like to make one specific comment to Mr Stockton with regard to Zimbabwe."
"Naturally, what takes place in the Human Rights Commission is important for Zimbabwe, but I would like to remind you that the General Affairs Council took decisions last Monday, which we are going to implement in Zimbabwe, to declare, through our actions and not through our words or aspirations, our policy, which has Parliament' s full support and which has been decided unanimously by the Council of Ministers of the European Union, as regards not permitting or tolerating the anti-democratic behaviour of Mr Mugabe' s government."
"And, consequently, all of the measures agreed upon by the Council will be implemented jointly by the Council and the Commission."
"I assure you, Mr President, that the Council is fully committed to the defence of the values and principles that are inherent to our culture, civilisation and to the Community acquis."
"The European Union and all of its countries that have a place on the Human Rights Commission are the bastion, the vanguard of the defence of these rights."
"This is our interpretation."
"I would only ask Parliament to give us the necessary room for manoeuvre and confidence to defend these interests, which are our own, those of our culture and civilisation, and to do so as forcefully as possible, so that this can be made a reality in international society, which is, of course, very complex and which, unfortunately, the European Union cannot manage completely on its own."
"It goes without saying that our contribution and our determination will never falter."
